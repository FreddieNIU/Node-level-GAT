How about you?"", ""Bill Mann: It's warmed up a little, so that's nice."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Yeah.', ""Bill Mann: I'm not part polar bear like a lot of people."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Last time I think we lost you due to snowfall so its good to get you back on the following week.', 'Bill Mann: I know people from the Northern climes laugh at the DMV when we talk about snowfall but it was actually legit. We had a legit snow.', ""Ricky Mulvey: I'll take your word for it. Let's talk about Netflix. Netflix got a big deal this morning. The streamer is paying $5 billion to get WWE raw for 10 years starting next January. The TKO Group which is the combination of the UFC and the WWE. Those investors are a little bit more excited than the Netflix investors. Talk to me. Why do you think Netflix is going heavy on these live events right now?"", ""Bill Mann: I love the fact that I've been called upon to talk about wrestling because I grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, which was the home of Dorton Arena. So we had all the time, Rowdy Roddy Piper and Dusty Rhodes, and the Russian Bear, Ivan Koloff, coming into our climb. Wrestling is something that is in my blood. But back in the '70s we would not have expected wrestling to go for $5 billion worth in terms of television viewing revenues. It's really staggering. I think from Netflix standpoint in some ways this is battening down the hatches in the area in which it probably feels like it has the most vulnerability versus other streaming services. They have not really done much or have they really successfully cracked the code on live entertainment. Wrestling is something that's interesting because it's live entertainment but it also has a longer tail than almost any other form of sports entertainment. I'm making up a number. But 95% of the people who watch a football game watch it within the first 24 hours. With wrestling you can go back and because there's a story line attached to it there is much more of a tail there and those are things that Netflix knows how to handle. It's a really interesting transaction to me because of those two things."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I also envision an executive conference room where the words scalable and repeatable are often being used about this. I remember 2017 my buddy was like you want to go to the WWE Monday Night Raw? I'm like this is going to be stupid but I'll go. Because I got nothing better to do. There's parts where I'm like this whatever. I like real sports. Braun Strowman and Big Show jump off the top turnbuckle and literally break the ring to finish the show and I was like this is sick. Let's go."", 'Bill Mann: See, I go back to the country boy, Haystacks Calhoun and 600 pounds worth of doing the same thing.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Bill, we're not talking about Haystacks Calhoun. We had our trip down Memory Lane. [laughs]"", 'Bill Mann: It is also a sport unlike the NFL with a huge international reach.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Yes.', ""Bill Mann: Netflix, you could call it a geographically unconcerned entity now has access to now has a recent Saudi Arabia for example which is not a huge market but it is one that is wild about wrestling and WWE and Raw is something that is going to do very well there and it's going to draw viewers in to the entire platform of Netflix."", ""Ricky Mulvey: They'll also pay some pretty big money to put on large shows there. I think what's also significant is that WWE on a Monday night unless there's Monday night football going on it is often the number 1, 2, and 3 cable television show. This is a signal for linear television where your top three dogs are literally leaving and WWE is saying, you know what? We're going to lose some of our audience because there's going to be friction in this transaction. Shout out to the Schwab discussion we'll have later. But they're saying this trade-off is going to be worth it or what Howard Stern did to radio and what Joe Rogan did to podcasting a little bit."", ""Bill Mann: It really does show and it's why just to make a little bit of a bizarre step in this conversation it is why content is still king. It is not to say that Disney hasn't had a huge amount of missteps for example including how they've managed their content. But at the end of the day if you were to ask me do I want to invest in a pipes company or do I want to invest in a content company it's the content company all the time."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's kick out, talk about Procter & Gamble. They reported this morning the expectations. But what's grabbing headlines is another Gillette write down for the razor maker. P&G bought it back in 2005 for $54 billion. Four years ago P&G took an $8 billion charge on Gillette. This quarter it's another $1.3 billion dollar write down. Bill Mann, what happened?"", ""Bill Mann: Accounting is such a funny thing. I just want to go back and emphasize that you're talking about a transaction that happened in 2005. It was $54 billion, it was about $95 billion in today's dollar. So it was a huge transaction for Procter & Gamble. But basically the way accounting works is they put that transaction on their books and it's considered an asset but they have to make a determination whether that asset is impaired or not. They're going back for an 18 year old transaction and they're saying we don't believe that we're going to make full value from that transaction for Gillette. It just goes to show in business how much stuff is left to chance. Because Procter & Gamble is a very savvy company. You're not talking about a company that goes out and does wild things. They went out and bought a dominant razor and blade company thinking that the environment in which they were operating in 2005 could last long enough that they would be able to you to regain their investments. AI is not a risk to people needing to shave. It just isn't. What they really didn't get right was that things actually did change."", ""Ricky Mulvey: They didn't. It's a story about pricing power. It's existed, it's a question I think for some product Procter & Gamble and right now though I'll also add grooming is watch me from Cincinnati play defense on this. [LAUGHTER]"", ""Ricky Mulvey: Grooming is the smallest segment for the company. It's 8% of sales. This is a multi-billion dollar company that still seems to be doing all right."", ""Bill Mann: I mean, that's the baseline. I think that's exactly right. Again, fascinating that we're talking about in 18 year plus ago transaction that is still on their books is being written up and down. A couple of things happened. One was that the distribution channels changed a little bit. You remember Dollar Shave Club, and they're fantastic ads, that bit a little bit. But what really bit into Procter & Gamble was at the time that they made this transaction, the thing that it seemed like the world was counting on was that the dollar was in a decline. What has happened almost linearly since 2005 is that the dollar has gone up against almost every other currency in the world. It's made it much more expensive to buy Gillette products. They call out places like Argentina and Nigeria, but those are simply placeholders for all of the countries that are outside of the US where the middle class is going to be price conscious. It has harmed this transaction for Procter & Gamble."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I want to exclude the write down. Let's adjust that gap bill. If you exclude the write down operating income would have been up 21% for the quarter year every year. This is as you said it's a company that's not affected by AI. It's not one that you would expect to be quickly growing like that. It still has some pricing juice left in it. In organic sales, you're still doing OK."", ""Bill Mann: You said something important and I'm going to pull back, and you said, let's ignore the write down, which is a fine thing to do because Procter & Gamble doesn't have many of them. It is a red flag when you see a company that has every quarter or every year, they've got a different write down. Because then they can say, that's non cash. When in actuality they spent cash and debt to buy this. It's the realest cash there is. Procter & Gamble is right to downplay this, write down in the impact to it. Because it was money that was spent 18 years ago. From an accounting perspective, it was right of them to do, but you are absolutely right that Procter & Gamble is doing absolutely fine, and 21% rise is nothing to sneeze at."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Before we go, I also I want to check in on Charles Schwab with you. Deidre, Matt Frankel took a look at the banking sector last week. I know you follow Charles Schwab. There's a pretty gloomy article about the company in the Wall Street Journal. It's maybe not a banking crisis, but Chuck still seems to be going through it. Looking at the latest quarter, there were a lot of parentheses in the wrong places bill. A year ago, Schwab paid about 800 million in interest expense on the quarter. This year it paid 1 billion more. How's that happen?"", ""Bill Mann: Well, you've heard about rates going up."", 'Ricky Mulvey: [laughs] It makes money on interest revenue.', 'Bill Mann: Not, exactly bight but you know who else does?', 'Ricky Mulvey: The savers? The people fighting T bills.', ""Bill Mann: Basically, since 2009, we have been punished to save. It has been absolutely fine at places like Charles Schwab. Charles Schwab isn't organized as a brokerage, it's organized as a savings and loan. That it is, at its core, a bank. For years, people who have not had their money invested in stocks, have had them in sweep accounts where you've been paid, 0.1% on your money. But as it turns out, when you go into a higher interest rate environment, it becomes beneficial for Schwab's customers to put their money that's not allocated to stocks or other investments into interest bearing instruments. That's where the billion comes. That's from members reinvesting their money, taking it out of cash, and putting it into interest bearing vehicles. That's something that's called cash sorting, and it is something that is costly to Schwab, but they had to expect it. I mean, it is something that was absolutely part of what a savings and loan at its core does."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yes, so Schwab lost essentially 175 billion in bank deposits, which is nearly 40% of what it had at its peak. That's bad. There's a version of this where that means you have a banking crisis, and Schwab doesn't seem to be having that."", ""Bill Mann: No, exactly. That's what's entirely different about what's happening at Schwab. In 2023, people after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed are like, what's the next one? There's Schwab, because under accounting standards, this seems like a banking crisis. But Schwab, they haven't been losing money. People haven't been withdrawing from Schwab. They've been taking bank deposits, and then transferring them into T bills, or transferring them into CD's. Or transferring them into higher interest bearing instruments, which changes the capital ratios at Charles Schwab. But Charles Schwab, unless they are forced to revalue the debt side of their balance sheet, it's not great for Charles Schwab, and it's really not great in an environment in which they are already undertaking a merger with TD Bank at all of those deposits. But it really is just the valley of the shadow of death that they've got to walk through. They're going through the fire swamp, that's what I would say, Ricky."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Fire swamp?', ""Bill Mann: Some would say that it's impossible to get to the other side, but Wesley and Buttercup did it. Schwab's going to do it too."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I mean, for as much friction as there is with the TD Ameritrade merger, they've got 15 million accounts going over, they've got basically 1.6 trillion in assets. Basically, everyone gets a letter at TD Ameritrade, which is a negative consent letter, meaning hey, if you want to opt out of this, you can credible. [laughs] Actually, I know the wealth management firms are not happy about that. Anytime you give just a reminder, if you want to leave, you can. They got they got a couple of frictions coming at them right now."", ""Bill Mann: They've got friction, but imagine thinking that a firm that has, $8 Trillion in client assets under management, and it's 33 million client accounts. It's just going to be allowed to fail by Uncle Sam because of a capital ratio. It's not going to happen. With Schwab, I look at a company that had a very, very bad year. Some of it was unfortunate, some of it was they had flown a little close to the sun. But at a baseline, the price that is available for Schwab now absolutely takes into account most reasonable case scenarios for the company. It's not good at Schwab but if you believe that a dominant bank with a history of innovation has a steady state, that steady state, I think is higher than it is now."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Uncle Sam, always looking out for the little guy. He's a Schwab shareholder bill, I hope that's the case. I hope they don't forget about them. But as always, Bill, appreciate your time and your insight."", 'Bill Mann: Thank you so much, Ricky.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Before we get to our ad in our next segment, I wanted to throw in a quick pitch that if you find value in the show, please leave us a review on Apple podcasts.

Dr. Michael Finke is a professor of wealth management and the director for the Granum Center for Financial Security at the American College of Financial Services. He caught up with Robert Brokamp to talk about his research in the first of a two part conversation."", 'Robert Brokamp: Michael, you have two PhDs. The first one you earned is in consumer economics. In that first chapter of your career, what did you learn about why some people make better choices when it comes to purchases like food, and how did that lead you to getting a PhD in finance?', ""Michael Finke: Wow, that it's an interesting part of my career. I was interested in knowing what motivated people to eat healthy foods. I found in my research that there was this amazing correlation between eating healthy foods, and exercising, and saving. I thought, well, there's got to be some an interesting theory that connects what motivates people to eat well and to also save. I took a finance class, it was actually a PhD class in investments. At the end of the class, I love the class, by the way. I thought it was so fascinating, I loved investments theory. At the end of the class, my professor took me aside and said, ''Do you realize how much more money you could be making if you were a PhD student in finance, than studying food consumption?'' That served as a jump for my second PhD in finance. Now, there was a lot of overlapping content between the two, because as much as finance, people don't want to admit it, it's just applied economics. I was doing applied economics when I was studying food consumption, and I'm still doing applied economics right now. It's just a topic that tends to be of interest to people who have money, which is a good thing as an economic."", 'Robert Brokamp: We recently did an episode on the correlation between health and wealth. In terms of cause and effect, we felt like it went both ways. Did you find what cause one or the other, or is it people just wired to be better with their money and their bodies?', ""Michael Finke: Yeah. There is this idea that one of the reasons why people who have more money live longer is perhaps because they have access to higher quality healthcare. Actually, there's really not a whole lot of evidence to support that. What seems to be happening is that the people who do things like eat better and exercise, and they are making investments in their health. Now, what is an investment? An investment is a sacrifice that you make in your joy today in order to experience more joy in the future. It really is just what we call an inter-temporal choice. Anytime we make an investment, whether it's eating the grilled chicken instead of having a hamburger for lunch, or whether it's getting up in the morning and going to the gym, as opposed to doing something that's maybe a little bit more fun, which is just about anything. All of those are motivated by this desire to live better in the future, and so that also motivates people to save more. I'm doing some interesting research right now on positivity, and I had no idea. We did this survey, we added a few questions about how positive is your outlook about the future. I didn't expect them to be really strong predictors of financial outcomes. They ended up being huge predictors of how much people save for retirement. Even things like asset allocation, or you're willing to take more risk if you have a more positive view of the future. All of this I think is just fascinating getting into what motivates us to choose one type of financial behavior or another, but it does seem to be a powerful way of thinking about that motivation is as an investment and investments in health, investments in relationships are similar to investments in mind."", ""Robert Brokamp: When it comes to retirement as a goal, which has really become much more of your focus. People have to decide on the price of that goal, starting with how much income they'll need to maintain their lifestyle and retirement. I'm sure that many people have heard that they'll need around 75% of their pre-retirement income when they retire. Is that a good starting point?"", ""Michael Finke: It depends. It could be higher, it could be lower. It could be higher if you earn less money, and it could be lower, if you earn more money. Now, that means that, let's say someone who's making between 100 and $200,000 a year. If you think about it, they're already saving especially if they're doing catch up contributions after the age of 50, they might be saving 15% or even 20% of their income. That's money that's not being spent. If they're making $200,000 a year, you're going to start at $160,000 right there. Then you've got payroll taxes that you don't have to pay in retirement, Social Security, Medicare taxes, you don't have to pay that stuff. That's another 15% if you're self-employed, half of that if you're employed with a company. The fact is that most people don't spend every single penny of their paycheck, especially people who watch shows like this, or there are people who tend to accumulate money in their savings account. What I found is if you look closely at the data even before retirement, someone who's making a couple $100,000 a year, probably only spending about 55-60% of that, that's the lifestyle that they need to replace in retirement."", ""That's good news, I think, especially in an environment where you believe that asset returns are going to be lower than they have been in the past. The goal is more attainable and of course, you have Social Security, which serves as a foundation. You simply have to make up the difference in that lifestyle over the course of an expected lifetime in retirement. Now, that lifetime in retirement, of course, we were talking about health investment. David Blanchett, who works at PGIM, used to work at Morning Star when I did a study where we looked at people who save and define contribution plans. People who save and defined contribution plans are different than the average American, because they tend to make more money. People who make more money are healthier, which means that it's far more likely that they're going to live on average into their late '80s, which means that their time horizon, if they retire at 65, is probably on average about 23-25 years. Then you have this uncertainty that surrounds how long the money needs to last, and boy, that is the ultimate issue is none of us know exactly how much money we need to save, because none of us knows exactly how long retirement is going to last, nor do we know the returns that we're going to get on our investment portfolio."", ""Robert Brokamp: There's also the question of how spending changes over the course of retirement. Because if you use a retirement calculator, or even the foundations of the old 4% rule, which we may talk about later, the assumption is that your expenses go up every year in retirement. But is that generally the case?"", 'Michael Finke: No.', ""Ricky Mulvey: There's two questions here. On average, how much does spending decline in real after-inflation terms? It does tend to go down. There's some differences of opinion based on the way people do research on this topic, but the reality is that we're not going to be able to spend as much money when we're 90 as we could when we were 70. Now the other part of that question is how much happiness are we going to get per dollar of going on vacation when we're 90 as opposed to going on vacation when we're 70. That is a compelling reason to front load some of that spending. But that makes retirement more risky because you're spending more early on. That means that you're more susceptible to what's known as a bad sequence of investment returns early on, you could significantly deplete your savings."", ""Think about it. You're a 65 year old healthy woman. You are, on average, going to live to age 90. Let's say you've got five rows of five circles, and you've got so much money saved, and you've got to decide how many chips you're going to put in each one of those circles. Do you put them all when you're 90? Do you conserve your chips so that they're left over if you live to be more than 90 or do you put more of your chips on 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 When you're more physically and cognitively capable of enjoying the money, that might make more sense. That's part of the game of life, is that we've got to figure out where to put our chips. If a lot of people just end up conserving their chips because they're worried about running out. That just means that your kids are going to spend the money. They're going to have the fun that you didn't have between the ages of 65 and 75."", ""Michael Finke: Some of your research has shown that for the median retiree, they're spending about 8% less than they probably could. For wealthier retirees, they're maybe even spending 50% less than they could, possibly, because they're so worried about running out of money."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, to me that's the big mystery. I have a new article coming out on this topic, which is why do so many people who say they are not that interested in passing money on to others after they're gone, why do they just not spend the money? I've done interviews with retirees and I consistently see how proud they are of the fact that they're not spending down their money. They're 10 years into retirement. They have more money than they did 10 years before. They're proud of it. Because they even look at me like, you're a finance guy, you should be proud of it too. I'm not. I think they're making a mistake. I think that they've, wasted 10 years essentially because they haven't spent the money in a more rational fashion. Now, if that's your goal, if you really want to pass it on after you're gone, then don't spend it like, that's fine. That's the way to win the game. But if that's not your goal, then there's only two places your money can go. You can either spend it on yourself or you can pass it on to others. If passing it on to others isn't that important to you, let's put together a plan for actually spending the money while you can still enjoy it."", ""Michael Finke: When you talk about how much someone can safely spend each year, that brings up the topic of safe withdrawal rates, which most people have heard of is 4%. Some say it's too low, some say it's too high. What's your take? I'm guessing that you don't agree with Dave Ramsey who in November said it should be 7% to 8%."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah. Dave Ramsey said that his mathematics was very clear. That is, since stocks always return 12% and inflation is 4% you should easily be able to withdraw 8% of your savings balance as your retirement income plan. Now, there are so many things wrong with that. You want to keep me focused here for a moment. But first of all, they don't actually return 12% because there's a difference between what's known as geometric returns and arithmetic returns. He's referring to the arithmetic average. Geometric is what you actually keep. In other words, if you have a year like 2022, your investments go down by 20% then you have to get a 25% return the next year just to get back to where you started."", ""On average, you may have had a 2.5% return, but you have exactly the same amount of money as when you started. That's the difference between arithmetic and geometric returns, so he's ignoring that. The other part that he's ignoring is what happens if you get unlucky at the very beginning of retirement. Let's say you have one million dollars, you're pulling $80,000 out the first year. What happens if your portfolio goes from a million down to $800,000. Now you're pulling $80,000 out of it. You have $720,000 at the end of Year 1. Do you again pull $80,000 out of there? Well, what happens if the market's flat now you're down to 640. It's not difficult to imagine that you're going to be out of money pretty quickly. In the early 2000, you can pretty much pick your year in the 2000. If you would have followed that strategy, it would have maybe taken anywhere between 10 and 15 year to run out of money if you would experience that same sequence of returns."", ""The sequence of returns risk is a very real thing. It means that you're going to have to significantly adjust your lifestyle downward if you get a bad sequence. You simply can't just be blind to whatever return that you got. That's what the 4% rule is based on. It is this idea that if I have one million dollars, I can spend $40,000 the first year. I can increase that by the rate of inflation that should last me over the course of 30 years. What happens if I get unlucky? What happens if my portfolio falls the first year? What if it falls again the second year? Do I continue to spend $40,000 a year plus inflation? At some point you're going to say, that's getting a little bit risky. I'm not comfortable with that. Maybe I should adjust that spending downward. That's what you should do. That is the way that a rational person would respond to a down market. They would spend less. I think that that which was known as a flexible withdrawal strategy or something that involves guard rails."", ""In other words, you could maybe go up by a half a percent per year or something like that, that's the right way to do it. That allows you to pull more money out at the beginning, by the way, because you know you spend more early on in retirement as long as you're willing to make adjustments. If you get unlucky and remember that bad luck, that's going to cause you to have to adjust your spending downward. But what if you get good luck? In other words, what if at the beginning of retirement you have a positive sequence of returns, then should you not spend more? It shouldn't just be your financial advisor and your kids who benefit from the risk that you took, you should be able to spend more also. That's what's known as flexible spending rule, I'm a big fan of that. I think that's the right way to do it. Now, you can do a flexible spending rule only if you have the ability to be flexible in your spending. That's why I think one of the stages of planning for retirement income is evaluating how flexible you are capable of being with your retirement budget. Because if you do have a segment of the budget which is simply not flexible, then you can't take investment risk with that portion of the budget. You're going to have to cover it with Social Security and some other strategy that is not going to require you to cut back if you get on money."", ""As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned in the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

It looks like the results were pretty good overall. While revenues of US$3.0b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory losses were much smaller than expected, with Western Digital losing US$0.87 per share. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Western Digital ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Western Digital's 21 analysts is for revenues of US$12.7b in 2024. This would reflect a decent 12% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Losses are predicted to fall substantially, shrinking 59% to US$2.90. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$12.3b and losses of US$4.31 per share in 2024. There's been a pretty noticeable increase in sentiment, with the analysts upgrading revenues and making a considerable decrease in loss per share in particular."", ""It will come as no surprise to learn thatthe analysts have increased their price target for Western Digital 19% to US$62.98on the back of these upgrades. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Western Digital analyst has a price target of US$82.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$33.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. For example, we noticed that Western Digital's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with revenues forecast to exhibit 27% growth to the end of 2024 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 4.9% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 5.0% annually. Not only are Western Digital's revenues expected to improve, it seems that the analysts are also expecting it to grow faster than the wider industry."", 'The most obvious conclusion is that the analysts made no changes to their forecasts for a loss next year. Pleasantly, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.', ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Western Digital analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Western Digital (at least 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  , and understanding these should be part of your investment process."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Whirlpool numbers out. 2024 outlook disappointing Wall Street. Sales and earnings guidance trailing estimates. And the company is expecting now to further reset its cost structure with an additional $300 million to $400 million of a reduction in costs. Basically, people aren't upgrading appliances at the same rate here."", ""Revenue, it says, will be about $16.9 billion this year. Analysts on that basis had been looking for $17.7 billion.

Based on the closing price of $239.10 per share on Jan 26, 2024, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.2% and a payout ratio of 4%.Although it maintained its dividend payout since 2008, the company’s decision to hike its quarterly dividend this time was attributable to improved cash flow generation and efforts to sustain a healthy balance sheet.

These priorities are anchored on the company’s efforts to increase product vitality through new product introductions and enhancements to its existing portfolio, strategically utilizing technology in both its Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls (ABL) and Intelligent Spaces Group (ISG) businesses and elevating service levels.During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the company’s adjusted earnings of $3.72 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.4% and grew 13.1% year over year. The uptrend was backed by the company’s strong execution of its effective capital-allocation strategy along with increased contributions from its ISG business.Furthermore, during the quarter, Acuity Brands reported a 1.6% increase in cash flow from operations of $190 million, attributable to an improvement in net income. Its efforts to ensure consistent capital allocation in growing its business and driving shareholders’ value signifies the continuance of outperformance in the near term.For fiscal 2024, AYI expects net sales in the range of $3.7-$4 billion compared with the reported figure of $3.95 billion in fiscal 2023.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have surged 50.2% in the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Lighting industry’s 44.3% growth.The positive trend is solidified by the upward movement of the fiscal 2024 earnings estimates to $14.79 per share from $14.44 per share in the past seven days.

With three consecutive weeks of gain and 12 out of 13 weeks in positive territory, Wall Street's benchmark has demonstrated resilience.Following a notable decline in the inflation rate last year, the Federal Reserve responded by initially scaling back the intensity of interest rate hikes and eventually halting them altogether in July 2023. This strategic decision contributed to an impressive 23.9% rally in the S&P 500 Index last year.Going forward in 2024, the Fed is poised to implement an interest rate reduction. This move is anticipated to be favorable for stock markets, as a lower risk-free interest rate will decrease the discount rate, positively impacting the net present value of equity investments. Bolstered by robust economic growth in the fourth quarter, the outlook for markets in 2024 remains optimistic.In light of this favorable scenario, astute investors are concentrating on relative price performance, strategically identifying and capitalizing on promising opportunities that offer the potential for accelerated returns."", 'Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures a winning option on your hands.\xa0Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen.

This plan will also enable the company to deliver value creation and sustainable growth in the long term.Spectrum Brands is on track with its four core pillars to drive growth. In this regard, the company is streamlining its organizational structure and re-energizing its employee base. It is committed to improving operational efficiencies throughout and limiting risk.

In other words, about 2% of the world’s population is homeless. According to United Nations reports, there are 1.6 billion people worldwide living in inadequate housing conditions, and about 15 million are evicted every year. Out of all the OECD countries, the US has the highest number of house evictions per renting household— a 2023 study by the Yale Department of Economics delves deeper into the topic, explaining how evictions result in a direct negative impact on the economy. Unfortunately, homelessness has continued to increase at an alarming rate in the past decade.\xa0\xa0', 'In some regions like the Middle East, the primary reason for high rates of homelessness is conflicts between two countries, which results in high collateral damages and infrastructural loss. Moreover, some countries suffer from natural calamities that destroy residential units, and when the people or the government don’t have enough money to rebuild, the victims remain homeless.\xa0\xa0', ""However, in other cases, homelessness is a byproduct of unaffordable housing. With housing prices skyrocketing globally and people not earning enough to afford a house, it’s common to be homeless in quite a few countries. According to the IMF's 2021 report on global house pricing, many socio-economic factors contributed to the boom in house prices, alongside low interest rates and unfavorable government support policies. The\xa0 International Labor Organization, reports that global unemployment grew to 5.2% in 2023, and in 2024 more than 2 million people will be looking for jobs. Put simply, global unemployment is on the rise, which in turn, makes it increasingly difficult for millions of people around the world to buy groceries, let alone pay rent or mortgage."", 'Given the rapid rise in the phenomenon, it’s safe to conclude that homeless people exist in every city, although there might be different reasons for all.

This is one way to bring down homelessness, but it’s not a sustainable solution.', 'The key to reducing homelessness is building more houses, to meet the demands of a growing population and increasing housing supply demands to reduce competition and bring down the rents and mortgages.

The company’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust’s (REIT) normalized FFO per share of 96 cents narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Rental income lagged the consensus mark, and results reflected a weak performance in its West Coast markets, along with the Rite Aid bankruptcy.Over the trailing four quarters, Equity Residential met the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions for as many misses, the average negative surprise being -0.54%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:', 'Equity Residential price-eps-surprise | Equity Residential Quote', ""As we approach the release of Equity Residential's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings report, it is important to examine how this residential REIT is likely to have performed amid the current market conditions."", 'Per RealPage data, although there was a significant recovery in apartment demand in the fourth quarter, it was not enough to keep up with the huge amounts of new supply, with the onslaught affecting occupancy and rent growth.There was demand for 58,200 units in the fourth quarter, pushing the total demand figure to 233,741 units in the 12-month period, which marked a considerable change from net move-outs from 123,290 units recorded in 2022. However, there were massive amounts of new supply, with 129,015 units being delivered in the fourth quarter across the top 150 markets tracked by RealPage, bringing the total number of units delivered to 439,394 in 2023.With supply outpacing demand, the occupancy level was 94.2%, contracting 30 basis points (bps) in the quarter and 90 points year over year. Apart from the occupancy rate, operators’ pricing power was also affected, with fourth-quarter rents contracting 1.3% but increasing 0.2% in the year. The monthly rent was $1,805, while the rent per square foot was $1.986.', 'Amid this rebound in demand, Equity Residential’s quarterly performance is likely to have been supported by its portfolio diversification efforts in the urban and suburban markets. EQR’s target residents are more affluent, with lower unemployment and favorable prospects ahead.The company has a healthy balance sheet and banks on technology, scale and organizational capabilities to drive growth. EQR’s robust balance sheet position is expected to have supported its development activities during the to-be-reported quarter.However, rising supply and the winter months are likely to have played a spoilsport. Per its November Investor Update presentation, news lease change was down 3.1% in October compared to an increase of 0.5% in the third quarter, and the renewal rate achieved in October was 5% compared with 5.5% in the third quarter. The blended rate in October was 1.6%, down from 3.1% in the third quarter.We expect fourth-quarter same-store revenues to decline 3.8% year over year, while same-store net operating income (NOI) is estimated to decline 1.5%. Physical occupancy is expected at 95.9%, suggesting a 10-basis point decrease sequentially.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s quarterly revenues stands at $727.55 million, indicating a 3.98% increase year over year.For the fourth quarter of 2023, Equity Residential projected normalized FFO per share in the band of 99 cents-$1.01.However, before the fourth-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly normalized FFO per share has remained unchanged in the past month at $1.00. Nevertheless, it suggests year-over-year growth of 6.38%.For the full year 2023, Equity Residential projected normalized FFO per share in the band of $3.77-$3.79. The company’s full-year guidance incorporates a same-store revenue growth projection of 5.5%, while expenses are expected to increase by 4.25%. Consequently, NOI is estimated to expand 6.2%. Physical occupancy is expected at 95.9%.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for normalized FFO per share is pegged at $3.77. The figure indicates a 7.1% increase year over year on 5.1% year-over-year growth in revenues to $2.87 billion.', 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Equity Residential this season.

I think more likely than not, the Biden administration is creating a calibrated military response that appears very loud in terms of targeting militias in Iraq and Syria to rebuild that lost US deterrence on the military front.

I mean, do you agree that potential disruption to oil markets pretty much contained there and that the broader concern as it relates to the energy space really is about the demand picture, largely coming out of China too?', ""SCOTT BAUER: No doubt about it, and I wholeheartedly agree. I do think even now with oil prices down today, there's probably about $3 to $4 of risk premium already built in because of tensions in the Middle East, especially with what happened over the weekend. But you can see the reaction today, it really goes to what you guys were just talking about. That the response is probably going to be very tempered. And the bottom line is, oil prices are on their heels right now."", ""And it is all because of demand or lack of it, should we say. We do have OPEC coming out next week, which given everything that's going on, given the tensions in the Middle East, that could disrupt the marketplace. But I really don't think so. So to me as a trader, I actually love this extra volatility. And though much of the marketplace is looking at this as a buy the dip because of the escalated tensions out there, I actually look at this as selling what we call selling the rip or selling a move higher."", ""Because the overall macro picture of crude is absolutely on the bearish side. Obviously, things can escalate very quickly. You can always have a big pop, if God forbid, something really tragic happens here. So if you're trading, if you're trading with options or just with futures, you always need to use a star. But I would look to sell any pop that we get in the near term."", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: So, Ayham, in terms of the response that we tend to see from OPEC as we saw with the Russia Ukraine crisis in the Middle here, what response are you expecting from OPEC at the upcoming meeting?', ""AYHAM KAMEL: Well, I think Saudi Arabia, who really exactly is the engine of OPEC plus, will be looking at a very comfortable price range. I think for the Saudis, OPEC plus in general, any range of oil prices and the '80s is completely acceptable. There's not likely to be a big reaction to put additional barrels on the market in the current environment. One exception to that would be if we saw an escalation of the regional conflict and it begins to impact supplies."", ""Then the Saudis would consider to work more actively with OPEC plus to try to create some form of relief over there. But currently, given just the demand picture that we've discussed on the show and the supply risks as they are, the Saudis will be cautious in terms of putting additional. Or taking barrels or putting additional barrels on the market sale stable status quo works for now, particularly given the spending commitments on Vision 2030."", 'And I think that the Saudis can deliver on that. One key point I would just add, that things-- yes, there is an intention by the Biden administration to calibrate its response. But military conflicts and regional crises have the tendency to create their own dynamics. Where we are today is not a very comfortable place in terms of risks in general. I do expect additional tit for tat military strikes and confrontation between the US and the militias in Iraq and Syria. This is not going to be a comfortable couple of weeks at all.']"

Geopolitical tensions and China’s ramped-up efforts to revive its economy further supported the commodity.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures gained 72 cents (or 1%), to close at $75.09 a barrel yesterday.We believe that oil’s current levels of around $75 allow long-term-oriented market participants to buy shares in quality companies at attractive prices. Investors interested in the sector could benefit from having quality stocks like Oceaneering International OII, Helix Energy Solutions Group HLX and Sunoco LP SUN in their portfolios.Let\'s dig deep into EIA’s Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Jan 19.', 'Crude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 9.2 million barrels compared to analyst expectations of a 3 million-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Commodity Insights. The big stockpile decline with the world’s biggest oil consumer was largely thanks to the slump in imports and production from the winter storm-led shut-ins.Total domestic stock now stands at 420.7 million barrels — 6.2% lower than the year-ago figure of 448.5 million barrels and 5% less than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 2 million barrels to 30.1 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 25.9 days in the previous week to 25.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.8 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the ninth time in 10 weeks. The 4.9-million-barrel jump was primarily attributable to a pullback in demand as inclement weather kept motorists off the road. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would gain 1 million barrels. At 253 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 9.1% more than the year-earlier level, while it is 1% higher than the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) fell for the first time in nine weeks. The 1.4-million-barrel drop mainly reflected a pullback in production and higher demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of 81,000 barrels. Despite last week’s decrease, current inventories — at 133.3 million barrels — are 15.6% above the year-ago level, though it is 4% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 85.8%, fell 6.8% from the prior week as many units had to reduce runs and halt operations due to weather-related outages.', 'Having gone through the Weekly Petroleum Status Report, investors interested in the energy sector might look at operators like Oceaneering International, Sunoco LP and Helix Energy Solutions Group.

And along the way, the company will lean hard into new AI tools to help its customers with their marketing, customer service, and digital experience developments and improvements.', ""Perhaps the growth engine can take it up a notch in 2024. But management's focus at the investor day event was on long-term profit margin targets. In the last reported quarter, adjusted operating profit margin was 16.2%, or negative 3.7% on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis.

As of last September, it had nearly $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and another $151 million in long-term investments, offset by convertible debt of $456 million.', ""While HubSpot makes progress toward positive GAAP profit margins (the biggest drag between this and adjusted operating profit being employee stock-based compensation, at $319 million the first nine months of 2023), it could use its cash to fire up a stock buyback plan. This would offset the dilutive effects of stock-based compensation on shareholders, and would no doubt be cheered by the market's renewed vigorous focus on the bottom line."", 'Making a change like this has certainly made Salesforce investors happy. Something similar could work the same way for HubSpot.', 'The rally in HubSpot last year has the stock trading for a premium again. Shares currently trade for nearly 120 times trailing-12-month free cash flow, compared to about 31 times free cash flow for Salesforce.', ""Clearly, to justify the premium, HubSpot will need to keep its high-growth momentum going and make some dramatic progress in generating cash from its business.

Generative AI’s potential has been touted as almost limitless, but the proven use cases currently focus on text generation, text summation, and text-to-image generation, per Luria.', 'These use cases are most relevant in tasks like pre-populating emails, summarizing calls, and answering common questions — all functions built into Salesforce’s (CRM) AI assistant, Einstein Copilot, which is targeting the end of February for a public launch.', ""Morgan Stanley recently upgraded the company's stock to a top pick, citing its consistent revenue growth and relatively muted trading multiples compared to its peers."", 'Data is worth gold in the AI age, so investors should look for firms that lead the field in data access and integration.

Many of these long-standing, high-quality companies pay a dividend to shareholders, and these can be some of the most consistent dividend payers in the market.', ""But when dividend yields climb too high, it might be a warning sign for investors. A stock might have a high dividend yield because the outlook for the business (or the dividend itself) doesn't bode well. While the following three companies are all part of the premier blue chip index, investors need to dive deeper before jumping into a stock simply for its payout."", ""Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) has offered a generous dividend for a long time, but its yield has moved substantially higher over the last 18 months. That's not a result of its dividend increases (although the company has raised its dividend for 17 years straight). It's the result of a significant decline in the stock price."", ""Verizon shares were punished as the company faced significant costs in building out its 5G network while seeing an exodus of customers. Meanwhile, the debt-laden business was challenged by rising interest rates, which presented a double-whammy for Verizon shares since investors could get a relatively high and safe yield from treasuries instead of buying Verizon's shares."", 'The company appears to have turned the corner, though. It saw a net increase of 100,000 in total postpaid phone customers in the third quarter, bolstered by its business segment. It built on that momentum in the fourth quarter with 449,000 net postpaid phone adds, showing significant strength in the consumer segment with 318,000 net additions.', 'Meanwhile, forthcoming interest-rate cuts should provide some nice support for the stock. Still, Verizon has the challenge to maintain market share in the wireless industry, and growth from its home broadband business may not be sustainable. There are better investment options in the telecom sector, although few yield as much as Verizon.', ""For investors who are particularly attracted to Verizon's dividend yield, the dividend is relatively safe. Verizon's free cash flow can support the current payout. And with the stock trading at around 8x management's outlook for 2024 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), it's a fair value."", ""3M (NYSE: MMM) has paid a dividend for more than 100 years and raised its payout to shareholders for 64 consecutive years. But its share price has fallen considerably faster than its dividend has increased over the past three years. That's resulted in a substantially elevated dividend yield, which now stands around 6.25%."", ""There are a few reasons for 3M's price decline. After strong sales growth amid the pandemic, thanks to surging demand for masks and respirators, 3M faced a hangover following the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines and the end of mask mandates. Meanwhile, the company faced a lawsuit for its earplugs used by the U.S. Military. It settled that lawsuit in 2023, agreeing to pay $6 billion."", ""But there may be signs of other underlying issues for 3M as well. It's not spending as much on research and development (R&D) as it used to. R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, fell to just 5.6% over the past four quarters, near its lowest levels in the past decade."", ""Instead, it's relying more on acquisitions to fuel growth, which comes with a lot more risk and lower return on capital. That's a bit concerning, considering the company's biggest competitive advantage is its ability to innovate."", ""That said, the market's punishment of the stock may have gone too far after an 11% drop in the share price following 3M's disappointing 2024 outlook alongside its fourth-quarter results. Shares currently trade around 10x analysts' consensus estimate for its 2024 earnings per share. And with management prioritizing the dividend, it's hardly at risk of collapsing."", 'If you want a high-yield dividend stock with excellent prospects for annual raises, you could do worse than 3M.', 'Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) held the title as the highest-yielding Dow Jones stock until earlier this month. Management slashed its dividend in half, alongside the release of its fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings report, ending a streak of 47 years of dividend increases.', ""The company suffered from pressure to raise its dividend every year, while earnings couldn't always keep up with the growing payout."", ""Meanwhile, the company's seen a significant decline in free cash flow, and the cost of borrowing has increased substantially. As a result, management had to make the tough decision to cut the dividend. Yet Walgreens Boots Alliance remains one of the highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones."", ""Walgreens faces challenges from online pharmacies and big-box retailers offering pharmacy services in their stores. In order to combat this competition, it's pushed into healthcare services with its majority stake in VillageMD. At one point, it counted over 200 full-service clinics inside Walgreens stores but is committed to closing 60 underperforming locations this year as part of its cost-cutting efforts."", ""Still, Walgreens' effort to expand beyond the retail pharmacy business could work out well. If customers are coming into its VillageMD locations to see a doctor, there could be valuable synergies with the pharmacy business."", ""Investors have punished Walgreens for the company's poor results and the dividend cut. That said, shares now trade around 7x analysts' consensus earnings estimate for 2024."", 'If you believe the worst is behind Walgreens -- that it can return to earnings growth and accommodate the new dividend -- the yield on the stock is still well above average.

So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 11% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal.

That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""Paychex provided a TSR of 10% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market.

(NYSE:ADM), which is more commonly referred to by its ticker symbol, is headquartered in Chicago and has been a key U.S.-based player in both the global processing of food and the global trade in agricultural commodities since being founded in 1902.', 'Since its inception, ADM has had explosive growth. Starting out as just a domestic operator, the company very quickly expanded and now runs a large-scale logistical network enabling the transport of various goods, whether it be by rail, road or sea. Its extensive operations include over 400 crop procurement locations, 750 storage facilities and 100 processing plants spread across six continents that serve more than 200 countries. This global footprint enables ADM to transform various different cereal grains and oil seeds into products that are crucial for the food and animal feed sectors.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS.', 'Source: 2022 annual report', 'Further strengthening its global presence, ADM, through its various subsidiaries, owns 10 oceangoing vessels and charters many others out daily, thus positioning it as a player within both the agricultural commodity and dry bulk shipping spaces.', 'ADM works closely with farmers in its day-to-day operations and not only delivers its own fertilizers to these farmers, but also facilitates the transportation and storage of various agricultural products produced by the very same farmers.', ""This serves as a very nice feedback loop that benefits both the farmers and ADM, as the company's primary revenue stream stems from service fees collected through the transportation, storage and processing of these agricultural goods on a domestic and global scale. This strategic approach stands to ensure a steady income for the company while positioning ADM as a crucial link in the global supply chain, connecting farmers to producers and end consumers."", ""Given that grains, oilseeds, livestock and other agricultural products are at the core of ADM's business, I think it is important we look into macro supply and demand data from an official source which covers the greater agricultural spaces ADM does business in. One such source would be through the data obtained and reported by the United States Department of Agriculture, otherwise known as the USDA."", ""The USDA is responsible for overseeing various aspects of the nation's food supply. This includes food safety, nutrition and the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices. In addition to these responsibilities, the USDA also provides support to farmers and conducts research on agriculture and rural development and sets regulatory standards for the nation's food supply."", 'As a component of its research initiatives, the USDA reliably issues monthly reports that delve into the various supply and demand dynamics within agricultural sectors. The most comprehensive out of these reports are the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates, which offer thorough forecasts and analysis of domestic and global supply and demand for key agricultural commodities.', ""Considering the expansive scope of the USDA's agricultural operations, incorporating the latest data and projections from its reports into our own macro views on a company's performance within the sector could provide valuable insights. From this point onward, I will be summarizing the latest report while focusing on aspects that point toward either increased production or increased demand across various different categories."", 'The projected wheat for 2023-24 U.S. ending stocks were lowered by 11 million bushels due to decreased supplies and a reduction in seed use to 64 million bushels. The average farm price for the season is forecasted to end at $7.20 per bushel, this will reflect a 10-cent decrease based on current prices and expectations for the remainder of 2023-24.', 'Globally, the outlook for the period indicates larger supply, increased consumption, rising trade volumes and higher ending stocks compared to the previous month, with global supplies raised to 1.05 billion tons.', 'In coarse grains, particularly corn, the 2023-24 U.S. outlook shows significantly greater production, larger food, seed and industrial use at a record high of 15.3 billion bushels, up 108 million, mainly driven by a record high yield of 177.3 bushels per acre.', 'Corn used for ethanol was increased by 50 million bushels to a total of 5.4 billion bushels, while feed and residual use was increased to 5.7 billion bushels, representing a 25 million bushel increase. The season average corn price received by producers was lowered by 5 cents to $4.80 per bushel.', 'Globally, coarse grain production for 2023-24 is forecasted to increase by 11.90 million tons to 1.51 billion, primarily attributed to increased production in China and increased trade volumes from major producing countries.', ""This increased yield and demand for both corn and wheat should especially benefit ADM as it has lots of exposure to these markets. According to its 2022 annual report, the company owns three out of five of the world's largest corn mills. They had a grind capacity of 2.5 million bushels per day. Additionally, ADM was able to process 950,000 bushels of wheat per day."", 'Source: 2022 annual report', 'The rice outlook in the U.S. indicates slightly higher supply, unchanged domestic use, lower exports and higher ending stocks. Globally, there is a reduction in supply, consumption, trade and ending stocks, with world ending stocks lowered to 167.3 million tons.', 'In oilseeds, U.S. production for 2023-24 is estimated at 122.4 million tons, up 0.9 million from last month with increased soybean, rapeseed and sunflower seed crops, partly offset by peanut and cottonseed. The soybean production estimate went up to 4.2 billion bushels, an increase of 35 million bushels, the increase is expected to impact soybean supplies and ending stocks.', 'Global soybean production estimates rose 0.1 million tons to 399 million tons, representing a slight increase with notable increases in Argentina, the United States, Russia, China, Paraguay and Bolivia that were offset by lower Brazil production.', 'This net increase in oilseed production should have a positive impact on ADM operating cash flows as the company has the most exposure to this market, boasting a whopping 400 procurement and storage facilities with a global capacity of 20 million metric tons, 42 owned and leased port facilities, 10,000 owned Railcars, 1,200 owned semi-trailers, three owned oceangoing vessels, 1,800 owned river barges, 52 oilseed crush facilities with a total crushing capacity of 41 million metric tons and 109 processing facilities.', 'Source: 2022 annual report', ""It is worth noting that operating profits between the period of 2020 and 2022 more than doubled, going from $2.1 billion in 2020 to $4.386 billion in 2022. This substantial increase was primarily fueled by increased demand in the company's Ag Services and Oilseed Crushing segment."", 'Source: 2022 Annual Report', ""The sugar section projects Mexico's production for 2023-24 at 5.01 million metric tons, a decrease of 267,000 from last month. This decrease in production is primarily driven by the severity of drought conditions in municipalities where sugar processing plants are located. The current forecasts indicate far worse conditions than last year with current conditions being more comparable to that experienced in the low production year of 2019-20."", 'Despite the harsh conditions in Mexico, U.S. sugar supply has increased by 189,687 short tons, raw value on higher U.S. production and higher demand for imports. This has resulted in much higher U.S. exports of sugar than previous years and will primarily be delivered to Mexico.', 'Cotton forecasts for the period include lower U.S. production, exports and ending stocks. Production is reduced by 342,000 bales to 12.4 million bales, with Texas contributing to most of the decline. The season average upland price received by farmers is projected 1 cent lower this month at 76 cents per pound.', 'Livestock', ""The USDA's data on Livestock was much more comprehensive than the other categories as there was a lot to unpack."", ""According to the USDA's data, there was an increase in red meat and poultry production for 2023, driven by higher outputs of beef, pork and broilers in the last quarter. This uptick is attributed to November production figures and preliminary estimates for December, with egg production also experiencing a boost. Looking forward to 2024, the USDA predicts heightened beef production, particularly in the first half of the year, fueled by increased cattle slaughter and higher dressed weights."", 'Pork production is expected to rise in the first half of 2024, while broiler production also gets a boost based on recent hatchery statistics.', 'Conversely, turkey production is forecasted to dip in the first half of 2024 due to lower hatchery numbers and expected pricing pressures.', 'Egg production unfortunately faces a reduction due to culling related to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.', 'The USDA notes a decline in beef exports for 2023 along with increased imports based on recent trade data.', 'Looking ahead to 2024 expectations, higher beef imports, primarily from Oceania, are projected, while export forecasts are lowered due to weakened sales in certain Asian markets.', 'For pork, imports remain unchanged for 2023, but exports are on the rise. In 2024, pork imports are expected to stabilize while exports are projected to experience a slight increase.', 'Broiler exports are up for both 2023 and 2024, while turkey exports show a decline in 2023 but a rebound in 2024, driven by competitive pricing expectations.', 'In terms of pricing, cattle prices for 2023 remained steady and hog prices are expected to decrease in 2024 due to soft demand and an increase in hog supplies. However, Broiler prices are projected to rise in 2024 due to the strong demand seen in late 2023.', 'Turkey prices for 2024 are expected to decrease, influenced by continued soft demand from the previous year.', 'Egg prices in 2024 are higher due to recent prices and the impact of Avian Influenza on flock size.', ""The agricultural report presents a mixed outlook across the various agricultural commodities. However, the prevailing trend found in most categories presents us with notably increased production paired with relatively steady, if not decreasing, supplies. This indicates the broader demand for agricultural goods remains very high despite record amounts of production, this increased demand is made even more apparent when reviewing the price chart of Invesco's Diversified Agriculture Fund (DBA), which has sharply risen 5.62% over just an 11-day period, thus bringing it back above the highs of 2023 and signifying a bullish breakout of a cup with handle pattern that could bring much further upside."", ""The holdings of this exchange-traded fund consists of a basket of futures contracts for the various different agricultural goods reviewed, including wheat, corn, soybeans and sugar, with the addition of other similar goods, all of which are markets that ADM has a footprint in. This rising demand for agricultural goods should theoretically translate into higher demand for ADM's agricultural services, the effects of increased demand have seemingly already been felt when reviewing its total operating cash profits which have risen from $3.40 billion in 2020 to the all-time high of $6.60 billion in 2022."", 'Source: 2022 annual report', ""This growth has also been witnessed to an even greater extent in the company's earnings per share, which has consistently risen for the last several years, going from a low of $2.16 in 2016 all the way to a high of $7.85 in 2022."", 'Source: 2022 annual report', 'In addition to rising profits and operating cash flows, the company also maintains a low debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 1.30, thus signaling it is well positioned for any financial stresses that could come its way if the economy were to tighten.', 'Source: 2022 annual report', ""Along with its low debt, the company also maintains high credit ratings and high credit capacity, receiving investment-grade ratings from the top credit ratings agencies: S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch."", 'Source: 2022 annual report', 'Source: tradingview.com', ""ADM currently sits within the pattern completion zone of a Bullish Gartley, aligning with the 800 period exponential moving average and the support zone of $53.96 to $49.98 with record-breaking volumes exceeding 60 million total shares traded during the last three days. This was also the highest three-day period trading volume seen since February of 2007. This heightened activity comes in light of the recent news surrounding Chief Financial Officer Vikram Luthar being put on administrative leave due to SEC investigations into the company's accounting practices, particularly focusing on the accounting done within the its nutrition segment. This volatile trading activity has since settled down at support following the company appointing a new interim CFO, Ismael Roig, which has seemingly put investors at ease. If the support level holds, it is very likely that ADM could see share prices appreciate to the nearest top level resistance zone of $85 to $90."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.3%, which is fairly typical for the industry."", ' View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland ', ""Unless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Before making this announcement, Archer-Daniels-Midland was paying a whopping 197% as a dividend, but this only made up 24% of its overall earnings. A cash payout ratio this high could put the dividend under pressure and force the company to reduce it in the future if it were to run into tough times."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 26.8% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 37%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.', 'The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.76 total annually to $1.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.0% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.', ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Archer-Daniels-Midland has been growing its earnings per share at 13% a year over the past five years. Archer-Daniels-Midland definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio."", ""In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Archer-Daniels-Midland's payments are rock solid. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We don't think Archer-Daniels-Midland is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

Late last year, Chinese state-owned Huawei quietly launched the Mate 60 Pro, a 5G phone that stunned analysts. The Western-sanctioned firm had acquired advanced 7-nanometer chips that only ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) and its customers were thought to produce. (Some believe that Huawei’s suppliers secretly procured ASML machines).', 'This is only the start.

At its peak in 2016, Intel held an 81% market share in global CPU shipments.', 'However, Intel staked its fortunes on vertical integration. Unlike rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel manufactures the chips it designs. In good times, this helps turbocharge Intel’s bottom line by capturing more of the value chain. But several R&D missteps in 2018-2020 left Intel a full generation of chips behind. It is now struggling to produce 10-nanometer technologies even as rivals churn out 7-nanometer chips.', 'The hard truth is that Intel’s gambit of “leapfrogging” to 2-nanometer chips is risky at best. And even if it succeeds, the firm will likely trail Samsung in getting mass production into market.', 'But don’t count Intel out just yet. The Silicon Valley company will be the largest recipient of U.S. AI grants, which could pour over $4 billion into local semiconductor manufacturing plants (known as “fabs”). And future chip import restrictions will likely give Intel a leg up over rivals.', 'It’s why, in his Smart Money letter, Eric calls Intel the top candidate to become the next trillion-dollar AI company.', 'Simply put, Intel stands at the ready with a roster of offerings that can help power the AI Revolution.', 'The company remains a top dog and, even with some pullbacks, it has been on a growth trajectory recently.

Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and matched once, delivering an earnings surprise of 4.5%, on average.', 'Let’s check out the factors that have shaped BDX’s performance prior to this announcement.', 'On fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in November, BD confirmed that it continued to witness lower COVID-only testing revenues. However, excluding COVID-only testing, the Life Sciences segment’s base revenues witnessed growth driven by strength in the Biosciences (BDB) business unit.', 'The segment’s base revenues also grew on an underlying basis, which reflected the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions business unit’s base business growth. This was driven by the continued adoption of BD KIESTRA microbiology lab automation solution, strong IDAST instrument placements and continued growth of BD’s molecular In Vitro Diagnostic assays, leveraging the BD core system and expanded BD MAX installed base.', 'BDB’s performance reflected growth in Research Instruments driven by strong demand for the company’s BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter and strength in Clinical Reagents leveraging its growing installed base of FACSLyric analyzers and FACSDuet automation.', 'These trends are likely to have continued in first-quarter fiscal 2024. This, in turn, is anticipated to have contributed to the strength in base business despite the expected ceaseless fall in COVID-only testing revenues. This is likely to have significantly driven up the segmental revenues.', 'In December 2023, BD received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the BD MiniDraw Capillary Blood Collection System.

Per management, the value-creating transaction will likely support the achievement of BD 2025 financial goals and advance the segment’s focus on high-growth end markets. Management also believes that the divestiture will allow it to focus on BD Surgery’s strategic investments In Advanced Repair and Reconstruction and surgical complications, which are driving results and helping to address unmet needs in healthcare. The company is likely to have benefited from the divestiture in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.', 'During the fiscal fourth quarter, the segment continued to witness strong growth, driven by continued market adoption of BD’s products. These trends are likely to have continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as well, thereby significantly pushing up the segmental revenues.', 'The Zacks Model estimates the BD Interventional revenues to be $1.16 billion, suggesting an uptick of 2.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.', 'In November 2023, BD launched the SiteRite 9 Ultrasound System. It is a new and advanced ultrasound system designed to help improve clinician efficiency when placing peripherally inserted central catheters, central venous catheters, IV lines and other vascular access devices. The same month, BD launched a new needle-free blood draw technology compatible with integrated catheters, the PIVO Pro Needle-free Blood Collection Device. These products are likely to have witnessed robust adoption in recent months, thereby driving up the Medical segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.', 'Continued strong growth in Pharmacy Automation (led by Parata and BD ROWA solutions), strength in Dispensing driven by BD Pyxis and strong demand for pre-fillable solutions for biologics such as BD Hypak and innovative products like BD Neopak are likely to have benefited the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.', 'However, the current unstable macroeconomic business environment, continued inflationary pressures, and labor dynamics are likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal first-quarter revenues, raising our apprehension.', 'For first-quarter fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.74 billion, implying an improvement of 3.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.', 'The consensus estimate for EPS is pegged at $2.39, indicating a decrease of 19.8% from the prior-year period’s reported number.', 'Per our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has higher chances of beating estimates.

(NYSE:GS) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.', ""Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ', ""Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Brian Lee, for US$3.6m worth of shares, at about US$376 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$381, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 28% of Brian Lee's holding."", ""In the last year Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

In total, insiders sold US$5.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain."", ""Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Goldman Sachs Group insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$620m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders."", ""Insiders sold Goldman Sachs Group shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Goldman Sachs Group and understanding these should be part of your investment process."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.', 'For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

It trades at just 14.7-times forward earnings, with metrics better than over 60% of industry peers. Additionally, the company’s 8% yield adds appeal to me as well.

Dollar General looks ready to run with its immense footprint poised to capture this resurgence.', 'In my view, the stock may take years to reach its former highs, but its growth prospects and momentum justify patience.

So, I remain bullish on this company long-term.', 'Source: Lutsenko_Oleksandr / Shutterstock.com', 'Despite high debt levels, JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) has delivered sensational growth. The China-based solar company faces global tariffs, yet revenue and earnings continue growing rapidly. While its balance sheet risk spooks some investors, low interest rates in China ease my concerns.', 'Trading at 2.4-times 2023’s estimated $12 in earnings per share and only 0.09-times sales against 32% top-line growth, JKS stock seems almost unbelievably undervalued. Its projected earnings growth trajectory looks outstanding, too, with earnings per share expected to reach $20 by 2027.', 'These valuations strike me as nonsensical for a fast-growing company operating in a critical global industry. JinkoSolar offers deep value and substantial growth potential, a rare combination I cannot ignore.

Trading at 0.44-times sales and 11-times 2024 earnings guidance (6-times 2027 projections), Newell looks deeply discounted at levels that seem to price in excessive pessimism over its future.', 'With analysts forecasting booming earnings growth in 2024 and beyond, alongside revitalized revenue growth, NWL stock has all the markings of an epic turnaround play in my eyes.

It not only beat estimates for the quarter, but management also projected higher growth than consensus estimates.', ""While reviewing the company's performance, I observed that management has prioritized stronger free cash in addition to growth while also noting robust demand among paid members. This leads me to believe Netflix's stock is undervalued at current levels."", ""Netflix was founded in the dot-com era as a DVD-by-mail service, allowing users to rent its DVDs online and have them mailed to them. Over the years, the company has gone through a few business transformations as preferences in the target market evolved. Its most well-known and successful transformation to date is turning the company into the most popular video streaming platform in the world by leveraging AWS's cloud infrastructure."", ""The company always prioritized an ad-free experience for paying members, but as costs for everyday products and services soared in the post-pandemic era, consumer demand for Netflix's streaming subscription fell precipitously, forcing it to offer subscription plans at cheaper prices with ads. The company also leveraged another opportunity with paid-sharing by allowing family members or friends to share their Netflix account with other family members or friends for a small fee. So far, these strategies seem to have worked for Netflix."", 'Since it is an app-based subscription-based business, metrics such as volume of paying members and average revenue per member are important metrics to review, in my opinion, to monitor the growth prospects of the business.', ""For the fourth quarter of 2023, Netflix beat revenue estimates by 1.3% at $8.8 billion. For the full year, the company's revenue trajectory reversed course back into growth mode, recording 11% year-over-year growth. But what was more interesting to me is that the company expects even stronger growth in 2024, projecting healthy double-digit revenue growth."", 'I believe a majority of the catalysts Netflix may be referring to as they project higher growth this year can be seen in the renewed durability of its subscriber numbers in the table below.', 'From the chart above, it is apparent the Europe, Middle East and Africa region has emerged as the top region for Netflix in terms of paid subscriber ads, growing at almost 16% on a year-over-year basis, twice as fast as the number of paid members being added from the U.S. and Canada and almost as fast as the fastest-growing region, Asia Pacifica and China, which is growing at 19% year over year. I believe much of the growth in the EMEA can be attributed to the sustained performance of Netflix\'s content, such as ""The Crown,"" which drove higher net-paid member additions to its streaming platform.', ""However, I suspect another factor that drove the surge in paid members is the password-sharing crackdown it initiated last year. While many studies have shown a mixed impact on Netflix's revenue, I believe on a net-net basis, this actually added about 15% incremental revenue to Netflix based on this study."", ""In terms of operational efficiency, I observe that Netflix's management has prioritized margin expansion this year, as seen from the chart below. Management has also been guided to sustain growth in profit margins over time."", ""Netflix also has a history of holding debt. As of the most recent quarter, the company had around $15 billion in debt. With around $7 billion in cash, Netflix's debt position may look risky. But the company has demonstrated its ability to manage its debt, as is consistent with most large, well-managed enterprises. It has been leaning on a pre-pandemic strategy of issuing high-yield bonds to fund the acquisition and production of content that drives its entire streaming platform. But in 2022, the company announced a move away from its indebted strategy and used its free cash to fund its content plans. In the recent quarter, Netflix pleasantly surprised me by posting roughly $7 billion in free cash, which is approximately four times more than the free cash it recorded in 2022. Moreover, management projected approximately $6 billion in free cash by the end of 2024. Although that will mark a slight deceleration in the growth of the free cash, I still see this as a positive development for Netflix's debt position."", ""In terms of valuation, I will assume consensus estimates of margins at 24%. Netflix is guiding for 26% margins in the first quarter of 2024, but I expect that to average out over the remaining three quarters of the year. Based on management's commentary, the ad-tier subscription is a high-margin business, but will only start to meaningfully impact the top and bottom lines from next year onwards. I see the ad-tier subscription as accretive to Netflix's bottom line since it is a high-margin segment. Therefore, I expect margins to grow to 26% over the next five years."", ""Now given that Netflix's operating income will grow at a CAGR of 13.3% over the next five years, which is higher than the 8% average growth in the S&P500, I find it reasonable to pay a premium of 29 times forward earnings. In this case, I expect room for upside from Netflix's current valuation levels."", 'Since Netflix is in the business of selling subscriptions to its streaming platform, I will view this as a consumer discretionary business. Most consumer discretionary businesses tend to be cyclical, as consumers alter their spending patterns based on economic cycles. One of those economic cycles was seen in 2022 as costs soared across the board, consumers cut discretionary spending and Netflix was at the receiving end with revenues declining. Although economists project the global economy will grow about 2.40% in 2024, I will expect the company to be impacted in the case of a surprise recession.', 'Netflix can also be impacted if it slows the roadmap of its content products. I noted earlier how global content launches had led to a sustained surge in paid members, specifically in the EMEA region. If Netflix is forced to slow down its content plans, it may impact the growth of net-paid members on its platform, which will eventually impact growth. Further, if the quality of content or content licensing worsens, paid members may cancel their subscriptions, causing revenue to decline.', ""Finally, streaming has become an extremely fragmented, hard-fought industry with multiple players, including Amazon Prime (NASDAQ:AMZN), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and others. Streaming platform differentiation is key here, and Netflix aims to differentiate its platform based on its strengths, which include prices and subscription tiers, content and product features. While the entire streaming industry is maturing and industry players are experimenting with different business formats, I find Netflix's strategy the most interesting. For the first time, the company announced in the earnings call, the size of its total addressable market at $600 billion, which today equals 5% penetration. Netflix's TAM has expanded beyond streaming and now includes Gaming, Connected TV and ad-tiers. Also, for the first time, management announced its ad business has been growing 70% sequentially this quarter. While these are very early days for Netflix's ad tier, I strongly feel the company is well-positioned to benefit from a robust ad-based streaming industry. Management also noted the progress it is making in building out ad-based partnership products and ad-measurement tools that eventually generate meaningful high-margin revenue contributions to Netflix's top line."", ""Netflix's recent quarter demonstrates the focus and ability of its management to deliver on long-term goals of prioritizing high-margin growth while growing free cash at the same time. The company's pivot away from its debt strategy is working while subscribers are returning to the platform. Given all of the recent developments, I see upside for Netflix."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Nielsen pointed out that NBCUniversal's Suits (CMCSA) garnered the most views of all time, with almost 60 billion total minutes watched in 2023. Questions now arise around whether it would be more incentivizing to license out older, but still popular content from media libraries or continue to create new content and hope for a hit."", 'Yahoo Finance Reporters Alexandra Canal, Josh Schafer, and Pras Subramanian help break down the latest report from Nielsen and what this could mean for streaming moving forward.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Josh, while you\'ve been looking at what people are betting on, I\'ve been taking a look at what people are watching.

And this is pretty staggering.', '""Suits"" acquiring the most views of all time, even surpassing ""The Office."" Almost 60 billion total minutes watched in 2023. That puts it just ahead of the 57.1 billion minutes of viewership that ""The Office"" acquired in 2020. And it just shows that you can really have TV series that were on years ago-- I mean, ""Suits"" debuted in 2011-- now getting this new life on platforms like Netflix.', ""And Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos, he has said multiple times that they want to continue licensing from competitors. He splashed cold water on the idea of wanting to license their own original content. We'll see if that changes down the line, because you could potentially be leaving a lot of money on the table. And I think that's something that at a certain point media companies across the board are going to have to weigh. Should we be licensing our content? Should we be keeping it in order to have more engagement? It's going to be a battle."", 'JOSH SCHAFER: To me, the biggest takeaway from this is, a, yes, how do you recreate ""Suits,"" but how do you not go fishing and say the wrong place for some of these shows, too, right? Like I think ""Suits"" has the right characteristics of something that works. It\'s kind of timeless, it\'s fun, it\'s light. It doesn\'t really-- I don\'t know, it\'s not a lot of the other shows that people are streaming right now. I think like we stream a lot of good dramas, right, and really intense kind of shows. And ""Suits"" for me, I was one of the people that streamed it on Netflix. And it was like just fun.', 'Like, it was just like a fun show. And it\'s like, how do you find shows like that?

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis and I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers. Tim, thanks for joining me."", 'Tim Beyers: Thanks, Dylan. Fully caffeinated. Ready to go.', ""Dylan Lewis: Love it. We've got to look at the entertainment world and big results and big reactions from company earnings and that's where we're going to kick things off with ASML. Tim, the linchpin of the chip industry in Europe's largest tech company, posted 9% bottom line growth and 30% top line growth for the quarter, sent shares up 10% this week after earnings seems like it's a pretty good time to be in the semiconductor business."", ""Tim Beyers: Well, let's not say that I wouldn't go that far, but I would say it's a better time and it does look like things are turning for the better. Let's just point out that ASML did have some really good results in the business that really will drive results for the longest period of time, which is the EUV business. This is the more advanced chip-making business. When we're talking about lithography, which is what ASML does, and they are the provider of EUV, which is the most advanced form of lithography for making the smallest and most advanced chips, we're talking about doing really advanced chip manufacturing here. In that part of the business, the EUV lithography was up 30% to 9.1 billion euro sold or I guess I should say recognized revenue on 53 systems, so a big deal. But they also shipped, and this is interesting, they shipped the first modules of what they call a high NA EUV system and they're shipping it to Intel. Watch out for the Intel results tomorrow."", ""This is going to be really interesting to see where we are at here because one of the rules of chip-making, Dylan, is that we are always looking for the next generation. We're always looking for how to make a more functional, smaller chip set. This looks like the next step. It's the step change that takes us into the next era of chip-making here. What does this mean for Intel's foundry plans? Hopefully, we find out more tomorrow. But the fact that this is happening, that at the highest levels, ASML is selling with a high degree of growth, its most advanced lithography machines is a very good sign. Now, on top of that, I would say somewhat lower tier, but the workman like chips that are made with DUV systems, those are greater than seven nanometers, so they're a little bit bigger. But it's the chipsets that you're going to find in industrial equipment. These are the workman like chips. They are everywhere. We have more of them in industrial equipment every single year. It's a better time to be in the chip-making business up and down the supply chain, which is nice to see. That wasn't really the case about 18 months ago."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned Intel's reporting, later this week. We'll have a fuller picture of the chip business and industry when they get results in. But we have results from Taiwan Semiconductor in addition to ASML and I want to put those two together and look at some of the different spots in the supply chain because we saw what looked like some strong outlook and expectations from Taiwan Semi when they reported, Taiwan Semi is ASML's biggest customer. We're seeing more moderate growth expectations in the commentary from ASML's management."", ""Tim Beyers: To me I just think that is prudence and I'm OK with that. I don't think it's a bad. What I think they're saying is we're seeing a recovery here, but we're going to be cautiously optimistic and that's ultimately a good thing here because we don't know what the long tailed demand of, let's say, really advanced hardware for AI workloads. We don't know how long that tail is. Do you want to be cautious, especially when you make a product that takes a long time to build and a long time to sell? Yes, I would like you to be cautious. That's a smart thing to be. In the case of Taiwan Semiconductor, so you have the way the supply chain works here, Dylan, you have the most advanced equipment and ASML does not sell very many of these because they are super expensive, these EUV machines. In order for Taiwan Semiconductor or any foundry provider, and a foundry is a chip-making factory, for them to order one of these machines, they need to have a really big backlog of orders that they need to have in place or the expectation of a really big backlog of orders that they need to be able to rely on in order to say like, we need these machines in order to satisfy that demand. There's a little bit of chicken and egg going on here but in this particular case before, ASML is going to invest a huge amount of R&D and a huge amount of manufacturing capacity to build a machine that costs just huge amounts of money, they need to be relatively assured that the demand is there and that the demand is not just, the next six months, the demand is multi year. I don't blame them for being prudent."", ""Dylan Lewis: Tim, we're going to stick with the earnings beat and look at some updated results from Netflix. On yesterday's show, our colleague Ricky Mulvey and Bill Mann, they discussed Netflix and they got into the $5 billion deal with WWE. The week of good news continues for the streamer shares up 10% following earnings, we saw some strong top line growth. We saw even stronger bottom line growth. But the headlines and everything I saw covering this earnings Tim, was the subscriber account. That seemed to be what everyone was zooming in on here."", ""Tim Beyers: It's understandable. It tripled year-over-year. Dylan, if we take a look at the overall number from Q4 of 2022, the number of global streaming paid editions, it didn't quite double. Paid net editions Q4 of 2022, 7.66 million, for Q4 of '23, 13.12 million. That's a huge number. That's not quite a double, but it is a massive increase, up 12.8% year-over-year. You can understand why that's an area of focus. I would caution that some of that is likely to be some maybe password cheaters coming into the fold and paying a little bit and you know what? There may be a little bit of an artificial bump there, but I don't mind that. They've tried to create a scenario whereby those who want Netflix and they want to get it and they have to pay a little bit, but not a lot, because previously they were sharing passwords. I think that gives them, I'm not going to say goodwill, it gives them a little incremental income and it satisfies somebody who's like, yeah, OK, you got me, I still want it but I'm not going to pay the full freight give me something that I can live with, they've got that and so now the net editions are rising as a result. I don't think that should be the headline number though, Dylan."", 'Dylan Lewis: What should it be?', 'Tim Beyers: Not at all.', 'Dylan Lewis: What should people be paying attention to?', ""Tim Beyers: It should be 26.2, 26.2 should be your number. Because that is the Q1 2024 forecast for operating margin. Let me just say that again, 26.2% is your forecast at operating margin for the next quarter. That is bonkers when so many of the streamers are having trouble even making $0.01 of profit, that Netflix can tell you that pre tax, we think we can make $0.26 on every dollar of streaming revenue in the first quarter. That is astounding. They are so far ahead of everybody else. Also, for their full year guidance for 2024, they raised their operating margin guidance for the full year to 24%, so they're going to get off to a great start in the first quarter, they're going to see presumably some dips here and there during the year but end on 24% that's astounding, Dylan, and they also ended the year with close to $7 billion in free cash flow. I can understand why this stock is soaring at present. This is by far the most efficient business in the streaming industry. Let's be clear, it ain't close. There is no one even remotely in the same ballpark as net. I will make that statement, no one is close, no one."", ""Dylan Lewis: Tim, the story with this company has been for a while, growth and then over the last couple of years we've had to moderate a little bit more and focus more on things like our margins and free cash flow, which also came in incredibly strong this quarter. It seems like this is something where the company is having its cake and eating it too with these results. We're seeing strong enough subscriber growth and we're seeing a lot of the efficiency elements that we want to be seeing with this business."", ""Tim Beyers: I think that's right. I also think it's a good study in effective capital allocation in entertainment. The two things, so Netflix is core advantage, which I think I've said to you before, Dylan, and something that they have that others do not have. Is they have a direct relationship with hundreds of millions of subscribers around the world. They are essentially a streaming TV service that has direct access to and control over subscriber accounts across the world in 190 countries, nobody else can do that, nobody else can claim that. The reason these streaming services came to be in the first place is to try to get that. The way the entertainment business has historically worked is you have the country that you're in and then you rely on distribution in other countries for local distributors and it's been really disaggregated that's the way the entertainment business has always worked. Netflix really disrupted that. As a consequence of that they get the ability to experiment with a lot of different types of content in each of those localities directly with their subscribers, make a lot of small bets with small amounts of capital and then allow a hit that may be something in like South Korea, Squid Game and it becomes a global phenomenon and so they get huge returns on a small amount of capital, I don't think we're seeing that in the other streaming businesses and it's one of the ways I can explain how good Netflix is at squeezing margin out of the same business, they entered the streaming entertainment business. They spend a lot, but on a lot of projects. When one hits it can have a really outsized impact on the business and they get huge economies of scale from that."", ""Dylan Lewis: Tim, that's going to wrap our earnings beat. While it might be earning season right now, Chipotle, not so focused on earnings season, more focused on burrito season."", ""Tim Beyers: It's burrito season, come on."", ""Dylan Lewis: News out that Chipotle is looking to hire 19,000 workers to meet the demands of peak burrito, which I didn't know is between March and May. When it comes to the job market most of the stories that we've been seeing have been about layoffs. Do you take this as a sign that Chipotle is expecting the good times to continue to roll?"", ""Tim Beyers: I have no idea but I know they're expecting to roll a lot of burritos and I know I want to see peak burrito T-shirts being sold at Chipotle, that's for sure. I think this is bonkers. It's really interesting that they are hiring as many people as they are and I think they do have an opportunity in particular to serve customers. As it gets warm, people get out, they like to just experience dining out again. Because when you are in the house during the winter and let's be clear. This has been, we've had some snowmageddon around the country, people have been hold up a bit and we've had some Arctic frost blowing across the country, I know we've had it here in Denver. I think we are looking forward to things warming up a little bit, maybe getting out and enjoying a burrito as well. Who knows if this is the good times continue to roll here. But Chipotle has been executing quite well. If they're looking to hire 19,000 employees here, it makes me, at worst, Dylan, it makes me really curious to see what the results are going to be in the next quarter here because clearly they have found something that they can hang their hat on so let's see it. Roll me some burritos, I love it."", ""Dylan Lewis: I will happily share a chipotle burrito with you out in Colorado if we ever get the chance to make that happen, Tim. In the meantime, I appreciate you jumping on today's show and walking through this with me."", 'Tim Beyers: Thanks, Dylan.', ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up, when's the last time you went out on a weeknight? A new stay at home trend is hitting some of the eatertainment companies and Motley Fool Money's, Ricky Mulvey caught up with Fool contributor Rick Munarriz to talk about one arcade company that's trying to reverse a sales decline."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Rick, I saw this article in the Wall Street Journal and I thought of you. The title is, Americans are Ditching Week Night Fun. Can hey be tempted back? First question, do you think this is concern trolling, or is this a legit problem for the we'll call them eatertainment companies like Dave & Buster's, Topgolf and Bowlero."", ""Rick Munarriz: I think in the near term, yes, it is a legit concern. The numbers are there. We're seeing some companies are sort of saying, hey, our business isn't as good as it was a year ago and it's a lot pointing to what's happening in the middle of the week. The longer answer is about can there be tempted back? Yes, I think that can happen, but I don't think it's going to happen immediately. But I think you see what's happening here. It makes sense when it all comes down together that in the pandemic, the pandemic was scary, it was awful, it was brutal. But it also was a time when a lot of us were stuck at home and we needed to get out. I don't know that situation because I've been basically contributing remotely to The Fool since 1995. I've been sheltering in place for almost 30 years. To me, this was something that when the pandemic came, it was awful, obviously."", ""But the fact that my wife and my kids were like, oh, we need something to do? I'm like, well, this is a Tuesday for me, this is typical, don't worry. In the old days when I was the only one working at home and everyone else on the planet was working in an office or going to school, I was like a little puppy when my wife would come back from work, when my kids would come back to school, where do we go? In a sense they were like, no, we're tired and you're sort of seeing the numbers you play out. You're seeing Roku, just to bring out a name. People are still streaming almost four hours of content. Even though now they have the ability to go out, they still want to go home and relax. We're seeing this happen. It's coming at the expense of all these fun places to go. Especially in the middle of the week when people are coming back home from work, they're tired, they may be pressed for cash, whether it's because they had student loans that now start to resume payments, or just that they're just trying to save money for whatever the case may be. In this climate of rising rates until recently, I do think that it is valid, it is a concern, but I think it is a near term concern."", ""Ricky Mulvey: The article focuses on what you said where people were working from home, now you're hybrid a couple of times a week so you're a little more tired, maybe your kids are going have more after school activities. The companies are busting out the weeknight promotions. David and Busters brought back all you can eat wings on Mondays and Thursdays. Topgolf is experimenting with some additional midweek discounts. They already do half off golf on Tuesdays. In Bowlero, the fancy bowling chain, offers unlimited late night bowling during the middle of the week, half priced arcade games on Wednesdays. I've been a big fan of going out during the week lightly because that's when you get some of the deals. While we're talking about these maybe anecdotal examples, it seems like these companies would constantly be monkeying with different promotions. Happy hour doesn't necessarily mean that people are spending less money. Do you think these promotions are signaling anything significant about these companies?"", ""Rick Munarriz: They get the data faster than we do as consumers. I think you get to the case where with Topgolf, once they started doing half off golf on Tuesdays, who is going to go to a Topgolf on a Monday or a Wednesday? Sure enough, they said Monday, Wednesday, Thursdays are now their worst days. They need to do something about that to get people back in there. Of course, it makes sense and we are at a time, thankfully for them, that it is very easy to reach your customers. You have loyalty programs like David and Busters have. You have the Internet, you have Instagram. You have all these outlets to reach to them. It's no longer having, oh, we need to cut a commercial spot. We need to have a radio ad. We need to talk the Groupon about getting a deal out there. These tools are there for them to change things on the fly. I think they have to think creatively at a time when it's no longer a cabin fever. Now it's like cabin desire, appreciation. I'm glad to be back at home. At the end of the day, I want to rest and relax and I think you're seeing that happen. Even Toast to bring in another company. They are the leader of payments on restaurants in the latest quarter and they said that transactions for revenue are trending lower in the holiday quarter. This is a company with 99,000 restaurants so it's a great sample size of what's happening out there that people are spending less, especially in the middle of the week."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's also, I think, a consumer debt story where you're seeing credit card balances go up higher. I'll focus on Dave and Buster's for a second because it's fighting off that post pandemic hangover. People are tired of going out. If you have a higher credit card balance, that's a pretty easy trip to cut if the kids are bored at home. Maybe we're not going to go to Dave and Buster's this week even if they have a great discount. But it's also, you could make the lipstick effect argument, which is that, hey, maybe we're not going to go to a professional sporting event that's too expensive, but we're going to meet you in the middle and go to something like David and Buster's, which might be a little bit cheaper for a week night activity. We'll start with the macro. What do you think of Dave and Buster's as a consumer spending indicator? Does it say anything?"", ""Rick Munarriz: I think it's fair. Again, I don't think this is the same as red lipsticks during the war time. This is more of an issue, Ricky, where if the economy is contracting, if you have more bills to pay, you're not going to trade down to a Dave and Buster's experience. I think it is the kind of thing where you will have a case, they will suffer. You've seen this happen at the restaurant level. You've seen this happen at Topgolf when they're not discounting at half price on Tuesdays in the middle of the week. People will cut back. I think it's understandable. I can't open up my Groupon app without a Bowlero ad deal showing. I do think that that is the kind of situation where it's legit. I don't think people are, it's not a matter of finding the middle ground. I do think that it's real and I think you're seeing. With David and Buster's, I think it's important as an investor, their latest quarter, their comps were down 6% and you see that and you think, oh, the business is declining. But it's still 8% above where it was in 2019, the last pre pandemic year so business has improved. It was just a bananas 2021 and 2022 and to a certain extent, the beginning of 2023 for Dave and Buster's and now that part is stabilizing. But as long as it's normalizing, their operating margins are 390% above, a basis points higher than it was in 2019. I think Dave and Buster's is definitely in a better place now than it was in 2019. I think it's just a matter of just building from this point now, which is a better baseline than it was last year."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think one of the issues for these companies, especially when you're doing those promotions, like you mentioned with Groupon and Bowlero is the longer you do that, the longer you set the expectation where someone's going to come in and get a deal. You've seen that happen to retailers in the past, where if your customers come in and nobody's expecting to pay full price, that becomes a problem 3, 5, 10 years down the road. We'll focus on David and Buster's, in part because I think if you want to teach anybody about Peter Lynch style investing, this isn't the worst place to get them interested in doing so. Chris Morris came in as CEO in 2022. We got a turnaround plan because every time a CEO comes in, you got to have a turnaround plan. In this case, there's basically three options. We got to go with three, Rick. One is remodeling the arcades. Number 2 is changing up the food and drink menu so you got more snackable options. Number 3 is growing the special events business. The market seems to be buying this story. You mentioned the pre pandemic comps and I know you follow this company. What do you think of his story for the Dave and Buster's turnaround?"", ""Rick Munarriz: Real quickly, Chris Morris, I know he's new to David and Buster's, but he's not new to this market. The reason he became CEO was in 2022, Dave and Buster'sbought a company called Main Event and Dave and Buster's have 160 locations. Main Event is much smaller, about 50 locations, but the same concept where it's quality, sit down dining and all these fun at arcade games and other, things you can entertain yourself with. He was a natural to come in and say, hey, we want you to be the new CEO. It's almost an Aqua Hire. They're also gaining new locations. Again, in Chris Morris's case, as he was the president of California Pizza Kitchen before that. He was even the CFO of CEC Entertainment, which is Chuck E. Cheese. If you always consider Dave and Buster's as a Chuck E. Cheese for adults, he was running the Dave and Buster's for kids already as a CFO, so he has that experience. I think it's the right approach, especially when you're dealing with entertainment and something you have to be vibrant. You can't stand still."", ""I think you're seeing this and just, in fact, remodeling that whole million dollar midway, which is such a big part of the experience. The fact that, again, I haven't been to Dave and Buster's in about two years, not for lack of love of the place, it's that the nearest one near me is no longer near me as I moved away. But it has always been a place where you can go and get a quality meal. But again, it is like the sit-down experience. The fact that they've trimmed down the menu so you can get more stuff all over the place is definitely something to look forward to. Special events, that was really hard for them to come around in 2020, 2021. People were dying to come back in, but businesses weren't ready to have functions, you weren't ready to have birthday parties and like anniversaries and all these other bachelor parties happening there anytime soon. That's a big part of the market and they tend to have these big rooms reserved for these special events too. I think that's going to be harder to come by if the economy goes south. But I think it's really the fact that he is tweaking things and business is better than it was in 2019, better than it was before he got there, I do think that he's on the right path."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I got a couple knocks on the business story. This continues the Peter Lynch theme. You've taken your kids to the arcade, they've played the life size Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots. They've done the racing games. Now it's time to talk about sale lease backs and share buybacks. Morris has aggressively been buying back shares. I think taking out about 18% of the existing share account in fiscal 2023. The business is profitable and yet he's doing some sale lease backs, which is where you sell your real estate to basically a real estate investment trust or a bank and then you're just leasing the building for forever. You get some immediate cash. You get that little sugar. But then you've got a long term debt problem, which I would give those as knocks against the business."", ""Rick Munarriz: I'm going to approach it a little differently. First of all, I look at the at a buyback as a great thing, even when your stock is hitting recent highs and doing really well as Dave and Buster's stock did in 2023. I do think that this is the company signaling, hey, we know our stock is high, but we think it's going to be even higher, that's why we're buying back now. Obviously from a company that's profitable as they are, the fact that you're buying back shares increases earnings per share rather than the money that they'd be earning off it.

It likely has the resources and proven capabilities that'll enable it to stick around, and remain profitable enough to pay off its shareholders for years and years."", ""While the cash payoffs might be initially smaller than you'd find with another type of equity, like a real estate investment trust (REIT), the upside is that the risks may be lower too. So with that in mind, let's evaluate Amgen to see if it's a smart choice for your dividend income portfolio right now."", ""Does Amgen have what it takes to be a stable source of cash flow? In a word, yes. Here's why."", 'Its product lineup features medicines that treat a range of different conditions with no clear theme, ranging from Prolia, for postmenopausal osteoporosis, to Mvasi, for various cancers. Sales of those drugs are how it generated trailing-12-month net income of $7.6 billion. Furthermore, this diverse product mix could be favorable, as it dramatically reduces the chance that a single new drug made by a competitor could harm multiple segments of its revenue at once.', ""Its late-stage pipeline is somewhat less eclectic, with a bevy of programs for inflammation and different indications in oncology representing the majority of its projects. Both inflammation and oncology are hot areas with an abundance of different niches, which means there's a high chance the business will be able to find a home for its new medicines even if the competition is fierce. And as much as we might wish otherwise, there will almost certainly be an ongoing demand for therapies in both of those segments, as neither inflammation nor cancer will be fully addressed anytime soon. That's another factor pointing to this stock having staying power."", ""At the moment, Amgen's forward dividend yield is 2.9%. That puts it well above the broader market's average dividend yield of 1.5%, but still a bit short of what one would consider to be a high-yield dividend stock."", ""But for long-term shareholders, the upside is likely to be significant. Over the last five years, Amgen hiked its quarterly dividend at an average annual rate of just over 10%, and it has an uninterrupted streak of raising its payment every year over the last 12 years. Plus, it only pays out around 59% of its earnings, so there's plenty of room for it to keep hiking its payout, even if net income falls somewhat. So the financial metrics look good, too."", ""As favorable as Amgen's future looks in the long term, be aware that it probably won't be an investment that makes you a millionaire overnight. It simply won't grow fast enough."", ""A key reason is that it only spends around 15.6% of its quarterly revenue on research and development (R&D), which worked out to be close to $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter. That's significantly lower as a proportion of sales than most of its big pharma peers. For instance, Eli Lilly spends 25.3% of its revenue on R&D; as a consequence, Lilly's pipeline is larger, featuring more programs at every stage of clinical trials, which gives it more chances to generate additional revenue by commercializing new medicines over time."", ""Nonetheless, that doesn't rule Amgen out as being a good dividend stock. At present, there are no major competitive or financial threats looming, and there's a high probability that Amgen will be able to keep developing and launching new medicines at an acceptable pace to maintain and expand its dividend. So if you're looking for a solid dividend investment that's ripe for holding a long while, this could well be it."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amgen right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amgen, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amgen wasn't one of them.

But you can see the reaction today, it really goes to what you guys were just talking about. That the response is probably going to be very tempered. And the bottom line is, oil prices are on their heels right now."", ""And it is all because of demand or lack of it, should we say. We do have OPEC coming out next week, which given everything that's going on, given the tensions in the Middle East, that could disrupt the marketplace. But I really don't think so. So to me as a trader, I actually love this extra volatility. And though much of the marketplace is looking at this as a buy the dip because of the escalated tensions out there, I actually look at this as selling what we call selling the rip or selling a move higher."", ""Because the overall macro picture of crude is absolutely on the bearish side. Obviously, things can escalate very quickly. You can always have a big pop, if God forbid, something really tragic happens here. So if you're trading, if you're trading with options or just with futures, you always need to use a star. But I would look to sell any pop that we get in the near term."", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: So, Ayham, in terms of the response that we tend to see from OPEC as we saw with the Russia Ukraine crisis in the Middle here, what response are you expecting from OPEC at the upcoming meeting?', ""AYHAM KAMEL: Well, I think Saudi Arabia, who really exactly is the engine of OPEC plus, will be looking at a very comfortable price range. I think for the Saudis, OPEC plus in general, any range of oil prices and the '80s is completely acceptable. There's not likely to be a big reaction to put additional barrels on the market in the current environment. One exception to that would be if we saw an escalation of the regional conflict and it begins to impact supplies."", ""Then the Saudis would consider to work more actively with OPEC plus to try to create some form of relief over there. But currently, given just the demand picture that we've discussed on the show and the supply risks as they are, the Saudis will be cautious in terms of putting additional. Or taking barrels or putting additional barrels on the market sale stable status quo works for now, particularly given the spending commitments on Vision 2030."", 'And I think that the Saudis can deliver on that. One key point I would just add, that things-- yes, there is an intention by the Biden administration to calibrate its response. But military conflicts and regional crises have the tendency to create their own dynamics. Where we are today is not a very comfortable place in terms of risks in general. I do expect additional tit for tat military strikes and confrontation between the US and the militias in Iraq and Syria. This is not going to be a comfortable couple of weeks at all.']"

Rick, what do we know so far?"", ""RICK NEWMAN: Well, this crosses a so-called red line regarding US involvement in everything happening in the Middle East because we now have American service members who have been killed and others injured by what appears to be a strike emanating from Iran or with Iran's backing.

But over shorter periods, Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), has proved unpredictable."", ""In successive years since this decade began, the S&P 500 has bounced between bear and bull markets. Although some investors define a bull market as one which has rallied at least 20% from a recent low, there's little question that a new bull market has emerged when a major stock index reaches a new all-time high. With the S&P 500 recently taking out its previous high, we can proclaim without a shadow of a doubt that we're in a bull market (which actually began more than 15 months ago)."", 'While a major stock index hitting a new high might turn some value-seeking investors off, rest assured that bargains can still be found. This holds true for younger investors seeking to put their money to work in game-changing businesses, as well as retirees who value capital preservation, but also still want to grow their nest egg.', 'What follows are three perfect stocks retirees can confidently buy hand over fist in the new bull market.', 'The first genius stock that retirees can fearlessly add to their portfolios is world-leading payment processor Visa (NYSE: V).', ""Every single publicly traded company has potential headwinds. For Visa, the biggest concern is that it's cyclical. If the U.S. or global economy fall into a recession, the expectation would be for consumer and enterprise spending to taper. Less spending and fewer transactions would be a recipe for weaker growth or possibly even revenue contraction for Visa and its peers."", ""But here's the thing: Recessions are disproportionately short-lived events. There have been a dozen recessions since the end of World War II, and only three have managed to endure 12 months. Of the remaining three, none lasted longer than 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of expansion stick around for multiple years, with a couple reaching the decade mark. Aggregate consumer and enterprise spending are pushing higher over long periods, which is a seemingly foolproof investment thesis in favor of Visa."", ""It also doesn't hurt that Visa's management team has kept the company focused on payment processing and avoided the temptations of lending. Though I have little doubt that Visa would succeed as a lender and generate plenty of interest income, it would also expose the company to loan losses and credit delinquencies during recessions. Sticking to its bread-and-butter maximizes Visa's financial flexibility and minimizes any pain felt during economic downturns."", ""Additionally, you're getting the undisputed leader in payment facilitation when you buy Visa stock. According to Nilson Report, Visa accounted for nearly 42% of credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. in 2022. The U.S. is the largest market for consumption globally."", 'Furthermore, Visa has a multidecade growth runway in underbanked emerging markets, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. It has more than enough capital and operating cash flow to organically expand into these markets, or can make acquisitions to rapidly broaden its reach, as it did in 2016 when it purchased Visa Europe.', 'Visa offers retirees the ability to enjoy sustained double-digit growth potential, yet its stock is 5% less-volatile than the benchmark S&P 500.', 'A second stock that\'s ideal for retirees to buy hand over fist in the new bull market is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is better known by its shorthand, ""J&J.""', ""Whereas the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are thriving in bull markets, J&J has lagged these respective indexes. The reason? Johnson & Johnson is facing up to 100,000 lawsuits over its now-discontinued talc-based baby powder that allege it causes cancer. In addition to settling a $700 million investigation into its baby powder by more than 40 states, it's had two settlement attempts (the latest offered $8.9 billion to settle the aforementioned 100,000 lawsuits) thrown out in court. Wall Street doesn't like unknowns, and there's no certainty as to when this litigation will have a resolution."", ""The solace for current and prospective J&J investors is that there may not be a more operationally sound company on the planet. It's one of only two publicly traded companies that currently holds the coveted AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more-familiar S&P Global. The highest credit rating possible signals that S&P expects J&J to be able to service its outstanding debt and liabilities with ease."", ""What's really been powering Johnson & Johnson's success is its focus on pharmaceuticals. For more than a decade, management has increased the company's reliance on brand-name drugs. Even though novel therapies have finite periods of patent exclusivity, they generate juicy margins and afford J&J strong pricing power. Since Johnson & Johnson is bringing in a mountain of operating cash flow each year, it's been able to aggressively reinvest in novel research, as well as forge collaborations to avoid patent-cliff issues."", ""Another reason J&J has been such a superstar investment for decades is the continuity it's seen in key leadership positions. You only need two hands to count how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding 138 years ago. No carousel at the top means consistency in the bottom line."", ""I'll also add that healthcare is an exceptionally defensive sector. People don't stop needing prescription medicine and medical devices just because the U.S. or global economy has weakened."", ""With Johnson & Johnson, retirees are getting a company that's only 53% as volatile as the S&P 500, yet yields 3% and has increased its base annual payout for 61 consecutive years."", 'The third perfect stock retirees can buy hand over fist in the new bull market is telecom stock AT&T (NYSE: T).', ""Similar to J&J, AT&T struggled in 2023 while the major indexes galloped to double-digit gains. AT&T's issues can be traced to rapidly rising interest rates, which threaten to make debt refinancing costlier, and a Wall Street Journal report from July that alleged lead-sheathed cable use by legacy telecom companies could lead to pricey replacement and environmental costs. While these are genuine issues that shouldn't be ignored, they've also been overblown."", ""For instance, AT&T has noted that only a small percentage of its network utilizes lead-clad cables. Further, it's not found any environmental/health hazards associated with lead-sheathed cables still in use. If there is any financial liability to be had for AT&T, it would almost certainly be determined in the U.S. court system, which would probably take years. In other words, the lead-sheathed cable issue isn't a near-term concern for AT&T."", ""As for concerns about higher interest rates, investors need only look at AT&T's balance sheet for signs of comfort. When AT&T spun out content arm WarnerMedia in April 2022, which was subsequently merged with Discovery to create new media entity Warner Bros. Discovery, the new company took responsibility for certain lots of debt previously held by AT&T. All told, AT&T received $40.4 billion in concessions (including cash payments). Inclusive of organic pay-down, AT&T's net debt has fallen from $169 billion to just a shade below $129 billion in under two years. It's in considerably better financial shape than it was in 2022."", ""On top of an improved balance sheet, AT&T's operating performance is benefiting from the 5G revolution. Faster download speeds have encouraged users to consume more data. Data just happens to be the primary margin driver for AT&T's wireless segment."", ""Last year also marked the sixth consecutive year that AT&T added at least 1 million net broadband users. Even though broadband isn't the growth driver it was two decades ago, it's the perfect dangling carrot to encourage service bundling, which ultimately boosts margins and cash flow for the company."", ""Retirees who buy AT&T stock are getting an inexpensive (8X forward-year earnings) and time-tested company that's 28% less-volatile than the S&P 500 and doling out a yield in excess of 6%."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

A reading above 50 represents an expansion in the manufacturing and services sectors.

Prosper Trading Academy CEO Scott Bauer and Eurasia Group Middle East Practice Head Ayham Kamel analyze the potential fallout on Yahoo Finance Live. Kamel warns, ""This is not going to be a comfortable few weeks at all.""', 'Kamel believes the attack\'s near-term impact on oil supply will be limited, saying it\'s ""contained"". However, he expects the Biden administration will likely undertake some military response targeting militias in Iraq and Syria. Broader action on Iran seems unlikely, with Kamel citing ""reluctance"" to stoke inflation and considerations around ""Biden\'s own position domestically."" He believes Biden will aim to ""be careful"" and restrict long-term escalation.', 'Meanwhile, Bauer asserts ""the bottom line is oil prices are on their heels right now"" amid weak demand. Though geopolitical tensions could move prices, the impact appears muted as risks are already priced in. Bauer sees crude oil in a ""bearish"" macro position and is enthusiastic about the current volatility for traders, suggesting investors look to sell.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: Joining us now we have Scott Bauer, Prosper Trading Academy CEO, and Ayham Kamel, Eurasia Group Middle East Practice head. So I want to have you first set the scene here in terms of what this means in terms of oil supply and demand now that we see that this is escalating.', ""AYHAM KAMEL: I think in the first instance, there will be no impact-- direct impact on oil supply in the region. I think more likely than not, the Biden administration is creating a calibrated military response that appears very loud in terms of targeting militias in Iraq and Syria to rebuild that lost US deterrence on the military front. But I think the appetite to move into something direct that hits Iran or hits Iranian export, it's still low for now."", ""So I think there's reluctance to do something in terms of tinkering with oil supplies that might impact inflation expectations, and over the long term, even Biden's own position domestically. So more likely than not, we're looking at a contained conflict with a higher risk that it expands. For now, the Biden administration is probably going to be careful."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: Scott, let me get your reaction to what Adam said. I mean, do you agree that potential disruption to oil markets pretty much contained there and that the broader concern as it relates to the energy space really is about the demand picture, largely coming out of China too?', ""SCOTT BAUER: No doubt about it, and I wholeheartedly agree. I do think even now with oil prices down today, there's probably about $3 to $4 of risk premium already built in because of tensions in the Middle East, especially with what happened over the weekend. But you can see the reaction today, it really goes to what you guys were just talking about. That the response is probably going to be very tempered. And the bottom line is, oil prices are on their heels right now."", ""And it is all because of demand or lack of it, should we say. We do have OPEC coming out next week, which given everything that's going on, given the tensions in the Middle East, that could disrupt the marketplace. But I really don't think so. So to me as a trader, I actually love this extra volatility. And though much of the marketplace is looking at this as a buy the dip because of the escalated tensions out there, I actually look at this as selling what we call selling the rip or selling a move higher."", ""Because the overall macro picture of crude is absolutely on the bearish side. Obviously, things can escalate very quickly. You can always have a big pop, if God forbid, something really tragic happens here. So if you're trading, if you're trading with options or just with futures, you always need to use a star. But I would look to sell any pop that we get in the near term."", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: So, Ayham, in terms of the response that we tend to see from OPEC as we saw with the Russia Ukraine crisis in the Middle here, what response are you expecting from OPEC at the upcoming meeting?', ""AYHAM KAMEL: Well, I think Saudi Arabia, who really exactly is the engine of OPEC plus, will be looking at a very comfortable price range. I think for the Saudis, OPEC plus in general, any range of oil prices and the '80s is completely acceptable. There's not likely to be a big reaction to put additional barrels on the market in the current environment. One exception to that would be if we saw an escalation of the regional conflict and it begins to impact supplies."", ""Then the Saudis would consider to work more actively with OPEC plus to try to create some form of relief over there. But currently, given just the demand picture that we've discussed on the show and the supply risks as they are, the Saudis will be cautious in terms of putting additional. Or taking barrels or putting additional barrels on the market sale stable status quo works for now, particularly given the spending commitments on Vision 2030."", 'And I think that the Saudis can deliver on that. One key point I would just add, that things-- yes, there is an intention by the Biden administration to calibrate its response. But military conflicts and regional crises have the tendency to create their own dynamics. Where we are today is not a very comfortable place in terms of risks in general. I do expect additional tit for tat military strikes and confrontation between the US and the militias in Iraq and Syria. This is not going to be a comfortable couple of weeks at all.']"

Big tech companies spent heavily on software development and specific chips from companies like Nvidia to train their AI models. As a result, investors saw a few select chipmakers emerge as big winners as demand from deep-pocketed tech innovators drove sales significantly higher.', ""But the next class of AI winners won't be the companies producing chips to train AI models; it'll be the companies producing chips that use those AI models to produce responses to prompts. Demand for these so-called inference chips will increase as more people demand the ability to use AI on their devices instead of sending data to a server and waiting for a response. Analysts at UBS see inference chips moving from 10% of all AI chips sold in 2023 to 20% by 2025 and $30 billion in total revenue within five to 10 years."", ""On-device AI is essential for applications that require low latency and reliability (like autonomous vehicles) or where you can't compromise on data security and privacy (like medical or government records). As demand for on-device AI increases, several companies stand to benefit."", 'Here are three that could be surprise AI winners in 2024.', 'Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon told analysts in November: ""We expect high-performance on-device AI to become a requirement over the next few years."" And he sees Qualcomm as a leading beneficiary of that trend as it drives demand for more powerful chips and could expand to new device categories.', ""Qualcomm is working closely with leading AI models from Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Baidu to ensure its Snapdragon smartphone chip designs can generate responses faster and more power-efficiently than competing chipmakers'. Meanwhile, it sees opportunities to take share in PCs while helping bring the headset-computer format (virtual or augmented reality) to a broader audience. It also plays a key role in automotive computing."", ""In the meantime, Qualcomm has a very strong position in the smartphone industry already. Its modem designs are ubiquitous, and its mobile chips are featured in many high-end Android devices. While Qualcomm will lose Apple's licensing business at some point in the near future when it shifts to its own modem designs, it should be able to recover quickly as its position with most Android handset makers is secure and it expands into new device categories."", ""As demand for power-efficient, high-end chips capable of on-device AI inference grows, more and more device makers will turn to the higher-end chips Qualcomm makes. With shares trading at just 15 times analysts' estimates for this year's earnings, the stock appears fairly priced considering it should be able to produce steady revenue growth from its core business with high upside as on-device AI inference takes off."", 'MediaTek (TWSE: 2454) is Asia\'s largest chip-design house. Its biggest focus has been multimedia and wireless technologies, but it\'s expanded to mobile devices and Internet-of-Things products. Last August, the company signed a deal with Meta to build a ""complete edge computing ecosystem designed to accelerate AI application development on smartphones, IoT, vehicles, smart home, and other edge devices.""', ""The big push by MediaTek into smartphones and AI chips represents a major threat to Qualcomm, and the Taiwanese company's already made some major wins over the bigger chip designer. Meta chose MediaTek to power its augmented reality glasses in November."", ""The new Dimensity 9300 chip design is positioned to compete directly with Qualcomm's highest-end chip, which could help MediaTek expand its presence into more flagship devices."", 'More promising, however, is the Dimensity 8300, which is designed for midrange smartphones. As the first midrange smartphone chip designed for on-device generative AI, it could come to dominate an increasingly important market.', 'With shares trading at just 16 times 2024 earnings estimates, the stock appears to be trading at a great value considering the potential growth from its push into high-end smartphones and cementing its position in midrange devices.', ""That said, investors will have to buy shares of MediaTek stock on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, since that's the only place its shares trade. That requires a broker that supports foreign stock trades as well as the ability to stomach fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. On top of that, your broker may charge extra fees for accessing a foreign exchange."", 'As with any investment in a foreign company, whether it has American depositary receipts (ADR) on a U.S. exchange or trades on a local exchange, there are geopolitical and regulatory risks involved. For example, investing in MediaTek, or any Taiwanese company, is subject to the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait between Taiwan and China, or just the perception of that risk (even if the actual risk is low). As such, this is a riskier play on the future of AI and requires investors to keep their eyes on things. Investors with a higher risk tolerance might consider it, but more risk-averse investors might consider the other potential surprise AI winners discussed here.', ""Apple isn't exactly a big name in generative AI, but that doesn't mean it won't stand to benefit from booming demand for on-device AI inferences. Apple is a leading proponent of data security. It wants to help you keep your personal information on your personal device instead of sending it to a server, and it's making the chips that make it possible to keep everything on its devices while running some of the most advanced AI algorithms built."", 'Apple builds some of the most advanced smartphone processors on the market for its iPhones. It has a strong relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to get its hands on the most powerful and power-efficient chip processes available on the market. And its vertically integrated approach puts it in a position to become the only smartphone maker that can offer some of the most advanced AI technologies on its devices.

Its shares have trailed the market in recent quarters, with the stock down 6% in the last 12 months, while stocks like the ""Magnificent Seven"" have soared.', ""Lockheed Martin's Q4 earnings brought more of the same. Even though the company posted analyst-beating earnings and revenue for 2023, the stock fell around 5% the day after it reported its results, which included disappointing financial guidance for 2024."", 'Investors have soured on Lockheed Martin stock for 2024. Does that make now a perfect time for long-term investors to start a position in the stock?', ""Investors love businesses with high predictability. Lockheed Martin's fighter jet and aeronautics division is one of the most predictable in the world. The company signs long-term contracts for jets with the U.S. government and its allies that can run for decades. For example, the current F-35 delivery contract with the U.S. Department of Defense runs through 2044, with maintenance costs recurring long thereafter."", ""Luckily for investors, the aeronautics division is also highly profitable. In 2023, it generated an operating profit of $2.8 billion, or 33% of Lockheed Martin's consolidated profits. With durable contracts and minimal competition, investors should expect consistent and steadily growing earnings from this division year after year."", 'Lockheed is more than just fighter jets, though. It has missiles, rotary systems (i.e., helicopters), and space divisions that help diversify its operations. All three of these divisions generated more than $1 billion in operating earnings last year.', 'Overall, Lockheed Martin generated $8.5 billion in operating earnings and $6.2 billion in free cash flow. In 2024, it is guiding for $6 billion to $6.3 billion in free cash flow generation.', ""With war activity rising around the world, countries are turning to Lockheed to fortify their defenses. For example, just this week, Israel signed a deal with the company to supply the country with 25 F-35 fighters. It is no surprise then to see Lockheed Martin's backlog hit a record $160.6 billion at the end of 2023."", 'On top of steady contracts from existing technology, Lockheed is well-known for being one of the most forward-looking and advanced defense research institutions in the world. For reference, it spent $1.5 billion just on research and development in 2023.', 'This has led to some recent breakthroughs. Perhaps most important is the unveiling of the X-59 aircraft from its Skunk Works Division. It is not commercially ready yet, but the X-59 promises a supersonic aircraft -- meaning flying faster than the speed of sound -- without a sonic boom.', 'This may not seem important, but there is a ban on commercial supersonic flight over land right now due to sonic boom disturbances. Eliminating the sonic boom could open up a new era of flight for Lockheed Martin and any other company looking to license its technology. That sounds pretty valuable to me.', 'There is also the Next Generation Air Dominance platform, otherwise known as NGAD. This is a sixth-generation fighter for the Department of Defense, and Lockheed Martin is the front-runner to win the contract. Its only competition right now is Boeing, but given the quality control issues it is having at the moment, it seems likely that Lockheed Martin will win the deal. This would set up Lockheed for more lengthy fighter jet contracts with the U.S. government and its allies.', 'From a business perspective, these technological breakthroughs are the main reason the U.S. government will choose Lockheed Martin for contracts. More contracts mean more revenue and profits, which is what shareholders are looking for at the end of the day.', 'Lockheed Martin is in a defensible (pun intended) position as one of the dominant U.S. defense contractors. But on top of this, it has a management team that consistently rewards shareholders through its capital returns program. Just in 2023, it spent $9 billion on dividends and share buybacks. It currently has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 15.5, well below the S&P 500 average of 26.5.', ""At a market capitalization of approximately $100 billion, Lockheed Martin can provide solid total returns to investors over the long haul if it keeps up these buybacks and dividend payments. The stock's dividend per share has grown by 145% in the last 10 years, while its shares outstanding have fallen by 25%. Management has guided for these trends to continue in the coming years."", ""Combine these consistent capital returns with the high predictability of Lockheed Martin's defense contracts, and I think the stock can be a winner for those who hold for the long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lockheed Martin wasn't one of them.

Fourth quarter SG&A expense was $308 million, or 7.4% of home sale revenues, compared with $351 million, or 7.1%, in the prior year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'Investors widely favor dividend-paying stocks, irrespective of the frequency at which dividends are distributed. While a majority of companies adhere to a quarterly dividend distribution schedule to provide returns to shareholders, there are variations in payout frequency. Some companies opt for a monthly dividend distribution, offering investors more regular income streams, while others choose an annual payout structure. The appeal of dividend-paying stocks lies in the steady income they provide, making them attractive to a diverse range of investors seeking a reliable source of returns from their investments.', 'The frequency of dividend payments is not a determining factor in the attractiveness of these stocks, as they have consistently delivered robust returns over the years. A report by Hartford Funds highlighted that from 1930 to 2022, the contribution of dividend income to the total return of the S&P 500 Index averaged 41%. Apart from their substantial contribution to the overall market return, dividends are attractive to investors due to their yields. However, the common mistake among investors seeking dividend-paying investments is to solely focus on those offering the highest yields. A study conducted by Wellington Management sheds light on the potential pitfalls of this approach.', ""Wellington Management analyzed by categorizing dividend-paying stocks into quintiles based on their dividend payouts. The top 20%, labeled as the first quintile, comprised the highest dividend payers, while the bottom 20%, the fifth quintile, consisted of the lowest dividend payers. Surprisingly, the study found that second-quintile stocks outperformed the S&P 500 Index in eight out of the 10 time periods spanning from 1930 to 2022. The first- and third-quintile stocks tied for second place, collectively beating the Index 67% of the time. On the contrary, fourth- and fifth-quintile stocks consistently lagged behind by a significant margin. The superior performance of second-quintile dividend-paying stocks can be attributed to the fact that the excessive dividend payouts of first-quintile stocks haven't always proven to be sustainable over time. This highlights the importance of a more nuanced approach when selecting dividend-paying investments, considering factors beyond just the immediate yield."", 'In this context, it is more sensible to consider companies that consistently raise their dividends. Dividend growth, especially when coupled with robust balance sheets and substantial yields, can offer investors a reliable source of income, act as a buffer against market downturns, and potentially contribute to the healthy growth of investments. According to a report from Guardian Capital citing data from Goldman Sachs, from 1970 to 2021, companies that are consistent dividend growers and payers have demonstrated better performance compared to non-dividend payers and those that have reduced dividends, especially during periods characterized by high inflation and rising interest rates.', 'While major companies such as The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) pay dividends on a quarterly basis, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks that offer annual dividends.', 'Photo by Dan Dennis on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', ""For this list, we selected dividend companies that pay dividends just once a year to shareholders. Most of these companies are traded on American exchanges, however, some foreign companies on our list are traded on the OTC market. The listed companies below have been selected based on their dividend frequency, indicating that they may pay dividends less frequently. Consequently, it's important to note that their dividend yields could be comparatively lower. We measured hedge fund sentiment around American stocks based on Insider Monkey's database for Q2 2023. The stocks are ranked from the lowest dividend yield to the highest, as of January 30.

Depending on your goals, investment risk tolerance, and interests, there's almost certainly a strategy that can make you richer over time."", ""However, the caveat to the above is that it's tough to top the long-term outperformance of dividend stocks."", 'Last year, a report released by the Hartford Funds (""The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future""), in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, examined the annualized returns of dividend-paying stocks to non-payers over a half-century (1973-2022). Whereas non-payers delivered a modest 3.95% annualized return over five decades, dividend stocks averaged an annualized return of 9.18% over the same stretch. The dividend payers were also far less volatile than the non-payers.', ""But there's more to a high-quality dividend stock than just yield. Arguably nothing is more important than the sustainability of a payout, which is often not found with ultra-high-yielding dividend stocks."", 'Some of the greatest dividend stocks on Earth are brand-name, time-tested companies that have been increasing their payouts for decades. Perfect examples include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), which have each increased their base annual payouts for 61 consecutive years.', ""Johnson & Johnson happens to be one of only two publicly traded companies that currently has the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of the more-familiar S&P Global. A growing reliance on high-margin pharmaceuticals, coupled with operating in a highly defensive sector, have helped Johnson & Johnson grow its adjusted earnings without missing a beat for decades. As a result, it's had no trouble sharing more of its profits with its investors."", 'Meanwhile, Coca-Cola has been the most-chosen brand, according to Kantar\'s ""Brand Footprint"" report, every year for a decade (as of 2022). Coke operates in all but three countries worldwide, has a top-tier marketing campaign, and sells basic necessity goods. No matter how well or poorly the domestic or global economy is performing, people are still going to buy beverages, which makes Coca-Cola\'s cash flow highly predictable.', 'Another way to measure dividend greatness is by examining the length of time a company has been offering a continuous payout. Just over a dozen publicly traded companies have been doling out continuous dividends since the 19th century.', 'For example, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM)(long before it was called ""ExxonMobil"") has been paying a consecutive dividend since 1882. A steadily growing global population is demanding more in the way of energy commodities, which is a boon to its upstream drilling segment.', ""Further, ExxonMobil has a tight lid on its cost structure, with the company aiming to eliminate $15 billion in operating expenses between 2019 and the end of 2027. With macro factors working in the company's favor, above-average oil prices provide plenty of impetus for ExxonMobil to continue doling out a market-topping payout."", ""Power tools company Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) is no slouch, either. It's coming up on the 150-year mark since it first began paying a consecutive dividend (since 1876). Though power tools may not be viewed in the same necessity class as food, beverages, and energy commodities, Stanley Black & Decker's operating performance ebbs and flows in lockstep with the U.S. and global economy. Since recessions are short-lived, the company is often thriving and able to share a percentage of its profits with its shareholders."", ""But truth be told, none of these brand-name businesses come close to the consistency of one small-cap water utility stock that I can virtually guarantee 99% of investors have probably never heard of before. I'm talking about water and wastewater services provider York Water (NASDAQ: YORW)."", 'York Water is a water utility valued at $510 million that provides its services to 54 municipalities in three counties in South-Central Pennsylvania. It also averages fewer than 48,000 shares traded daily on the Nasdaq exchange, demonstrating how under-the-radar it remains.', 'Despite its diminutive size, it offers something that no other dividend stock does: a consecutive dividend streak that spans more than 200 years.', 'On Jan. 16, 2024, York Water made history, once again, by issuing a dividend payment to its shareholders. This marked the 208th consecutive year that York has paid its investors, which is 60 years longer than Stanley Black & Decker, the next-closest company based on consecutive dividend payments.', ""One of the reasons York is so special is because it provides a basic need service. Regardless of whether you own or rent a home, it's a veritable certainty you'll need water and wastewater services. To add, most utilities operate as monopolies or duopolies in the areas they serve. This equates to highly predictable operating cash flow in year in and year out for the company."", 'York\'s predictability is also a function of it being a regulated utility. ""Regulated"" utilities require permission from state public utility commissions -- in York\'s case, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) -- before rate hikes can be passed along to customers. Though this might sound like a nuisance, it ensures the company won\'t have to face unpredictable wholesale rates.', ""Further, it's worth noting that the PPUC gave York Water the OK in January 2023 to increase its rates on 75,000 customers to account for $176 million in ongoing and future infrastructure investments. This rate hike was expected to lift York's annual revenue by approximately 22% last year. These rate hikes, along with a steady diet of bolt-on acquisitions, have the profit needle pointing higher."", 'While some investors are going to suggest York\'s 2.4% yield is too modest to be ""Wall Street\'s Greatest Dividend Stock,"" I\'d suggest those folks take a closer look at York\'s total return, including dividends, over the trailing 25 years. York\'s 1,030% total return has almost precisely doubled-up the total return of the benchmark S&P 500. Thus, the only reason York is yielding a modest 2.4% is because its stock has vastly outperformed the broader market.', 'Among dividend-paying stocks, York Water is unsurpassed.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in York Water right now?', 'Before you buy stock in York Water, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and York Water wasn't one of them.

But over shorter periods, Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), has proved unpredictable."", ""In successive years since this decade began, the S&P 500 has bounced between bear and bull markets. Although some investors define a bull market as one which has rallied at least 20% from a recent low, there's little question that a new bull market has emerged when a major stock index reaches a new all-time high. With the S&P 500 recently taking out its previous high, we can proclaim without a shadow of a doubt that we're in a bull market (which actually began more than 15 months ago)."", 'While a major stock index hitting a new high might turn some value-seeking investors off, rest assured that bargains can still be found. This holds true for younger investors seeking to put their money to work in game-changing businesses, as well as retirees who value capital preservation, but also still want to grow their nest egg.', 'What follows are three perfect stocks retirees can confidently buy hand over fist in the new bull market.', 'The first genius stock that retirees can fearlessly add to their portfolios is world-leading payment processor Visa (NYSE: V).', ""Every single publicly traded company has potential headwinds. For Visa, the biggest concern is that it's cyclical. If the U.S. or global economy fall into a recession, the expectation would be for consumer and enterprise spending to taper. Less spending and fewer transactions would be a recipe for weaker growth or possibly even revenue contraction for Visa and its peers."", ""But here's the thing: Recessions are disproportionately short-lived events. There have been a dozen recessions since the end of World War II, and only three have managed to endure 12 months. Of the remaining three, none lasted longer than 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of expansion stick around for multiple years, with a couple reaching the decade mark. Aggregate consumer and enterprise spending are pushing higher over long periods, which is a seemingly foolproof investment thesis in favor of Visa."", ""It also doesn't hurt that Visa's management team has kept the company focused on payment processing and avoided the temptations of lending. Though I have little doubt that Visa would succeed as a lender and generate plenty of interest income, it would also expose the company to loan losses and credit delinquencies during recessions. Sticking to its bread-and-butter maximizes Visa's financial flexibility and minimizes any pain felt during economic downturns."", ""Additionally, you're getting the undisputed leader in payment facilitation when you buy Visa stock. According to Nilson Report, Visa accounted for nearly 42% of credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. in 2022. The U.S. is the largest market for consumption globally."", 'Furthermore, Visa has a multidecade growth runway in underbanked emerging markets, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. It has more than enough capital and operating cash flow to organically expand into these markets, or can make acquisitions to rapidly broaden its reach, as it did in 2016 when it purchased Visa Europe.', 'Visa offers retirees the ability to enjoy sustained double-digit growth potential, yet its stock is 5% less-volatile than the benchmark S&P 500.', 'A second stock that\'s ideal for retirees to buy hand over fist in the new bull market is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is better known by its shorthand, ""J&J.""', ""Whereas the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are thriving in bull markets, J&J has lagged these respective indexes. The reason? Johnson & Johnson is facing up to 100,000 lawsuits over its now-discontinued talc-based baby powder that allege it causes cancer. In addition to settling a $700 million investigation into its baby powder by more than 40 states, it's had two settlement attempts (the latest offered $8.9 billion to settle the aforementioned 100,000 lawsuits) thrown out in court. Wall Street doesn't like unknowns, and there's no certainty as to when this litigation will have a resolution."", ""The solace for current and prospective J&J investors is that there may not be a more operationally sound company on the planet. It's one of only two publicly traded companies that currently holds the coveted AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more-familiar S&P Global. The highest credit rating possible signals that S&P expects J&J to be able to service its outstanding debt and liabilities with ease."", ""What's really been powering Johnson & Johnson's success is its focus on pharmaceuticals. For more than a decade, management has increased the company's reliance on brand-name drugs. Even though novel therapies have finite periods of patent exclusivity, they generate juicy margins and afford J&J strong pricing power. Since Johnson & Johnson is bringing in a mountain of operating cash flow each year, it's been able to aggressively reinvest in novel research, as well as forge collaborations to avoid patent-cliff issues."", ""Another reason J&J has been such a superstar investment for decades is the continuity it's seen in key leadership positions. You only need two hands to count how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding 138 years ago. No carousel at the top means consistency in the bottom line."", ""I'll also add that healthcare is an exceptionally defensive sector. People don't stop needing prescription medicine and medical devices just because the U.S. or global economy has weakened."", ""With Johnson & Johnson, retirees are getting a company that's only 53% as volatile as the S&P 500, yet yields 3% and has increased its base annual payout for 61 consecutive years."", 'The third perfect stock retirees can buy hand over fist in the new bull market is telecom stock AT&T (NYSE: T).', ""Similar to J&J, AT&T struggled in 2023 while the major indexes galloped to double-digit gains. AT&T's issues can be traced to rapidly rising interest rates, which threaten to make debt refinancing costlier, and a Wall Street Journal report from July that alleged lead-sheathed cable use by legacy telecom companies could lead to pricey replacement and environmental costs. While these are genuine issues that shouldn't be ignored, they've also been overblown."", ""For instance, AT&T has noted that only a small percentage of its network utilizes lead-clad cables. Further, it's not found any environmental/health hazards associated with lead-sheathed cables still in use. If there is any financial liability to be had for AT&T, it would almost certainly be determined in the U.S. court system, which would probably take years. In other words, the lead-sheathed cable issue isn't a near-term concern for AT&T."", ""As for concerns about higher interest rates, investors need only look at AT&T's balance sheet for signs of comfort. When AT&T spun out content arm WarnerMedia in April 2022, which was subsequently merged with Discovery to create new media entity Warner Bros. Discovery, the new company took responsibility for certain lots of debt previously held by AT&T. All told, AT&T received $40.4 billion in concessions (including cash payments). Inclusive of organic pay-down, AT&T's net debt has fallen from $169 billion to just a shade below $129 billion in under two years. It's in considerably better financial shape than it was in 2022."", ""On top of an improved balance sheet, AT&T's operating performance is benefiting from the 5G revolution. Faster download speeds have encouraged users to consume more data. Data just happens to be the primary margin driver for AT&T's wireless segment."", ""Last year also marked the sixth consecutive year that AT&T added at least 1 million net broadband users. Even though broadband isn't the growth driver it was two decades ago, it's the perfect dangling carrot to encourage service bundling, which ultimately boosts margins and cash flow for the company."", ""Retirees who buy AT&T stock are getting an inexpensive (8X forward-year earnings) and time-tested company that's 28% less-volatile than the S&P 500 and doling out a yield in excess of 6%."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

Shares declined 7% in 2023, in fact, to make the footwear giant one of the worst-performing members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.', ""There were some good reasons for the slump, as Nike is struggling with weak demand trends and a heavily promotional selling environment. These challenges won't last forever, though, meaning patient shareholders have a chance to see excellent returns from buying the stock while pessimism is running high on Wall Street."", ""But is Nike a good buy or a value trap right now? Let's dive right in."", 'Nike looks cheap when judged against its recent earnings. Investors are paying about 29 times profit today, down from the early 2022 mark of roughly 40 times earnings. Foot Locker, one of its retailing partners, is priced at 34 times earnings today, and Lululemon Athletica is going for over 60 times profit.', 'The discount is even more prominent with respect to sales, which can smooth out volatility around profit swings. You have to pay only about 3 times annual revenue for Nike stock right now, a valuation level that investors have seen just a few times in the past several years, and only briefly at that.', 'Of course, that discount reflects some significant operating challenges affecting the footwear giant today. Despite a steady flow of new product releases, sales fell 1% in the most recent quarter that included the start of the holiday shopping season. Nike is being pinched by weaker demand across its digital and in-store selling channels as shoppers become more cautious in their discretionary purchases.', 'Sneaker fans are increasingly looking for deals, too, which has retailers cutting costs aggressively right now. ""We saw softness in digital traffic and higher levels of promotional activity across the marketplace,"" executives told investors in a recent conference call.', ""On the bright side, Nike's profits are holding up well in this tough environment. Cost cuts and prudent inventory management are helping. Nike is also showing off its pricing power, with average prices rising this past quarter. Demand was especially strong in its higher-priced shoes that sell for over $100, executives said in late December."", ""You can see the positive impact of these wins in several of Nike's financial metrics. Gross profit margin rose last quarter and earnings were up 27% after adjusting for currency exchange rate shifts. Gains here suggest the stock could rally sharply as profits soar once the footwear industry starts growing again."", 'Unfortunately, things will likely get worse before that rebound begins. Nike is projecting even weaker sales trends in the second half of this fiscal year. The company has sped up plans to cut inventory levels further and to slow down the flow of supply to its retailing partners.', 'Nike is preparing to get back on the offensive with a stepped-up pace of new product launches beginning in fiscal 2025. In the meantime, the focus is on extending the positive momentum that investors are already seeing around profitability.', 'Yet shareholder returns could remain weak until Nike can show real progress at accelerating its growth. Most investors will want to simply watch this stock, then, despite its unusually cheap valuation right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nike wasn't one of them.

But over the past few years, the fintech landscape has ballooned with new competition. While PayPal is still very much a global leader in e-commerce among merchants and consumers, investors have soured on the stock as growth concerns linger.', 'During the past three years, PayPal stock has tumbled more than 70%. New Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss took the reins during the latter half of 2023 and has embarked on reorganizing his management team, a move that may suggest PayPal is intent on reinventing itself.', 'Earlier this month, Chriss sat down with CNBC\'s David Faber for a panel discussion. Toward the end of the interview, Chriss declared that PayPal was going to ""shock the world"" during a highly anticipated public unveiling of new features on the payments platform. On Jan. 25, PayPal released an initial view of its new services and Chriss spoke at length about the company\'s vision to transform itself a more expansive fintech solution.', ""Let's dig in and assess what's going on at the company."", 'PayPal showcased its innovations in a recorded video presentation hosted by Chriss. The company announced a host of new products across the PayPal ecosystem, as well as its peer-to-peer payments app, Venmo.', ""While each new service is unique in its own right, there was one theme that Chriss hit on over and over again: Artificial intelligence (AI) will be the backbone of PayPal's next phase of evolution."", ""On the surface, AI has myriad applications for e-commerce. For example, one of PayPal's new features is called Smart Receipts. Simply put, after you make a purchase from a vendor, PayPal will use AI to analyze the data on your receipt and make a personalized recommendation of other products you may be interested in."", 'The benefits for the merchant are pretty obvious -- this is a mechanism to get shoppers to make multiple purchases and create a more sticky base for vendors. For the consumer, the benefits are that PayPal is helping you find a good deal and allowing you to earn cash back.', 'Another new application PayPal highlighted was Venmo Business Profiles. (For those who are unfamiliar, Venmo is a payments platform similar to Zelle or Cash App.)', ""The addition of profiles on Venmo is geared toward helping small businesses broaden their reach. For instance, if you pay a vendor at a store using Venmo, the shopper's transaction history can be seen by other people in the app's newsfeed, which theoretically can put your business on more radars."", ""While I see the merit in some of PayPal's new services, I have some concerns over its AI ambitions."", ""For starters, Smart Receipts is far from the only service that makes recommendations based on your shopping patterns. E-commerce juggernaut Amazon has been doing this for years and has more than solid footing when it comes to enticing repeat purchases. Even though the feature itself may bolster PayPal's overall suite, it could ultimately be too little, too late."", ""On the Venmo side, I question how popular the business profiles will become. Although this is purely anecdotal, I can't tell you the number of times I've noticed a friend using a cool product and they told me that they found the vendor through Instagram."", ""Although the intersection of social connection and commerce is an interesting one, it's not exactly new. Furthermore, this isn't the first time PayPal has shown an interest in offering its financial service with a social element. While Instagram isn't necessarily an e-commerce platform, per se, it no doubt plays a major role in the discovery of business owners and indirectly facilitating shopping activity."", 'Additionally, while this is speculation on my part, if PayPal pulls off its AI endeavors, I see the company as a potential acquisition target. Chriss is a product visionary and is no stranger to mergers and acquisitions.', ""During his tenure as a leader at Intuit, Chriss played a major role in the company's acquisition of email marketing automation platform Mailchimp. This deal served as a way for Intuit to broaden its reach and give customers a more complete, end-to-end solution offering both financial services software and customer engagement tools."", ""After reviewing PayPal's new product releases, a few things come to mind. First, the company's big bet on AI could very well be the key to unlocking potential and some much-needed innovation. However, I'd caution investors from pouring into the stock solely based on the company's AI vision."", 'PayPal needs to prove that these investments will yield improved financial and operational performance. Moreover, taking a position in the stock based on speculation of a buyout is also not a prudent investment practice.', 'As I recently expressed, PayPal stock is historically cheap and an improving macroeconomic picture could bode well for the company. For now, taking a small position in the stock could be a decent strategy, as expectations seem pretty low. However, keeping a close eye on the company is crucial, and management will need to effectively communicate the magnitude by which its AI tools are contributing to the overall business and its long-term prospects.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

That's what PayPal did on Friday when it used PYUSD—the $1 token it launched last August—to distribute $5 million of its $6.5 million in a crypto-focused startup."", ""It was a clever trick to give a little boost to PYUSD, whose launch was hailed as an important new bridge between crypto and mainstream finance, but whose adoption has been underwhelming. As of this week, PYUSD's market cap is only $300 million, which is ninth among all stablecoins and less than 1% of category leaders USDC and Tether. Part of the problem may be a chicken-and-egg thing as PayPal must show a critical mass of people using PYUSD to get others to follow suit—and so using its own venture investments seems shrewd."", 'If all goes well and PYUSD catches on more broadly, PayPal will have a new source of growth at a time when it badly needs one. Shareholders are fed up with the company as its stock trades around $61, down over 80% from a pandemic-induced sugar high that saw PYPL reach a record $308.', 'PayPal\'s first-year CEO, Alex Chriss, didn\'t help his cause when he went on CNBC earlier this month to say the firm would roll out product updates that would ""shock the world""—remarks that caused shares to climb 5% in anticipation, but then fall by more than that amount after analysts concluded they were more bored than shocked by the announcements. There\'s a reason the adage goes ""underpromise and over deliver"" and not the other way round.', ""That said, Chriss does not have an easy hand to play since product tweaks are unlikely to do anything to help PayPal with its biggest problem: Apple. The iPhone maker's Apple Pay service is gobbling market share when it comes to e-commerce and retail transactions, and a good part of that is coming at the expense of PayPal. Short of PayPal launching a hardware device to compete with iPhone, which won't happen for obvious reasons, it's hard to see how the company fights back. Meanwhile, PayPal also has strained relations with another tech giant, Amazon, which booted its Venmo service in December."", ""Given all this, PayPal's best bet to become a growth story once again is by winning the next era of payments technology. That era is likely to feature plenty of AI—which featured prominently in the company's recent announcements—as well as stablecoins. PayPal is on the right track in both these areas, but it will also need plenty of luck if it's going to hold its ground for the long term."", 'Jeff John Robertsjeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

There's nothing unusual about that, but for one thing: the payments giant used its PYUSD stablecoin, which it launched last August, for $5 million of its investment."", 'The recipient of the stablecoin investment is Mesh, a startup founded by cybersecurity veterans who sold their first venture to LogMeIn, which operates the password manager LastPass. Their new startup is likewise focused on secure communications, though in the form of crypto-based financial transactions.', ""You can think of Mesh as the crypto version of Plaid, the service you've likely used that lets you connect your bank account to apps and websites by entering your online banking credentials. Mesh cofounder and CEO Bam Azizi says the Plaid comparison is accurate, but only to a point as his crypto service has a much larger role when it comes to transferring cryptocurrencies."", ""In practice, this means Mesh serves as a way to move funds between everything from crypto exchanges to wallets to financial apps that support crypto. The advantage of the service, Azizi says, is that it doesn't require users to cut and paste a long string of characters—common for crypto transfers—which he describes as a poor security practice. Instead, Mesh users just use an in-app menu."", ""Mesh says hundreds of companies are integrating its services, including well-known exchanges and fintech firms, but that it can't disclose specific names at this time. Azizi says the startup, which is pulling in more than $1 million in revenue, is not currently profitable but easily could be if it he so chose."", ""In addition to the $5 million it gave Mesh in the form of stablecoins, which was recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, PayPal Ventures added another $1.5 million in cash. This comes after the startup's $22 million Series A funding round last year that included backers such as Money Forward, Galaxy, and Samsung Next."", 'PayPal launched PYUSD in August with the help of Paxos, a New York-based firm produces white-label stablecoins. While PYUSD still holds only a small portion of the overall stablecoin market, which is worth around $135 billion and is dominated by Tether, it grew over 70% between mid-December and mid-January, and its market cap is around $300 million.', ""The decision to make the Mesh investment using PYUSD, which is part of PayPal's broader strategy of offering more payment options around the world, appears designed to further increase the circulation of the stablecoin."", '“We are confident that this investment will fuel Mesh’s growth and contribute significantly to the advancement of embedded finance and native stablecoins,"" Amman Bhasin of PayPal Ventures said in a statement.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Investors often view these stocks favorably because they are perceived as reliable income generators. The ability to consistently increase dividends over a long period is seen as a sign of financial strength and stability. In addition to this, these stocks have shown remarkable performance over the years, outperforming various other types of assets. As per a ProShares report citing data from Factset, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index exhibited an impressive return of 27.7% from March 2022 to April 2023. In comparison, the broader S&P 500, during the same timeframe, delivered a slightly lower return of 25.2%.', 'These stocks not only delivered impressive returns in the recent past but have consistently outperformed since the inception of the index in 2005, particularly highlighting the sustained success of dividend aristocrats. The ProShares report further mentioned that since its launch, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has consistently outpaced the S&P 500, demonstrating reduced volatility and the potential to transform a $10,000 initial investment in May 2005 into over $61,000 by March 2023. The index boasts an impressive upside-downside capture of 91% and 80%, indicating robust performance in both bullish and bearish market conditions.

Investors hold divergent opinions on this matter, but analysts consistently advocate for companies exhibiting robust and consistent dividend growth. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist affiliated with Morningstar's Index team, has frequently expressed support for companies that consistently increase their dividends. In a recent report from the firm, the analyst said investing in dividend growth differs significantly from high-dividend investing. A portfolio focused on dividend growth indicates a company's strong competitive position and improving fortunes. Such a portfolio tends to align more closely with the overall market in terms of sector exposures, growth and value characteristics, and metrics like price-to-earnings. While it may still lean towards value, a dividend growth portfolio is considered more balanced and core-oriented compared to a high-dividend portfolio."", 'Undervalued dividend aristocrats also often attract significant attention and interest among investors.

The Refining & Marketing (R&M) segment adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 billion for the quarter, down from $4.6 billion in Q4 2022, primarily due to lower market crack spreads. The R&M margin per barrel decreased to $17.79 from $28.82 year-over-year, with crude capacity utilization at approximately 91%. The Midstream segment, however, showed an increase in adjusted EBITDA to $1.6 billion, up from $1.4 billion in the prior year's quarter."", ""These financial metrics are crucial as they reflect the company's ability to generate profit from its core operations. The decrease in R&M segment adjusted EBITDA is significant as it indicates the impact of market conditions on refining margins, a key driver of profitability for MPC. Conversely, the Midstream segment's performance underscores the resilience and growth potential of MPC's diversified asset base."", ""MPC's financial achievements in 2023, particularly the robust cash flow generation and substantial capital return to shareholders, underscore the company's financial health and commitment to shareholder value. The $14.1 billion in net cash provided by operating activities and the return of $12.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends are testaments to MPC's operational efficiency and strategic capital allocation. In the Oil & Gas industry, where capital discipline and shareholder returns are paramount, these achievements highlight MPC's competitive positioning and financial prudence."", ""Looking ahead, MPC has outlined a capital spending outlook for 2024 of $1.25 billion, with a focus on growth and sustainability.

This press release and supporting schedules include the non-GAAP measures adjusted EBITDA; consolidated debt to last twelve months adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to as our leverage ratio; distributable cash flow (DCF); adjusted free cash flow (Adjusted FCF); and adjusted free cash flow after distributions.

Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered separately from or as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow as reflected in our financial statements. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for: (i) provision for income taxes; (ii) interest and other financial costs; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) income/(loss) from equity method investments; (v) distributions and adjustments related to equity method investments; (vi) gain on sales-type leases; (vii) impairment expense; (viii) noncontrolling interests; and (ix) other adjustments, as applicable. In general, we define DCF as adjusted EBITDA adjusted for (i) deferred revenue impacts; (ii) sales-type lease payments, net of income; (iii) net interest and other financial costs; (iv) net maintenance capital expenditures; (v) equity method investment maintenance capital expenditures paid out; and (vi) other adjustments as deemed necessary."", 'The Partnership makes a distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives.

We believe DCF is an important financial measure for unitholders as an indicator of cash return on investment and to evaluate whether the partnership is generating sufficient cash flow to support quarterly distributions.

This year, instead of the brand being on-screen, Miller Lite is looking to 1,000 of its fans to handle its advertising through the “Running of the Beer Ads” effort.', '“We’ve always been excited by [the Super Bowl]\xa0as an opportunity to engage fans in creative and unexpected ways. That’s not going to change just because we can buy a national ad now,” said Ann Legan, global vice president of marketing for the Miller Family of Brands, in emailed comments to Marketing Dive. “We’ve always tried to show up in ways no other beer could, and we’re confident we will this year, too.”', 'Consumers beginning Feb. 1 can sign-up online to receive the official Miller Game Time Jersey along with $100 and a Big Game Ad kit.

Additionally, the top five individuals whose jerseys are scanned the most will receive beer for a year, per release details, an incentive that could encourage participants to be more actively involved.', 'To help drum up excitement, actor Riggle will encourage consumers to sign-up and participate in the “Running of the Beer Ads” effort.

In November, Cruise paused all autonomous activities across the country after an accident in which a Cruise robotaxi ran over a woman, stopped on top of her, and then dragged her for about 20 feet before pulling over. The woman suffered severe injuries from the accident. A few weeks later, Kyle Vogt, CEO of GM’s Cruise autonomous driving division, announced he was resigning from his role and leaving the company.', 'Late last week, Cruise revealed it was under investigation by the Department of Justice and SEC, among other regulatory bodies, concerning the incident with the pedestrian and Cruise’s actions in the immediate aftermath of the event.', '“At Cruise, we are committed to earning back the trust of regulators and the public through our commitments and our actions,” Barra said.', '""This was an important quarter to help regain Street confidence that has been shaken the last few quarters with the EV vision in flux and Cruise black eye,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tweeted on Tuesday morning.

GM expects to reduce shares outstanding to below 1 billion, down from about 1.2 billion currently and 1.6 billion at the post-IPO peak, Barra said.', 'GM shares rose 8.7% in early trading.', 'Barra highlighted moves to return cash to shareholders, including $12 billion in 2023 through a $10 billion share buyback and a 33% dividend increase.', '""We are prioritizing returning cash to our shareholders,"" Barra said. GM\'s 2024 forecast calls for $8 billion to $10 billion in free cash flow, nearly all of it generated by GM\'s internal combustion engine, or ICE, vehicles.', '""The ICE machine is up and working again … please proceed to the end of the hallway and fill your buckets!"" Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally wrote in a note.', 'GM is pinning hopes on strong demand for its combustion trucks and SUVs in North America, cost-cutting and increasing sales of its new generation of electric vehicles after 2023 deliveries fell short of earlier plans. GM expects overall EV sales will rise this year to 10% of the U.S. market from 7% in 2023.', 'However, Barra said GM will launch plug-in hybrid vehicles in North America, a turn away from a strategy of bypassing hybrid powertrains in that market. U.S. hybrid sales have been rising as consumers balk at high EV prices and recharging infrastructure challenges.', '""We know the EV market is not going to grow linearly,"" CFO Paul Jacobson told analysts. ""We are prepared to flex between ICE and EV production.""', 'CRUISE UNIT, CHINA POSE CHALLENGES', ""Analysts questioned Barra about potential shifts in GM's money-losing EV and self-driving vehicle strategies, as well as declining sales in China."", '""We\'re not going to shy away from making tough calls"" to protect profitability, Barra said. ""Nothing is off the table.""', 'GM will delay an investor day planned for March until later this year ""because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise,"" Barra said. GM also wants more time to resolve software development problems that have forced the company to stop selling its new Chevrolet Blazer EV.', 'GM expects its electric vehicle operations will begin returning variable profit by the second half the year, Jacobson said.', 'It forecast 2024 adjusted pre-tax profits of $12 billion to $14 billion, compared to $12.4 billion reported for 2023. GM will hold capital spending roughly flat.', 'The 2024 forecast translates to between $8.50 and $9.50 a share, compared to $7.68 in 2023. Fewer shares due to buybacks adds $1.45 a share to the forecast. That will be offset by higher taxes and interest payments.', 'Cost-cutting will play a big role in hitting forecasts, as GM expects vehicle prices to drop. GM plans to cut $400 million from marketing spending, on top of $500 million cut last year, Jacobson said. Engineers have cut $200 million from product development costs, Barra said.', ""For the fourth quarter, GM reported net income rose 5.2% to $2.1 billion on revenues of $43 billion. Adjusted pre-tax profit fell by 54% to $1.8 billion. The decrease reflected the impact of last fall's United Auto Workers' strikes, higher costs at Cruise and a $1.1 billion writedown related to EV battery cells held in inventory, the company said."", 'Spending at the troubled Cruise robo-taxi unit will be cut by $1 billion. Cruise halted operations after one of its self-driving cars dragged a woman down a San Francisco street.', 'Barra said GM will ""refocus and relaunch Cruise,"" without disclosing a timetable. Cruise lost $2.7 billion in 2023, not including $500 million in restructuring costs incurred in the fourth quarter as the unit cut staff.', 'Separately, GM faces deepening challenges in China, once its largest market. Domestic automakers and Tesla are gaining share with electrified vehicles, fresh infotainment technology and aggressive price cutting. GM expects to post a China loss for the current quarter, Jacobson said.', '""We have a lot of inventory we are working through in first quarter"" in China, he said.', '(Reporting by Joe White; Editing by Stephen Coates, Christina Fincher, David Ljunggren and Nick Zieminski)']"

GM's calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures."", 'These non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.', 'EBIT-adjusted\xa0(Most comparable GAAP measure: Net income attributable to stockholders)\xa0 EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item.

The airline needed to drop prices and fill seats in December after travel sites such as Booking.com, Kiwi, and Kayak removed Ryanair flights from their websites, which CFO Neil Sorahan said contributed to a lower load factor.', 'O’Leary said Ryanair was also impacted by Boeing production delays. They were originally contracted to receive 57 aircraft.', '“We are pushing very hard with the entire Boeing team to ensure we get at least 50 aircrafts by the end of June,” O’Leary said.', 'Ryanair has at times kept faith with Boeing after past crises. In December 2020, Ryanair bought 75 Boeing Max jets, the manufacturer’s largest order since a March 2019 grounding and two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. Traders said Ryanair could have gotten a discount of 50% off listed prices, though Ryanair did not disclose the price of the 2020 deal.', 'But the discount airline has not always supported its sole supplier through tough times. Ryanair experienced aircraft delivery delays from Boeing before, including the May 2022 delays that prompted the “headless chicken” comment. In September 2021, Ryanair publicly confronted Boeing about the aerospace giant not agreeing to Ryanair’s named price on an order of 737 Max 8 jets.', 'His American counterparts at both Alaska Airlines and United Airlines have been outright angry over Boeing’s manufacturing issues. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said that Boeing needs to take “real action” to improve quality, while his airline revealed on Jan. 22 that they expect to lose money in the first quarter owing to Boeing 737 Max 9 groundings. Alaska Airlines demanded a minimum $150 million reimbursement in losses from Boeing after a door plug flew off Alaska’s Flight 1282 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft on Jan. 5, and CEO Ben Minicucci said the airline found many additional loose bolts on other grounded 737 aircraft. “I am more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry,” Minicucci said in a NBC Nightly News interview that aired Tuesday.', 'Southwest Airlines also has grievances against Boeing. It took 737 Max 7 planes out of its fleet plans because of Boeing’s supply-chain issues and certification delays by the Federal Aviation Administration. It expects to receive 79 of the 85 originally contracted aircraft.', 'After a month of disasters, Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft are able to get off the ground again.', 'United Airlines resumed Max 9 flights on Saturday, and Alaska Airlines cleared some Max 9 flights on Friday afternoon following inspections.', 'Delivery delays are exacerbated by the FAA’s freeze on Boeing 737 Max production increases, which prevents the manufacturer from growing its output of its bestselling aircraft past 38 jets per month, a Boeing spokesperson told Fortune. A Bank of America Securities report released Monday underlined the impact the production increase freeze and delays could have on Boeing, as customers begin to look elsewhere for aircraft.', '“We think it is unlikely that customers will break their contracts and cancel orders (as this would result in a charge to the customer); however, we do think that these customers may use the delay as a reason to look elsewhere for future aircraft needs,” analysts wrote.', 'Ryanair reiterated Thursday that it supports the FAA’s freeze and that the production increase halt would not further delay deliveries to Ryanair.', '“Ryanair also welcomes the FAA’s decision to postpone Boeing’s proposed monthly production rate increase, which will allow Boeing the time and space to improve quality control of the aircraft it currently manufactures,” Ryanair said in a statement to Reuters.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

When you look at the Spirit and JetBlue transaction, very similar in the sense where JetBlue wanted additional lift and if you had to go to an OEM [Original Equipment Manufacturer] and order new planes, it\'s going to take a long period of time.

That\'s according to ""The Wall Street Journal."" Now, airlines are dealing with the ramifications of the incident, including delivery delays. Boeing has halted production expansion for the 737 MAX 9.', 'And United is now reportedly in talks with Airbus about purchasing jets, which could replace an existing order of Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets. For more on the fallout, we have Conor Cunningham, Melius Research Director. Conor, great to have you here with us this morning on this matter. How perhaps expediently do you believe a lot of the airlines are shifting their conversations about future orders as a result of the 737 Max 9 issue?', ""CONOR CUNNINGHAM: Thanks for having me. So I think that what the airlines are trying to do is just have a potential plan in place if the MAX 10 is potentially delayed for a longer period of time. So when you look at United specifically, they're very much committed to Boeing over the long term with the 787 and the MAX aircraft."", 'But in the immediate near term and medium term, they need to figure out how to find additional lift to hit their plans. This entire environment for the airlines has really been about capacity constraints overall. When you look at the Spirit and JetBlue transaction, very similar in the sense where JetBlue wanted additional lift.', ""And if you had to go to an OEM and order new planes, it's going to take a long period of time. So it's about trying to figure out how you're going to grow in a really constrained environment. If you're able to grow, you potentially are a winner. So that's why United's trying to look for remedies around potential delays coming from the MAX right now."", ""SEANA SMITH: Conor, let's talk a little bit more about JetBlue and Spirit because JetBlue obviously saying that it could scrap this deal if that in fact does happen. Talk to us a little bit more about the implications of that. Obviously, it will put Spirit in a pretty tough spot. But what does it mean just for JetBlue's ability to compete here with some of the larger airlines?"", 'CONOR CUNNINGHAM: Yeah. So JetBlue, they have their own issues with the GTF grounding. Spirit does as well. But a lot of these growth carriers, the smaller ULCCs out there have had their models under pressure during the resurgence in travel demand. You know, historically, they used to grow 10% to 20%, and they were able to outgrow their cost structures.', ""Now there's been a lot of cost convergence out there as growth has slowed. So what is JetBlue going to have to do post transaction? My guess is that they're going to need to shrink a little bit. They've already talked about reducing some routes on the edges. They're potentially looking for early outs with employees."", ""So they're probably going to be smaller. Spirit's probably going to need to be smaller as well as they look to concentrate around the markets that have made the highest return. So that's probably not what the judge wanted when he initially ruled in that favor. But it's kind of the environment that they're dealing with at this time.""]"

281,e997d62e-92a2-3581-85d9-42b65bfd142d,V,2024-01-30,3 Perfect Stocks for Retirees to Buy Hand Over Fist in the New Bull Market,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e997d62e-92a2-3581-85d9-42b65bfd142d/3-perfect-stocks-for-retirees.html,1706609160,STORY,"['JNJ', 'V', 'T', 'SPGI', '^GSPC']","[""Patience has proven invaluable to long-term investors, with every stock market correction, crash, and bear market eventually put into the rearview mirror by a bull market rally. But over shorter periods, Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), has proved unpredictable."", ""In successive years since this decade began, the S&P 500 has bounced between bear and bull markets. Although some investors define a bull market as one which has rallied at least 20% from a recent low, there's little question that a new bull market has emerged when a major stock index reaches a new all-time high. With the S&P 500 recently taking out its previous high, we can proclaim without a shadow of a doubt that we're in a bull market (which actually began more than 15 months ago)."", 'While a major stock index hitting a new high might turn some value-seeking investors off, rest assured that bargains can still be found. This holds true for younger investors seeking to put their money to work in game-changing businesses, as well as retirees who value capital preservation, but also still want to grow their nest egg.', 'What follows are three perfect stocks retirees can confidently buy hand over fist in the new bull market.', 'The first genius stock that retirees can fearlessly add to their portfolios is world-leading payment processor Visa (NYSE: V).', ""Every single publicly traded company has potential headwinds. For Visa, the biggest concern is that it's cyclical. If the U.S. or global economy fall into a recession, the expectation would be for consumer and enterprise spending to taper. Less spending and fewer transactions would be a recipe for weaker growth or possibly even revenue contraction for Visa and its peers."", ""But here's the thing: Recessions are disproportionately short-lived events. There have been a dozen recessions since the end of World War II, and only three have managed to endure 12 months. Of the remaining three, none lasted longer than 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of expansion stick around for multiple years, with a couple reaching the decade mark. Aggregate consumer and enterprise spending are pushing higher over long periods, which is a seemingly foolproof investment thesis in favor of Visa."", ""It also doesn't hurt that Visa's management team has kept the company focused on payment processing and avoided the temptations of lending. Though I have little doubt that Visa would succeed as a lender and generate plenty of interest income, it would also expose the company to loan losses and credit delinquencies during recessions. Sticking to its bread-and-butter maximizes Visa's financial flexibility and minimizes any pain felt during economic downturns."", ""Additionally, you're getting the undisputed leader in payment facilitation when you buy Visa stock. According to Nilson Report, Visa accounted for nearly 42% of credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. in 2022. The U.S. is the largest market for consumption globally."", 'Furthermore, Visa has a multidecade growth runway in underbanked emerging markets, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. It has more than enough capital and operating cash flow to organically expand into these markets, or can make acquisitions to rapidly broaden its reach, as it did in 2016 when it purchased Visa Europe.', 'Visa offers retirees the ability to enjoy sustained double-digit growth potential, yet its stock is 5% less-volatile than the benchmark S&P 500.', 'A second stock that\'s ideal for retirees to buy hand over fist in the new bull market is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is better known by its shorthand, ""J&J.""', ""Whereas the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are thriving in bull markets, J&J has lagged these respective indexes. The reason? Johnson & Johnson is facing up to 100,000 lawsuits over its now-discontinued talc-based baby powder that allege it causes cancer. In addition to settling a $700 million investigation into its baby powder by more than 40 states, it's had two settlement attempts (the latest offered $8.9 billion to settle the aforementioned 100,000 lawsuits) thrown out in court. Wall Street doesn't like unknowns, and there's no certainty as to when this litigation will have a resolution."", ""The solace for current and prospective J&J investors is that there may not be a more operationally sound company on the planet. It's one of only two publicly traded companies that currently holds the coveted AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more-familiar S&P Global. The highest credit rating possible signals that S&P expects J&J to be able to service its outstanding debt and liabilities with ease."", ""What's really been powering Johnson & Johnson's success is its focus on pharmaceuticals. For more than a decade, management has increased the company's reliance on brand-name drugs. Even though novel therapies have finite periods of patent exclusivity, they generate juicy margins and afford J&J strong pricing power. Since Johnson & Johnson is bringing in a mountain of operating cash flow each year, it's been able to aggressively reinvest in novel research, as well as forge collaborations to avoid patent-cliff issues."", ""Another reason J&J has been such a superstar investment for decades is the continuity it's seen in key leadership positions. You only need two hands to count how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding 138 years ago. No carousel at the top means consistency in the bottom line."", ""I'll also add that healthcare is an exceptionally defensive sector. People don't stop needing prescription medicine and medical devices just because the U.S. or global economy has weakened."", ""With Johnson & Johnson, retirees are getting a company that's only 53% as volatile as the S&P 500, yet yields 3% and has increased its base annual payout for 61 consecutive years."", 'The third perfect stock retirees can buy hand over fist in the new bull market is telecom stock AT&T (NYSE: T).', ""Similar to J&J, AT&T struggled in 2023 while the major indexes galloped to double-digit gains. AT&T's issues can be traced to rapidly rising interest rates, which threaten to make debt refinancing costlier, and a Wall Street Journal report from July that alleged lead-sheathed cable use by legacy telecom companies could lead to pricey replacement and environmental costs. While these are genuine issues that shouldn't be ignored, they've also been overblown."", ""For instance, AT&T has noted that only a small percentage of its network utilizes lead-clad cables. Further, it's not found any environmental/health hazards associated with lead-sheathed cables still in use. If there is any financial liability to be had for AT&T, it would almost certainly be determined in the U.S. court system, which would probably take years. In other words, the lead-sheathed cable issue isn't a near-term concern for AT&T."", ""As for concerns about higher interest rates, investors need only look at AT&T's balance sheet for signs of comfort. When AT&T spun out content arm WarnerMedia in April 2022, which was subsequently merged with Discovery to create new media entity Warner Bros. Discovery, the new company took responsibility for certain lots of debt previously held by AT&T. All told, AT&T received $40.4 billion in concessions (including cash payments). Inclusive of organic pay-down, AT&T's net debt has fallen from $169 billion to just a shade below $129 billion in under two years. It's in considerably better financial shape than it was in 2022."", ""On top of an improved balance sheet, AT&T's operating performance is benefiting from the 5G revolution. Faster download speeds have encouraged users to consume more data. Data just happens to be the primary margin driver for AT&T's wireless segment."", ""Last year also marked the sixth consecutive year that AT&T added at least 1 million net broadband users. Even though broadband isn't the growth driver it was two decades ago, it's the perfect dangling carrot to encourage service bundling, which ultimately boosts margins and cash flow for the company."", ""Retirees who buy AT&T stock are getting an inexpensive (8X forward-year earnings) and time-tested company that's 28% less-volatile than the S&P 500 and doling out a yield in excess of 6%."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

So I want to have you first set the scene here in terms of what this means in terms of oil supply and demand now that we see that this is escalating.', ""AYHAM KAMEL: I think in the first instance, there will be no impact-- direct impact on oil supply in the region. I think more likely than not, the Biden administration is creating a calibrated military response that appears very loud in terms of targeting militias in Iraq and Syria to rebuild that lost US deterrence on the military front. But I think the appetite to move into something direct that hits Iran or hits Iranian export, it's still low for now."", ""So I think there's reluctance to do something in terms of tinkering with oil supplies that might impact inflation expectations, and over the long term, even Biden's own position domestically. So more likely than not, we're looking at a contained conflict with a higher risk that it expands. For now, the Biden administration is probably going to be careful."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: Scott, let me get your reaction to what Adam said. I mean, do you agree that potential disruption to oil markets pretty much contained there and that the broader concern as it relates to the energy space really is about the demand picture, largely coming out of China too?', ""SCOTT BAUER: No doubt about it, and I wholeheartedly agree. I do think even now with oil prices down today, there's probably about $3 to $4 of risk premium already built in because of tensions in the Middle East, especially with what happened over the weekend. But you can see the reaction today, it really goes to what you guys were just talking about. That the response is probably going to be very tempered. And the bottom line is, oil prices are on their heels right now."", ""And it is all because of demand or lack of it, should we say. We do have OPEC coming out next week, which given everything that's going on, given the tensions in the Middle East, that could disrupt the marketplace. But I really don't think so. So to me as a trader, I actually love this extra volatility. And though much of the marketplace is looking at this as a buy the dip because of the escalated tensions out there, I actually look at this as selling what we call selling the rip or selling a move higher."", ""Because the overall macro picture of crude is absolutely on the bearish side. Obviously, things can escalate very quickly. You can always have a big pop, if God forbid, something really tragic happens here. So if you're trading, if you're trading with options or just with futures, you always need to use a star. But I would look to sell any pop that we get in the near term."", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: So, Ayham, in terms of the response that we tend to see from OPEC as we saw with the Russia Ukraine crisis in the Middle here, what response are you expecting from OPEC at the upcoming meeting?', ""AYHAM KAMEL: Well, I think Saudi Arabia, who really exactly is the engine of OPEC plus, will be looking at a very comfortable price range. I think for the Saudis, OPEC plus in general, any range of oil prices and the '80s is completely acceptable. There's not likely to be a big reaction to put additional barrels on the market in the current environment. One exception to that would be if we saw an escalation of the regional conflict and it begins to impact supplies."", ""Then the Saudis would consider to work more actively with OPEC plus to try to create some form of relief over there. But currently, given just the demand picture that we've discussed on the show and the supply risks as they are, the Saudis will be cautious in terms of putting additional. Or taking barrels or putting additional barrels on the market sale stable status quo works for now, particularly given the spending commitments on Vision 2030."", 'And I think that the Saudis can deliver on that. One key point I would just add, that things-- yes, there is an intention by the Biden administration to calibrate its response. But military conflicts and regional crises have the tendency to create their own dynamics. Where we are today is not a very comfortable place in terms of risks in general. I do expect additional tit for tat military strikes and confrontation between the US and the militias in Iraq and Syria. This is not going to be a comfortable couple of weeks at all.']"

Many of these long-standing, high-quality companies pay a dividend to shareholders, and these can be some of the most consistent dividend payers in the market.', ""But when dividend yields climb too high, it might be a warning sign for investors. A stock might have a high dividend yield because the outlook for the business (or the dividend itself) doesn't bode well. While the following three companies are all part of the premier blue chip index, investors need to dive deeper before jumping into a stock simply for its payout."", ""Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) has offered a generous dividend for a long time, but its yield has moved substantially higher over the last 18 months. That's not a result of its dividend increases (although the company has raised its dividend for 17 years straight). It's the result of a significant decline in the stock price."", ""Verizon shares were punished as the company faced significant costs in building out its 5G network while seeing an exodus of customers. Meanwhile, the debt-laden business was challenged by rising interest rates, which presented a double-whammy for Verizon shares since investors could get a relatively high and safe yield from treasuries instead of buying Verizon's shares."", 'The company appears to have turned the corner, though. It saw a net increase of 100,000 in total postpaid phone customers in the third quarter, bolstered by its business segment. It built on that momentum in the fourth quarter with 449,000 net postpaid phone adds, showing significant strength in the consumer segment with 318,000 net additions.', 'Meanwhile, forthcoming interest-rate cuts should provide some nice support for the stock. Still, Verizon has the challenge to maintain market share in the wireless industry, and growth from its home broadband business may not be sustainable. There are better investment options in the telecom sector, although few yield as much as Verizon.', ""For investors who are particularly attracted to Verizon's dividend yield, the dividend is relatively safe. Verizon's free cash flow can support the current payout. And with the stock trading at around 8x management's outlook for 2024 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), it's a fair value."", ""3M (NYSE: MMM) has paid a dividend for more than 100 years and raised its payout to shareholders for 64 consecutive years. But its share price has fallen considerably faster than its dividend has increased over the past three years. That's resulted in a substantially elevated dividend yield, which now stands around 6.25%."", ""There are a few reasons for 3M's price decline. After strong sales growth amid the pandemic, thanks to surging demand for masks and respirators, 3M faced a hangover following the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines and the end of mask mandates. Meanwhile, the company faced a lawsuit for its earplugs used by the U.S. Military. It settled that lawsuit in 2023, agreeing to pay $6 billion."", ""But there may be signs of other underlying issues for 3M as well. It's not spending as much on research and development (R&D) as it used to. R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, fell to just 5.6% over the past four quarters, near its lowest levels in the past decade."", ""Instead, it's relying more on acquisitions to fuel growth, which comes with a lot more risk and lower return on capital. That's a bit concerning, considering the company's biggest competitive advantage is its ability to innovate."", ""That said, the market's punishment of the stock may have gone too far after an 11% drop in the share price following 3M's disappointing 2024 outlook alongside its fourth-quarter results. Shares currently trade around 10x analysts' consensus estimate for its 2024 earnings per share. And with management prioritizing the dividend, it's hardly at risk of collapsing."", 'If you want a high-yield dividend stock with excellent prospects for annual raises, you could do worse than 3M.', 'Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) held the title as the highest-yielding Dow Jones stock until earlier this month. Management slashed its dividend in half, alongside the release of its fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings report, ending a streak of 47 years of dividend increases.', ""The company suffered from pressure to raise its dividend every year, while earnings couldn't always keep up with the growing payout."", ""Meanwhile, the company's seen a significant decline in free cash flow, and the cost of borrowing has increased substantially. As a result, management had to make the tough decision to cut the dividend. Yet Walgreens Boots Alliance remains one of the highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones."", ""Walgreens faces challenges from online pharmacies and big-box retailers offering pharmacy services in their stores. In order to combat this competition, it's pushed into healthcare services with its majority stake in VillageMD. At one point, it counted over 200 full-service clinics inside Walgreens stores but is committed to closing 60 underperforming locations this year as part of its cost-cutting efforts."", ""Still, Walgreens' effort to expand beyond the retail pharmacy business could work out well. If customers are coming into its VillageMD locations to see a doctor, there could be valuable synergies with the pharmacy business."", ""Investors have punished Walgreens for the company's poor results and the dividend cut. That said, shares now trade around 7x analysts' consensus earnings estimate for 2024."", 'If you believe the worst is behind Walgreens -- that it can return to earnings growth and accommodate the new dividend -- the yield on the stock is still well above average.

The Fed’s dovish stance and estimates of interest rate cuts in 2024 also bode well. Both AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc. reported a healthy fourth quarter.', 'Below, we highlight fourth-quarter earnings results from these companies.', 'On Jan 23,Verizon Communications VZ reported healthy fourth-quarter numbers, driven by significant 5G adoption and wireless traction.

In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported net income of $6.69 billion or $1.56 per share. This year-over-year decline can be mostly blamed on higher operating expenses led by a goodwill impairment charge. Excluding non-recurring items, quarterly adjusted earnings came in at $1.08 per share compared with $1.19 in the prior-year quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.', 'Total operating revenues of $35.13 billion decreased from $35.25 billion in the prior year but managed to beat the consensus estimate of $34.82 billion. The year-over-year fall was mainly on account of lower wireless equipment revenues generated from a challenging macroeconomic environment and fewer postpaid phone upgrades.', 'The company expects wireless service revenues to grow by 2%-3.5% for 2024.', 'On Jan 24, AT&T T reported relatively healthy fourth-quarter 2023 results as solid wireless traction and customer additions were partially offset by lower demand for legacy voice and data services. The company recorded strong subscriber growth backed by a resilient business model and robust cash flow position driven by a diligent execution of operational plans.', 'On a GAAP basis, the company reported a net income of $2.14 billion or 30 cents per share, which marked a significant year-over-year improvement, primarily due to high asset impairment charges in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 54 cents per share compared with 61 cents in the year-ago quarter and below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.', 'Quarterly GAAP operating revenues increased 2.2% year over year to $32.02 billion, beating the consensus mark of $31.46 billion.

Although investors had differing reactions to both of these stocks, both reported strong growth in their wireless segments, and since these are two of the three nationwide 5G carriers in the U.S. (T-Mobile is the third), they make up most of its telecom industry.', ""Additionally, both began as landline providers following the breakup of the original AT&T, and they have followed similar paths to spearhead today's wireless industry. The question is: Which telecom stock will better serve today's investors?"", 'AT&T is the market share leader, and judging by its growth, that lead does not appear to be threatened. In the fourth quarter, AT&T added 526,000 postpaid phone net additions, taking the 2023 total to 1.7 million.', 'Like its peers, it spends heavily to maintain that business. Capital expenditures amounted to nearly $18 billion in 2023, down slightly from the $20 billion in 2022. That spending, along with some missteps in the cable TV and content businesses, left AT&T with a total debt of $137 billion.', ""Despite that spending, AT&T generated almost $17 billion in free cash flow. This allowed it to easily cover just over $8 billion in dividend costs. That payout, which amounts to $1.11 per share annually, delivers a 7% dividend yield to shareholders, far above the S&P 500's 1.4% payout. Still, with AT&T walking away from a 35-year streak in dividend increases in 2022, some investors harbor doubts about the payout. The past downtrend in the stock price may also deter some investors."", 'Nonetheless, AT&T has risen by approximately 25% since its low in July. Additionally, it sells for less than 7 times forward earnings, a likely testament to the high debt levels and the financial challenges it suffered in recent years. But with its discounted valuation and the rapid growth in net additions, investors could finally see a viable growth trajectory.', 'Among the telecom giants, Verizon is seen as the quality leader. It has won the most J.D. Power awards for network quality 32 consecutive times. The telco also reported 449,000 net additions in Q4 and more than 1.7 million broadband customers, meaning it nearly matches AT&T in adding wireless customers.', 'It also showed its willingness to maintain that quality by spending $53 billion on the C-band spectrum auction in 2021. Since spectrum is the prime real estate of the wireless business, Verizon is well-positioned to maintain that quality lead. Unfortunately, such spending helped leave Verizon with a total debt of almost $151 billion.', 'Fortunately, despite that burden and $19 billion in capital spending for the year, Verizon generated nearly $19 billion in free cash flow for 2023, enough to fund over $11 billion in dividend costs. That payout, which now stands at $2.66 per share annually, yields around 6.3% and has risen for 17 consecutive years.', 'Thanks to a dramatic recovery from its October low, Verizon stock rose slightly over the past year. It has increased by over 35% from the low and sells at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9 even after that gain. Thus, the stock could recover amid robust wireless customer growth and a low valuation.', 'Admittedly, AT&T and Verizon seem to offer few differences. Although both compete for the same customers, they have seen notable growth in mature wireless business. Conversely, both are burdened with heavy debts, and both dividends are likely in danger as the companies look for ways to reduce such obligations.', 'However, the edge likely belongs to AT&T. Since AT&T has already cut its dividend, it is likely to receive less blowback if it cuts the payout again to reduce debt. Moreover, with its higher market share and lower earnings multiple, it is a less risky choice for prospective buyers.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?', 'Before you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and AT&T wasn't one of them.

The EPS surprise was +0.93%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation.

As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming."", ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing.

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Air Products and Chemicals?', ""For Air Products and Chemicals, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.72%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Air Products and Chemicals will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Air Products and Chemicals would post earnings of $3.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.15, delivering a surprise of +1.29%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Investors often view these stocks favorably because they are perceived as reliable income generators. The ability to consistently increase dividends over a long period is seen as a sign of financial strength and stability. In addition to this, these stocks have shown remarkable performance over the years, outperforming various other types of assets. As per a ProShares report citing data from Factset, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index exhibited an impressive return of 27.7% from March 2022 to April 2023. In comparison, the broader S&P 500, during the same timeframe, delivered a slightly lower return of 25.2%.', 'These stocks not only delivered impressive returns in the recent past but have consistently outperformed since the inception of the index in 2005, particularly highlighting the sustained success of dividend aristocrats. The ProShares report further mentioned that since its launch, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has consistently outpaced the S&P 500, demonstrating reduced volatility and the potential to transform a $10,000 initial investment in May 2005 into over $61,000 by March 2023. The index boasts an impressive upside-downside capture of 91% and 80%, indicating robust performance in both bullish and bearish market conditions. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most prominent dividend aristocrat stocks among investors.', ""In the realm of dividend investing, a perpetual struggle exists between prioritizing high yields and emphasizing dividend growth. Investors hold divergent opinions on this matter, but analysts consistently advocate for companies exhibiting robust and consistent dividend growth. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist affiliated with Morningstar's Index team, has frequently expressed support for companies that consistently increase their dividends. In a recent report from the firm, the analyst said investing in dividend growth differs significantly from high-dividend investing. A portfolio focused on dividend growth indicates a company's strong competitive position and improving fortunes. Such a portfolio tends to align more closely with the overall market in terms of sector exposures, growth and value characteristics, and metrics like price-to-earnings. While it may still lean towards value, a dividend growth portfolio is considered more balanced and core-oriented compared to a high-dividend portfolio."", 'Undervalued dividend aristocrats also often attract significant attention and interest among investors.

Gross margins understandably fell off a cliff during the pandemic, having been around 45% between 2014 and 2018 before dropping to about 33% in 2020. However, while revenue has recovered, its gross margins have not, as much of its revenue gains have come from lower-margin ventures. At the same time, selling, general and administrative costs have also risen considerably, going from $8.9 billion in 2018 to $15.3 billion in 2023."", ""Now while it had different operating segments pre-pandemic, what I would call core Disney, such as the parks and product licensing, have seen strong growth and operating margins.

On the media side, linear TV has generally held up fairly well over the past few years, with affiliate fees and even advertising revenue up a bit. However, while streaming has brought in a lot of new revenue, it has been at low margins and an operating loss.', 'On the film side, while revenue in 2023 was down about 9% versus fiscal year 2018, overall production and operating costs were much higher despite the number of big-budget movies it put out into theaters. I would note, however, that amortization does play a role in the those costs and on operating income. That said, 2023 saw a couple of big-budget moves just not perform that well at the box office, including ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" and ""The Marvels.""', 'Now to fix its issues, the company has implemented a restructuring program. It expects to save approximately $7.50 billion a year by the end of fiscal 2024 through the reduction of content spending (excluding sports) and SG&A.

It is also trying to create a soft landing as the transition from linear to streaming continues.', ""ESPN has always had the highest cable carriage fees, which is currently estimated to be over $9 per sub a month. That's about 3 times higher than any other channel, with TNT estimated to get the second-highest carriage fee at $3 per sub. The ever-increasing carriage fees have helped boost the segment despite the continued loss of linear subs from cord-cutting. This dynamic could make a soft landing very difficult to achieve, and is one of the biggest risks facing the company."", 'However, there have been reports that the NFL and ESPN have been in talks about the league taking an equity stake in the network and ESPN taking over NFL Media, which includes the NFL Network. This would be a huge win for EPSN that could make it the sports winner in the streaming age.', 'On the film front, Disney really needs to reignite its Marvel and Star Wars franchises. Superhero movies are still popular, but some recent movies have been considered flops at the box office. Marvel needs to go back to its roots. Meanwhile, Disney does look set to introduce a new Star Wars movie to the big screen based on the success of its Mandalorianseries. ""The Mandalorian & Grogu""could hit theaters in 2026. ', ""Fixing Disney's issues is not going to be easy, but I also would not write off the company just yet. At some point, there needs to be a shake-up in the world of streaming for companies like Disney and Warner Brothers Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD), which I wrote about previously.

It's just a 5% gain away from hitting $100 again. A strong fiscal first-quarter report and making progress in winning its upcoming proxy battle would go a long way to restoring investor support.

Adjusted earnings declined slightly in the fiscal first quarter last year, so another dip isn't a good look."", ""It's easy to see why revenue is likely to inch lower. Disney dominated the box office over the holidays in 2022 with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Avatar: The Way of Water.

The market already knows how Disney struck out at the multiplex, but there's anecdotal evidence that Disney World did see more than just a seasonal uptick in activity over the holidays. The real blowout here would likely come from the bottom line, especially if Disney's direct-to-consumer streaming business takes another big jump on the path to eventual profitability."", ""Iger was able to hold off a proxy battle at last year's annual shareholder meeting, but he has a couple of activist parties to fight this time.

If it's able to post blowout profits next week, it would silence the criticism that it's not doing a good enough job of controlling its costs. Disney's global collection of theme parks should also come through again. You probably also shouldn't sleep on Disney+ raising prices for its premium ad-free formats in October, just in time to push top-line results and the platform's margin higher for the fiscal first quarter."", ""This is an important time for the media stock bellwether, and not just because activists are taking a battering ram to the castle. A lot of its fellow media companies are stumbling in transitioning from cable TV fixtures to premium streaming leaders. Disney seems to be getting it right on that front. It will need to start winning again at the box office, but it doesn't have a potential blockbuster in its arsenal until Memorial Day weekend.

(NYSE: HP) reported net income of $95 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, from operating revenues of $677 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of $78 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, from operating revenues of $660 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The net income per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 include $(0.03) and $0.08 of after-tax losses and gains, respectively, comprised of select items(2). For the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, select items were comprised of:', '$(0.03) of after-tax losses related to the non-cash fair market value adjustments to our equity investments', 'Net cash provided by operating activities was $175 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $215 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.', 'President and CEO John Lindsay commented, ""The Company performed well both operationally and financially during the first fiscal quarter of 2024 despite the persistent volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices. During the quarter, the Company\'s stock price continued to trade as it has historically, with a strong correlation to crude oil prices and industry rig count. Decoupling from these traditional macro measures will require proving our ability to maintain returns above our cost of capital through the cycles, and I believe our fiscal first quarter results are another step in that direction.', '""Expectations for modest incremental rig adds during the quarter were further tempered to some extent by the ongoing churn we are experiencing in the market and, as a result, we exited the December quarter at 151 active rigs, towards the lower end of our guidance range. We expect this churn to continue in the March quarter as E&P budgets are being reset in a relatively weaker commodity price environment, particularly on the natural gas side. From a North America Solutions margin perspective, the Company delivered direct margins that were higher on a sequential basis, indicating that our direct margins, like our rig count, may have experienced a trough during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2023. Looking out, we project our North America Solutions direct margins to remain relatively flat to up slightly during the March quarter.', '""In our International Solutions segment we are very excited regarding recent developments that are tangible proof of our execution on our international expansion strategy. The Company recently received preliminary notification, subject to finalization of contractual agreements, that it has been awarded seven super-spec FlexRigs for work in a drilling campaign in the Middle East. These rigs are expected to commence operations shortly after delivery, which is currently scheduled for the first half of fiscal 2025. Additionally, these rigs will be sourced from our idle super-spec rigs in the U.S., converted to walking configurations, and further equipped to suit contractual specifications. Furthermore, in the Middle East we have been successful in contracting an additional rig in Bahrain. The super-spec rig to be utilized for this work is already located in the region as part of our Middle East hub and it is expected to commence operations during the summer of 2024. These are positive outcomes in our Middle East expansion strategy, and we look forward to further growth in the future.""', 'Senior Vice President and CFO Mark Smith also commented, ""During the quarter, we executed on our fiscal 2024 supplemental shareholder return plan, returning approximately $42 million to shareholders in the form of base and supplemental dividends. Additionally, we exhausted our calendar 2023 share repurchase authorization of 7 million shares by repurchasing roughly 1.3 million shares for approximately $47 million. At the start of the new calendar year, our share repurchase authorization was reset to 4 million shares. These actions demonstrate our prioritization of returning cash to shareholders and highlight our shareholder capital allocation strategy.', '""Given the outlook for a lower level of crude oil production growth in the U.S. in 2024, combined with the recent volatility in commodity prices, we expect our rig count will only grow modestly in fiscal 2024. That is something we had already contemplated as part of our fiscal 2024 capex budget, so we do not currently believe we need to modify our capex plans. We believe current conditions highlight the continued need to remain focused on our NAS margins and reinforce support for the international expansion strategy we are undertaking. Along those lines, the planned capex for the recent seven-rig award was included in our fiscal 2024 capex budget that we announced last October. Furthermore, this award supports our goals of not only expanding internationally, but also reducing the available supply of our idle super-spec rigs in the U.S. market.""', 'John Lindsay concluded, ""Every year in this industry new challenges arise, many resulting from supply and demand dynamics that ultimately result in crude oil and natural gas price volatility. As difficult as it is to manage in these times, we also see these headwinds as opportunities to show-case the exceptional capabilities of our fleet and to demonstrate the value our technology, processes and people bring to providing drilling solutions for our customers. For our part, we will remain focused on our goals and execute toward their achievement in the long-term. Our recent successes on the international front are evidence of this with our announcement of securing work for eight rigs in the Middle East, subject to finalization of contractual agreements. Including the one rig contracted in August 2023, we now have plans to put nine additional rigs to work in the Middle East, which when they begin operations will nearly double our existing international active rig count.""', 'Operating Segment Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024', 'North America Solutions:', 'This segment had operating income of $144.5 million compared to operating income of $128.5 million during the previous quarter.

The company says that steel unit cost reductions will be seen of about $30 per net ton. And they said steel unit costs will further decrease in 2024. But the shares are taking a hit.', 'Remember, there was effectively a bidding war for US steel, one of the four steel majors in the US. And Nippon Steel, a Japanese company, ended up winning that. But Cleveland had been trying to acquire it. So imagine there will be some questions about that strategy, M&A going forward on the call.', 'Same goes for another steel company that reported, that is Nucor. Those shares moving higher by almost 2%. Sales and earnings there beating estimates, $3.16 was what the company reported. $2.88 is what the company-- is what analysts were expecting rather.', ""And the company said earnings in the first quarter will be up sequentially. Steel mills, in particular, will be better in the first quarter because of average selling prices rising. And then let's look at something you make with steel, appliances. Whirlpool numbers out. 2024 outlook disappointing Wall Street. Sales and earnings guidance trailing estimates. And the company is expecting now to further reset its cost structure with an additional $300 million to $400 million of a reduction in costs. Basically, people aren't upgrading appliances at the same rate here."", ""Revenue, it says, will be about $16.9 billion this year. Analysts on that basis had been looking for $17.7 billion.

These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations, and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets, facility-exit costs, acquisition-related charges, net of taxes, restructuring charges, and certain non-recurring tax expenses and benefits, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure of non-GAAP net income is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the Company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the Company’s tax liability.', ""The non-GAAP adjustments, and F5's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:"", 'Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation consists of expense for stock options, restricted stock, and employee stock purchases through the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of F5’s employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of the Company’s core business and to facilitate comparison of the Company’s results to those of peer companies.', 'Amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. On a non-recurring basis, when certain events or circumstances are present, management may also be required to write down the carrying value of its purchased intangible assets and recognize impairment charges. Management does not believe these charges accurately reflect the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations; therefore, they are not considered by management in making operating decisions. However, investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to F5’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to F5’s future period revenues as well.', 'Facility-exit costs. F5 has incurred certain non-recurring right-of-use asset impairment charges, and other related recurring costs in connection with the exit of its leased facilities. These charges are not representative of the ongoing activity or costs to the business. As a result, these charges are being excluded to provide investors with a more comparable measure of costs associated with ongoing operations.', 'Acquisition-related charges, net. F5 does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and the terms and scope of each transaction can vary significantly and are unique to each transaction. F5 excludes acquisition-related charges from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of the Company’s operating results to prior periods and to its peer companies. Acquisition-related charges consist of planning, execution and integration costs incurred directly as a result of an acquisition.', 'Restructuring charges. F5 has incurred restructuring charges that are included in its GAAP financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and costs associated with exiting facility-lease commitments. F5 excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.', 'Management believes that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the Company’s core business operations and facilitates comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results. Although F5’s management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the core business, management’s reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5’s earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5’s management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the Company’s core business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.', 'F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measures of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the Company’s core business and is used by management in its own evaluation of the Company’s performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the Company provides investors these supplemental measures since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the Company’s operational performance and financial results.', 'For reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section in our attached Condensed Consolidated Income Statements entitled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures.""', 'About F5', 'F5 is a multi-cloud application services and security company committed to bringing a better digital world to life.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b F5 partners with the world’s largest, most advanced organizations to secure and optimize every app and API anywhere—on premises, in the cloud, or at the edge.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases."", 'Colgate-Palmolive in Focus', ""Based in New York, Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is in the Consumer Staples sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 3.91%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.48 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.32%. In comparison, the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry's yield is 2.44%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.6%."", ""In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 0.5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Colgate-Palmolive has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 2.88%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Colgate-Palmolive's current payout ratio is 59%. This means it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Looking at this fiscal year, CL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $3.47 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 7.43%.', 'Bottom Line', 'Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', ""Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that CL is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy)."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The remainder of this information will be available on a recorded version of this call or on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Harshman. Patrick."", ""Well, thanks, David, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter call. For today, we reported our fourth quarter and full year results, wrapping up 2023 with another quarter of solid performance, including record total company revenue, driven by continuing strong demand for our market-leading broadband and video streaming solutions key highlights for the quarter included record broadband revenue, demonstrating our broadband business remains firmly on track for sustained multiyear growth. Record video SaaS revenue exceeding $50 million for the year, powered by growing sports streaming success and execution of a new 100, $60 million credit facility enhancing our financial flexibility.We also delivered strong new bookings during the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.2 ending 2023 with over $653 million of backlog and deferred revenue and positioning us well for 2024 in the coming years.So moving now to our broadband segment. We delivered segment revenue of $115.2 million, up 52% sequentially and 20% year over year the number of global customers supplying our solution reached 108 of 19% year over year with corresponding 26.3 million boxes. Cable modems now served worldwide approximately 15% of cable modems deployed globally, again, highlighting the substantial Docsis growth opportunity still in front of us. We had several new customer wins during the fourth quarter, including a new top 10 North American operator for whom we made initial shipments. Our pipeline of new customers remained strong, bolstered by the expanding breadth and depth of our competitive advantages. An important area of expanding competitive differentiation for Harmonic is not just for data or software core has seamlessly accommodate to the new standard as have our remote five edge device designs for successfully powering several early Docsis for Datto deployments launched late in the year, and we are uniquely positioned as the go-to partner for any operator planning and Docsis for that will launch full-scale deployment in 2024 for 2025.As a reminder, our Docsis four nodes are fully backward compatible with Docsis 3.1.So that availability of Docsis for RF amplifiers is not a requirement for any operator who chooses to go forward and deploy harmonics for data capable nodes in 2024. And we expect at least one key customer to make a big move to Docsis for data-enabled edge devices during 2024, leading to a slower pace of deployment early in the year. As for data, no deployment expertise scales up, followed by a heavier deployment pace in the second half.Another important aspect of our broadband business is that we had greater revenue diversification during the fourth quarter with both Comcast and Charter contributing greater than 10% of our revenue from different places in their respective DA architecture deployment journeys. We're grateful to be working with both of these industry leaders and are incredibly focused on supporting the respective strategic initiatives, augmenting our growing multi-year pipeline of Docsis opportunities.We also continue to make solid progress during the fourth quarter on building a synergistic fiber-to-the-home business. In the fourth quarter, we secured several new fiber customer wins spanning existing cable and non-cable fiber first operators. We also announced a couple of compelling new fiber products that significantly expand our addressed market and our ability to compete with incumbent fiber to the home competitors. Early customer response to these new products has been very encouraging. We're ramping up our fiber specialist sales team, and we remain very much on track to make fiber a strong strategic and financial contributor to our business.So in summary, on broadband, our broadband business continues to be well positioned with unique and powerful technology advantages, solid customer relationships, strong backlog, and a rich array of new business opportunities that give us confidence that our multiyear growth outlook. We finished 2023 with solid execution and considering our customers' positive feedback, we're confident in our ability to carry this strong execution forward through 2024 and beyond.So turning now to our Video segment. The highlight of the quarter was again, SaaS revenue $13.2 million, up 26% year over year. Total segment revenue was $51.9 million, down from $68.3 million a year ago, while gross margin was a record 64.6%. These results reflect our continued intentional SaaS transformation and some macroeconomic headwinds overseas impacting our clients' business. As mentioned previously, SaaS revenue for the year topped $50 million, up about 47% year over year, mainly driven by streaming sports live sports. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see existing customers, expand usage and new customers adopt and begin to launch services with our SaaS solution. This positive momentum has carried into 2024. Earlier this month, our SaaS powered the largest live streaming event ever in the US, a testament to our exceptional technology and service capabilities.The market. Visibility of this extremely successful event has already translated into additional boost by an additional boost to our sales says sales pipeline. A targeted ad monetization is key to the rationale for moving live content, especially live sports to streaming. And it's an important adjacent growth opportunity for us. As you may recall, we rolled out a new ad insertion sales earlier in 2023. And it was great to see several initial wins with this new service during the fourth quarter.On the appliance side of the business, which, as a reminder, is more capital intensive for our customers. We saw revenue stabilize despite several continuing instances of project delays associated with financing and other macroeconomic headwinds, particularly internationally, where domestic video appliance business remained solid as does our overall pipeline and competitive position.Finally, regarding video, our strategic review process is ongoing and continues to be a very high priority for us. Walter will speak more about this shortly.So in conclusion, we ended 2023 on a solid note and with a robust backlog. This highlights the continued demand we're seeing from our customers and the strong footing we have for further growth in 2024 and beyond. With that, let me turn it over to Walter for a deeper discussion of our results and outlook."", ""Thanks, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. Before I discuss our quarterly results as well as our outlook, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results I'll be referring to are provided on a non-GAAP basis. As David mentioned earlier, our Q4 press release and earnings presentation includes reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP that are discussed on this call. Both of these are available on our website.Our fourth quarter results were consistent with our expectations and above the midpoint of our guidance range on the top as well as the bottom line. Additionally, we exceeded the midpoint of revenue guidance in both broadband and video.Before reviewing our Q4 2023 financials in detail, I'll call out some highlights here on Slide 7. For the quarter, we reported revenue of $167.1 million, which was an all-time Company record and included record broadband revenue of 115.2 million. We also reported EPS of $0.13 bookings of 196.5 million, a strong book-to-bill of 1.2 and near record backlog and deferred revenue of 653.2 million. In a few moments, I will provide detailed Q1 and full year 2024 guidance prior to that I'd like to highlight a few key points regarding our guidance for our broadband business. We expect full year 2024 revenue to increase 24% year over year at the midpoint of our guidance. Based on the momentum we expect to see in the second half of 2024, we anticipate 2025 broadband revenue growth to accelerate on a year-over-year basis. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we are well positioned with our leading technologies, strong backlog and our customer success to drive continued multiyear growth.With regards to video, we are guiding conservatively for FY24 due to the ongoing strategic review.Turning to Slide 8. Total Q4 revenue was up nearly 2% year over year and 31.4% on a sequential basis. This quarter-over-quarter increase was due to growth in our broadband segment.Looking more closely at broadband, Q4 revenue was a record $115.2 million, an increase of 20% year over year. As anticipated, during the fourth quarter, we benefited from the initial shipments of another large Tier one customer in video, Q4 revenue was $51.9 million, while video appliance sales were lower. Due to the factors I noted on our last earnings call, video revenue included SaaS revenue of $13.2 million or 25.4% of segment revenue for the quarter, up 26% from the prior year. Video SaaS revenue growth continues to be driven by live sports streaming expansions and new customer wins. We continue to focus on growing our SaaS business and video while maximizing our profitability and implied in appliances. Despite current macroeconomic headwinds, in our last earnings call, we announced the initiation of a formal strategic review process for our video business due in part to indications of interest we had received from a number of parties. We are continuing the strategic review process and it remains a top priority for us.Having said that, as previously noted, no specific timetable has been established for the completion of the review. We are not providing any further details on this process unless and until a definitive agreement has been reached and our Board approves that transaction or decides to conclude the review.Turning back to our fourth quarter results, we had two customers representing greater than 10% of total revenue during the quarter, with Comcast representing 41% of total revenue and charter representing 15% of total revenue. Total Company gross margin was 49.3% for Q4 23, reflecting decreased gross margin in the broadband business segment sequentially. Broadband gross margin was 42.4% for Q4 23, down 520 basis points year over year due to product mix to offer additional clarity during Q4, we shipped out an extremely high mix of Edge products. It possesses relatively lower margins compared to other products in our portfolio. Video gross margin was 64.6% in Q4 23, an all-time record for the business segment, even taking into consideration today's macroeconomic headwinds and project delays that we've discussed previously. This margin improvement occurred across both SaaS and appliances.Moving down the income statement on slide 9, Q4 23 operating expenses were $63.4 million, up slightly, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 23 was $21.7 million, comprised of $21.9 million from broadband and negative $0.2 million from video adjusted EBITDA for broadband was in line with our expectations, while video beat our expectations due in part to the gross margin strength previously discussed. This all translated into Q4 23 EPS of $0.13 per share, in line with our prior guidance and compared with $0 in Q3 23 and $0.17 per share for Q4 22. We ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with a calculated diluted weighted average share count of $115.7 million compared to $116.7 million in Q three 23 and $117.3 million in Q4 22. The sequential decrease is primarily due to the decreased convertible debt dilution of 1.1 million shares.Turning to the order book, Q4 bookings were 196.5 million. The book-to-bill ratio was strong at 1.2 for the quarter for both Q. three, 23 and Q4 22. Our book-to-bill ratios were 0.8. As we stated previously over time, we expect this ratio to normalize and approach the historical benchmark of greater than one. For Q4, we were above one after being below one last quarter.Turning to the balance sheet on slide 10, we ended Q4 23 with cash of 84.3 million. The net 2.3 million sequential increase in cash and short-term investments was due to a few factors. Cash from operations provided $6.3 million due predominantly to a decrease in inventory and inventory related deposits, offset by an increase in accounts receivable. We also used $2.7 million in the purchase of fixed assets.Turning to accounts receivables and days sales outstanding at the end of Q4 23, DSO was 76 compared to 78 in Q three 23 and 59 in the prior year period. Prior year period was lower due to a large customer taking an early payment discount days. Inventory on hand was 89 days at the end of Q4 23 compared to 145 at the end of Q3 23 of 140 at the end of Q4 22. The inventory decline in the quarter was a result of strong sales in Q4 and lower end feed as we continue to tighten our supply chain.Turning to capital allocation, our top priority remains driving our future growth. When appropriate, we will strategically invest in building inventory as we've done in the past to meet strong demand in line with this strategy in December, we closed a five-year $160 million credit facility that included a $120 million revolving credit line and a $40 million delayed draw term loan. This new credit facility allows us to repay our 2024 convertible notes outstanding while providing us with ample liquidity and flexibility to support our multiyear growth plan as of today, we have not borrowed on this facility tomorrow, Tuesday, January 30th, we will issue a notice to holders to redeem the entire 115.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2024 convertible notes. As a result, holders of the convertible notes will have the right to convert their notes to shares of Harmonic common stock. Under the terms of the indenture, we elected to settle any such conversions by paying cash equal to the principal amount and delivering common stock for any conversion value over par we expect to use our credit facility and cash on hand to fund the cash portion of the redemption and complete the redemption in Q2 of this year. Additionally, with our enhanced liquidity position, we intend to step up our stock buybacks available under our current authorization of $100 million, of which 5 million has been used to date. With that in mind, we plan to prudently manage our balance sheet by maintaining overall net leverage of around two times or less and available liquidity of no less than $100 million going forward.In summary, due to the actions we've taken to strengthen our balance sheet, we believe we have sufficient available liquidity to continue funding our growth plans while returning capital to our shareholders through increased stock repurchases. As we said previously, the timing and amount of any stock repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of Harmonic's common stock market conditions, corporate needs and regulatory requirements. At the end of Q4, total backlog and deferred revenue was $653.2 million. Our strong backlog reflects continued demand from our large broadband customers and growing video SaaS commitments, just over 50% of our backlog and deferred revenue at customer request dates for shipments of products and for providing services within the next 12 months. Lastly, we generated $3.5 million in free cash flow during the quarter.Before reviewing guidance, I would like to mention that given the ongoing strategic review process, we've decided to hold off on setting a date for the next analyst day. We expect to revisit this in the future.Let's now review our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter beginning on slide 11, we expect broadband to deliver revenue between 70 to $80 million, reflecting a technology transition at one of our one of our largest customers gross margins between 46% to 47% due to product mix. Gross profit between 32 to $38 million and adjusted EBITDA between 4 to 8 million for the full year, we expect revenue between 460 to $500 million, gross margins between 46.5% to 48.5%. Gross profit between 214 to $243 million and adjusted EBITDA between 95 to 119 million. For broadband, we expect to see a return to top line growth in the second half of the year and the potential to hit record quarterly revenue during that timeframe. Today's guidance and wider range also reflects anticipated shifts in the timing of certain project deployments related to customers that are transitioning to new technologies. In 2025, we expect our growth rate to accelerate from 2024 levels as our larger customers ramp up their spend levels in the second half of 2024, which should build greater momentum as we enter 2025 for our video segment in Q1.On Slide 12, we expect revenue in the range of 40 to $50 million gross margin in the range of 60% to 61%. Gross profit in the range of 24 to $31 million and adjusted EBITDA to range from negative $8 million to negative $2 million. For the full year, we expect revenue between $195 million to $210 million, gross margins between 60% to 62%, gross profit between 117 to $130 million and adjusted EBITDA to range from negative $7 million to positive $2 million for video. We continue to be conservative, reflecting the ongoing strategic review and other macro economic factors I mentioned earlier.Turning to slide 13, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect total company revenue in the range of 110 to $130 million, gross margin in the range of 51.1% to 52.4%, gross profit to range from 56 to $69 million adjusted EBITDA to range from negative $4 million to positive $6 million weighted average diluted share count of 111.7 million to 115.2 million and EPS to range from a loss of $0.06 to a profit of $0.02. And for the full year, we expect revenue between $655 million to $710 million, gross margins between 50.5% to 52.5%, gross profit between $331 million to $373 million, adjusted EBITDA between 88 to $121 million, a weighted average diluted share count of 114.6 million and EPS to range from $0.49 to $0.72.In summary, we reported solid fourth quarter results, including record total company and broadband segment revenue. We believe our broadband segment continues to be well positioned for future growth. In addition, our Video segment continued its strategic transformation and shift to SaaS during the fourth quarter. Thank you, everyone, for your attention today and now I'll turn it back to Patrick for final remarks before we open up the call for questions."", ""So thanks, Walter. In summary, as Walter just said, Harmonic delivered another strong quarter capping a year of solid financial and operational execution. Despite industry-wide challenges, the company continues to be exceptionally well positioned for sustained growth and create greater value for our shareholders. We remain focused and confident in our ability to execute, and we appreciate your confidence in us for that. Let's now open up the call for some questions. Thank you."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Simon Leopold, Raymond James.', ""Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. And I'm just sort of trying to figure out a little bit more of what's going on within this broadband segment in that when I sort of couple your first quarter revenue guidance with the full year, it would appear that the second quarter back half of the year really expand dramatically from this first quarter. And I'm trying to get an understanding of what what you're assuming for that to happen. And I'll be explicit, you may not be in your answer, but we recall last earnings period charter talked about delaying some of its upgrades by perhaps six months. And we know Comcast has started deploying doctors for Datto, but some of your language in the prepared remarks sounded like you were making references to some slower aspects of the Ford auto. So I'm just trying to discern what the real driver is and what the pattern might be through the year."", ""Thank you, Simon. I'll start that. And then ask Patrick to jump in as well. Let me first start by identifying how our guidance is set up and address those two points that you've brought up and definitely from a Q1 standpoint, you see where our guidance is. The expectation is we returned to growth year on year growth in the second half of Q3 Q4.What is giving us confidence in terms of providing that full year guidance is predicated on two things. One is based on our backlog and contracts that we have with with our customers. But more importantly, with regards to the recent conversations that we've been having with key customers in terms of their deployment plans in 2024. And so the guidance reflects the information, the latest information that we have by working with our customers to identify the technology transitions when they expect to ramp, and that's reflected in the guidance.In regards to some of the two technologies specifically definitely there's a customer's ramping up and moving over to Ford auto, and that's going to take some deployment time, as Patrick mentioned earlier.And with regards to our other customer, that's ramping up. I mentioned the alignment with regards to the plans and the deployment plans that that customer has. Patrick, would you like to add?"", ""Yes, I think I think you've covered it but I'll ask Simon as such clear, if you have any more specific follow-up on."", ""Actually I've got a different follow-up, and this is just much more of the sort of broader topic in net, you highlighted sort of the 15% coverage today. We know Comcast has been working at its own initiative for about four years. That's backwards looking if you were to sort of take a look at the what's in front of you and your pipeline. Can you give us sort of your thinking of how many years this cycle should last for you?"", ""Well, I think it is a tough question, Simon, but I mean a top-level answer is certainly another four to five years. You've kind of got some some crosscurrents. On one hand, we are customers in the market have learned a lot. So the deployment pace today can and should be much faster than it was when this whole initiative started four years ago.On the other hand, as we all have seen, some customers are just inclined for a variety of reasons to move more slowly, particularly with regards to getting the programs up and running. So you've got both of those things kind of ongoing somewhat offsetting themselves.So in summary, I expect the pace going forward to be slightly faster than the pace that we've seen to date, but not dramatically.So.And I think that that sets us up for four, five, six plus strong years of investment and opportunity in this area."", 'Great. Thank you for taking the question.', 'Thanks, Simon.', 'Operator', 'Ryan Coates, Needham & Company.', 'Ryan, thanks for the question. If you could just step back also and talk about your North American Tier ones. Obviously were familiar with Comcast and your win at Charter, but without naming names Can you refresh us on where we are with the North America Tier ones that you have wins with maybe without naming names, but talking about them in generality?', 'Sure, Ryan.', ""We from what I think we previously stated that actually out of the top five, we've received some kind of order or some level of business with the top three. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we won another top 10 just this past quarter. So our coverage is not 100%, but Jim is now over 50%. And each of those customers is moving forward with a different set of priorities, different paces. And to date, frankly, out of the the two biggest names, I think the pace has been a little bit slower than we would have expected if you roll the clock back a year or two ago, but we see growing signs of some of that improvement. One of the things that's kept some folks on the sideline, as you know, has been a question about taxes for different variants of that technology and the success that we're seeing rolling that out. I think is being very well received by the market. Both existing customers were trying to figure out exactly how to move forward as well as prospective customers who are kind of waiting for the right, a stepping off point. And so the momentum is strong."", ""The position is strong.There are a couple of additional accounts to win and done, and there's a lot of really good work ahead of us and plans actively being worked with customers have yet to really start scaling in earnest.That's super helpful, Patrick, thank you."", 'And maybe double-clicking on your comment there around Docsis four, and I know in your prepared remarks you mentioned amplifier supply and these sort of things.', ""Can you unpack that a little bit for us there in terms of your assumptions go into your your docks for migration in terms of dependence on other things that you can't control will be the Broadcom chips, whatever?Yes. So with so ramps up, right. So I appreciate the question, and we were trying to run to illuminate that a little bit more are indeed for a customer to turn on an end-to-end Docsis for system. Other things need to be in place, deductions for modem and most architectures. Some we have some kind of Docsis for amplifier, et cetera. However, the important thing to understand is that our new Docsis for old technology can be run in a Docsis three.one mode. So if you're a customer and you got to deploy, you know, I'll make it up in Akron, Ohio, you not you may not be ready with the modem and the RF amplifiers, but you may nonetheless choose to buy Docsis four capable nodes now rather than quote unquote, regrettable spend touches three one limited notes if that makes sense. So we're seeing some rethinking of buy by customers, and we're definitely not seeing in all cases, purchasing or in planning and deployment of our Docsis photodiode capable technology being in any way limited by the broader ecosystem. And so that kind of brings us full circle to one large customer has decided to really pivot almost fully what they're deploying with us to the Docsis Ford auto version. I think that's great. It takes advantage of our new technology and really further strengthens our position in the short term, as you can see from our guidance. And as we just discussed with Simon, this does mean we've kind of got a of a little bit funny shape to the curve, a slower first half, followed by what we think is going to be a very aggressive second half, um, and and But net-net, it it doesn't diminish the total opportunity and it certainly does not put us on the sidelines waiting for any other third party or product or element of the solution as I presented clear our healthcare.Yes, that's perfect, Patrick. Thank you. And with regards to your Docsis four, is any of the second-half low, is it more dependent on your customers' demand or your own supply chain holding things up there in terms of the second half weight on broadband, specifically regarding data score, it's more about our customers. I mean that being said, it's a good question. I mean, the fact is we could not ship not just for data and infinite quantities today, even if we wanted to. So frankly, we're all in a kind of a ramp up of the supply chain of the deployment experience to match duration, et cetera. So everything is converging, but I think if you have to point to something that could be a limiting factor. It's more on the on the demand side. We feel quite good about where we are with the technology and then we're going to be in good shape to see to them to supply quite heavy demand in the second half."", ""And in fact, as you've heard from Walter, that is our plan."", 'Right.', 'Thank you, sir.', 'Thanks.', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Steven Frankel, Rosenblatt. Please go ahead.', 'And Steven.', 'Good afternoon, Patrick.', ""Let's talk about the other set of customers. There were a large number of customers entering SCTE. that hadn't really figured out their deployment plans on a where are we with those? And how big a percentage of that group is likely in the four old camp and so they're going to be back half weighted as well?"", ""Yes, that's right, Steve. It's an excellent question, an excellent point, but there is not on it. Certainly domestically, there is not a significant cable operator, who is not contemplating on taxes for at least part of their strategy. And so it is part of the dialogue with everyone, and it is part of the dynamic, you know, for better or worse. And again, what we're talking about here is not the scale of the opportunity. In fact, not just FARO expands the opportunity from our perspective, but it does have certain implications on the on the timing for all the reasons we've just discussed. And indeed, while I'd say the typical, let's say midsize operator is still probably has three, one more central to their near-term plans. Our understanding and figuring out their FARO strategy, particularly for their most competitive areas, is some is mission critical for them and it's very much core to the planning and discussions with us and to the anticipated scaling indeed, as you said, pushing things a little bit more back half this year."", ""Okay. And then on the fiber business, maybe a little more color on the progress you're making with and new opportunities in the pure fiber area well, I mean, for us, it's all new opportunity, Steve."", ""I mean, as I mentioned, we've won quite a bit of business with some significant existing cable accounts, but actually very often within those accounts."", ""It's a different team."", ""This could be a team dealing with business services, um, um, services, to MDUs as well as the groups who are expanding the footprint, the so-called Edge-Out activity, acquiring new homes passed. And so we're making good progress there. We've had a couple of very significant design wins. Last year was actually quite a good year from a particularly new order input point of view. One of the things we discovered, particularly internationally though, was that there was a couple of holes in the product line. For instance, we focused on 10G initially. And there's a number of accounts that are really also looking for complementary one gig solution, still legacy solution. So we've added some capabilities around that really, um, I think bullet proofing our offering and giving us a more complete end-to-end solution and for domestic and international operators. And this is looking at both cable as well as new."", ""Let's say, traditional telecom or fiber first operators."", ""And we're also excited about the progress we're making there with those new non-cable accounts against several good wins late last year and a pretty strong pipeline and actually it's going after those accounts."", ""That's one of the key areas of focus for us in terms of scaling up our go-to-market capability in which you remind us how many fiber first customers on you have today?"", ""I don't think we've quoted that and I think that's not a metric we want to get into, but it's some it's more than just several about that."", 'Okay. Great.', 'Thank you.Okay, thanks.Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of George Notter of Jefferies. Your question please, George.', 'Hi, guys.', ""Thanks very much, Pete, if I go back to last quarter, I think there was a conversation about the customers carrying excess inventory on I guess I was thinking about it more in the context of Comcast, but could you give us a sense for what that looks like? Did that inventory get burned off here in Q4 or is that still something that's kind of lingering going forward."", ""Now in terms of what we talked about last year, George, in terms of orders that got pushed out, those orders were fulfilled in Q4. That was part of the impact you would see there on inventory, for example, the reduction in inventory. So we were holding inventory that was ready to go a couple of quarters ago. And we've now flush that out in in Q4."", 'Got it. Okay.', 'And then also what about inventory that is in possession of your customers on is there is there a comment on that as well?', ""No specific comment, George, in terms of having direct access to see exactly what's in their pipeline in terms of lead at the three, 3.1 nodes or or four, 4.0 is just getting started on. So there's very little inventory in the pipeline because that's just the getting getting started now."", 'Got it.', 'Okay.', ""So is that is that part of the narrative here that as you see customers transition from three one to 4 row from your business trends are softer now because they're adjusting inventories or is in fact that it's a different skew them that they're buying as they deploy for O.? Or how do I think about how the customer is approaching their own inventories of your product as they go through this transition?"", ""Yes, certainly, George, as well as Patrick mentioned earlier, with regards to deployment around for Dato notes and their backward compatibility in terms of ability to put those notes in place in the network and not to regret putting the three one and having to go back in short order and upgraded to a four point of note so I think we're seeing a level of planning around that as customers look at how they are going to leverage our for Dato notes that have that backward compatibility. So I think that's a big driver in terms of the technology transition specifically to for Dato."", ""Got it up for you. Is that a different skew that you're selling into a customer like a like a Comcast of certainly a forte for Dato is a different skews and then three.one."", ""Yes, George, it's a different hardware design. It's a different court trip. It's a different RF design to support the some of the deductions for capability. So for the edge devices, it is a different hardware design and it's also additional some incremental love a capability and functionality on the software, the core software piece.Got it, right."", ""And I guess the question I'm asking is and is that a source of the softness that you see here in the first part of the year on your customers depleting any remaining inventory of three one nodes in advance of cutting over to four."", ""So it's part of the story I don't think it's the whole story, but for one customer in particular, George, it's a big part of the story.Yes, if you if you're gearing up for for oh, you're not only just rightsizing your inventory, you're actually bleeding your legacy inventory down a hard, right.And we have another significant customer that for their own reasons is is just the natural curve of their ramp up is is still, I'd say, ramping up moderately through the first half and kind of hitting the knee of the curve sometime in Q2 and really getting to a much heavier pace of deployment in Q three and Q4. That's a customer who's relatively newer to deployment, and that's consistent with what we've seen in the past with other customers who are in their, let's say, 1st year of major rollouts. So we've kind of got two separate things working at the same time and coincidentally, both following the same kind of lighter first half stronger second half curve kind of multiplying the effect.That makes sense. That helps."", 'Thank you guys very much. Thank you, Richard.', 'David Hanover', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Tim Savageaux, Northland.', ""Thanks, and good afternoon. A question is on kind of the nature of your initial ramp with Charter, I guess and what you might expect going forward? And I guess I want to come at that from a couple of directions. First, you saw weaker gross margins in Q4. Go. Do we infer that that's a hardware, heavy initial mix or some kind of stocking or there is a relationship there at all on remembering that you had a big upfront software license with Comcast that initial deployment and then relative to And assuming that most of the charter revenue is vast majority is broadband and really wasn't much in any of anything last quarter. How would you relate that ramp to what you saw historically with Comcast. And then I can remember times when you were at similar levels and on up to doing $50 million to $60 million a quarter, probably on the broadband side. So when you talk about that second half ramp, should we think about have those types of metrics to China and you define what you mean? We'll start with Charter in particular."", ""Again, that's Walter. So we're not going to specifically talk about any particular customers ramp, but I think there's a couple of things there that that you've asked that we'll address. First of all in regards to the margins for for Q4 in broadband specifically. So as we highlighted in our opening remarks, we had a significant high or mix of nodes go out in the Q4 time period more than we had anticipated going into the quarter. Part of that was other customers who came in with orders that they wanted fulfilled in the quarter. And so we prioritize that. And so when we look at our mix of business, our heavy mix of nodes in Q4 and that drove down the broadband margin compared to what we've seen historically.Second point that I will highlight here in terms of how to think about the margin profile as we move forward across the customer base, as we look at customers come in in terms of moving forward, our customers acquire the nodes, they acquire licenses, software licenses to enable those nodes. Once those get the put put into the network. And so as we've highlighted before and quarter to quarter, the margins will fluctuate depending on the mix over a longer period of time, such as a year, you average those puts and takes, and you'll see more of a normalized mix of the COS., coupled with with the nodes that are going out in in broadband.So I addressed a couple of your questions."", ""Tim, is there maybe there's something I missed from from the ones that you listed out here?"", 'Yes, some of it.', ""Yes, I think so as a follow-up question. You mentioned the prospects for an accelerating growth rate in 25 as new customers kind of get ramped up. Can you offer any kind of commentary you mentioned over a year for gross margins or normalized, you're guiding into the high 40s, let's say, 47, something like that, um, as as the business scales, if we're looking at 25 is 50% on the table from a gross margin perspective or do you expect the hardware mix to be heavy enough for that?This range is a reasonable range to expect where we are currently today."", 'A good question, Tim.', ""The way I would look at FY 24, it's a transitional year with regards to a lot of nodes that are going out into into the networks as we look forward beyond on 2024, I would say that the mix will likely be slightly improved in terms of the mix of our COS. as compared to to our hardware. But there, as you can imagine, there are many factors and some of the ones that Patrick highlighted earlier with regards to our our focus around fiber as well. That has an impact in terms of the the overall margins for the business."", 'Okay.', 'Thanks very much.', 'Okay.', 'Thanks, Tim.', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'I would now like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Harshman for closing remarks.', ""Well, thank you again for joining us today, and we're pleased with our strong quarter and we're excited about the opportunities ahead of us, and we're determined to execute in 2024, 2025 and beyond."", 'We appreciate your support.', ""We're confident in our ability to execute, and we look forward to continuing to be in close dialogue with you as we go forward.

And this is pretty staggering.', '""Suits"" acquiring the most views of all time, even surpassing ""The Office."" Almost 60 billion total minutes watched in 2023. That puts it just ahead of the 57.1 billion minutes of viewership that ""The Office"" acquired in 2020. And it just shows that you can really have TV series that were on years ago-- I mean, ""Suits"" debuted in 2011-- now getting this new life on platforms like Netflix.', ""And Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos, he has said multiple times that they want to continue licensing from competitors. He splashed cold water on the idea of wanting to license their own original content. We'll see if that changes down the line, because you could potentially be leaving a lot of money on the table. And I think that's something that at a certain point media companies across the board are going to have to weigh. Should we be licensing our content? Should we be keeping it in order to have more engagement? It's going to be a battle."", 'JOSH SCHAFER: To me, the biggest takeaway from this is, a, yes, how do you recreate ""Suits,"" but how do you not go fishing and say the wrong place for some of these shows, too, right? Like I think ""Suits"" has the right characteristics of something that works. It\'s kind of timeless, it\'s fun, it\'s light. It doesn\'t really-- I don\'t know, it\'s not a lot of the other shows that people are streaming right now. I think like we stream a lot of good dramas, right, and really intense kind of shows. And ""Suits"" for me, I was one of the people that streamed it on Netflix. And it was like just fun.', 'Like, it was just like a fun show. And it\'s like, how do you find shows like that? I know ""Sex in the City"" I think is coming to Netflix, that might fit that bill maybe.', 'PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I think, you know, we talk about 21 million years of streaming just this year alone, just in that report. Netflix has almost all of that. Over the last 10 years, they have so much data that they know what shows can really hit from a casual viewer, library content, right. You mentioned-- you mentioned ""Suits."" Years ago, it was ""Friends,"" right? And then what\'s next? And what\'s next is ""Sex in the City."" I mean, that\'s like what you said, a nice lighthearted casual watching, put it on the background. Maybe, I mean, if anyone knows what\'s going to work, I think they know, right?', ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: And they know their subscriber, too.

Yet, these institutions face systemic challenges in accumulating substantial endowments, a crucial factor for ensuring institutional stability and growth. A new study launched by UNCF (United Negro College Fund) and PGIM, the global asset management business of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE: PRU), explores these challenges and how the asset management industry can work with HBCUs to achieve better outcomes.', '""Investing in Change: A Call to Action for Strengthening Private HBCU Endowments,"" details the perspectives of endowment professionals from nearly one-third of all private HBCUs gathered through a comprehensive online survey. Additionally, HBCU endowment professionals participated in a focus group, providing deeper insights into their experiences and the ways in which they use their resources to uplift students and their communities.', 'The study makes clear that private HBCUs have far fewer resources than non-HBCUs when it comes to overseeing their endowment portfolios — placing limitations on how they are able to use their endowment, manage risk and make asset allocation decisions.', '""Our hope is that this research initiates critical conversations about how to level the playing field for HBCU endowments and how asset managers can engage with these vital institutions to help them meet their long-term goals,"" said Sancia Dalley, managing director and head of PGIM’s DEI Portfolio and HBCU Investment Strategy. ""PGIM’s work with HBCUs and UNCF is one way we can help fuel an ecosystem that is already producing a strong talent pool of future professionals for our industry.""', '""HBCUs have, for centuries, pursued their missions without the endowment resources afforded to their counterparts.

We’re proud to partner with Prudential and its asset management business PGIM on this study and look forward to our continued strong partnership.""', 'Key Findings', 'The study indicates four main constraints for HBCU endowment professionals tied to lack of funding and the comparably small size of their endowments:', 'Smaller HBCU endowments limit infrastructure and capabilities. Eighty-six percent of the private HBCU institutions in the survey use their endowment predominantly to fund scholarships, with little budget left to support other essential needs.', 'HBCUs steward their endowment with significantly fewer investment management resources. Private HBCUs on average have only one internal investment management professional, often as part of a broader role, compared to an average of six internal investment staff at non-HBCUs.', 'HBCUs are substantially more risk-averse than non-HBCUs. Currently, a modest majority of HBCU respondents (63%) classify their risk tolerance as moderate, with the remainder preferring a more conservative approach. Only 13% of private HBCUs have specific resources allocated to risk management activities, significantly lower than the 54% of non-HBCUs that do.', 'HBCUs have smaller alternatives allocations than non-HBCUs. On average, private HBCUs are holding about 27% less of their portfolio in alternative asset classes compared to non-HBCUs (14% vs. 41%). These differences suggest HBCUs may benefit from more sophisticated liquidity management tools and processes, as well as a higher risk tolerance, to optimize their long-term returns.', 'Opportunities for engagement with HBCUs', 'The asset management industry is well-positioned to help HBCUs with these challenges:', 'Offering investor education and access to innovative investments and diversification solutions: Most private HBCU endowments point to both of these areas as avenues that could enhance their investment outcomes.', 'Sharing risk management expertise: There is a significant need for advanced risk management support among HBCUs, especially to navigate macroeconomic challenges, including interest rate and inflation risks.', 'Providing portfolio management oversight: Collaborating with experienced partners could guide HBCUs toward adopting moderately higher risk tolerances and increasing allocations to alternative asset classes.', 'Supporting endowment pooling initiatives: The smaller assets of HBCUs limit their access to investment opportunities available to well-capitalized institutions. Many private HBCUs (44%) are interested in pooling their endowments, which could provide shared resources and improved investment insights.', 'The PGIM and UNCF study is part of Prudential’s broader HBCU strategy to support HBCU leadership, faculty and students, aimed at increasing access and exposure to the financial services and investment management industries. Since 1978, Prudential has provided more than $1.4 billion to help eliminate barriers to financial and social mobility for underserved and underrepresented populations.', '""Brilliance exists in every area of our society, but access to the tools and resources needed to thrive is often a barrier,"" said Kathy Sayko, PGIM’s chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer.

Apple’s entire supply chain is based in China and much of its incremental revenue growth also comes from China, so if there is a U.S.-China issue that makes it more difficult for U.S.-based companies that have access to large amounts of local data to operate in China, Apple’s business would likely face more challenges than many others. In addition, much of Apple’s services growth and margin expansion has come from direct payments from Google to be the default search provider on iOS devices. This practice is currently the subject of a lawsuit between Google and the U.S. Justice Department. If this practice is deemed unlawful, it could take away a large and highly profitable revenue stream from Apple’s already slow growth engine.

Last year customers spent close to $1.5 trillion on the American Express card network, leading to $33.4 billion in transaction revenue, or 55% of American Express's consolidated revenue."", 'It grows transaction volume by consistently acquiring new customers to sign up for its various credit cards. Last quarter it activated 2.9 million new cards, and has added around 3 million new cards to the American Express network each quarter since the beginning of 2022. Importantly, a lot of this growth is coming from younger millennial and Gen Z customers. Transaction revenue from these two age groups grew 15% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023.', ""There are a lot of competitors issuing credit cards, including all of the big banks. American Express has been able to defend its position thanks to the premium features it can offer its millions of customers.

With brand recognition that's been growing for decades in the United States, it would be tough for any competitor to dethrone American Express in the minds of many consumers."", ""A negative to American Express's business 10 years ago was the lack of distribution vs. payment network competitors Visa and Mastercard. In 2014, it only had an 80% merchant acceptance rate in the United States. Today, that acceptance rate has grown to 99% and is comparable with the leading card networks, which improves the customer value proposition. It is a key reason why American Express has been able to grow its transaction revenue over the last decade. If your cards are accepted at more locations, more people will use them for spending. It's that simple."", 'Management now wants to take this playbook global. It is focusing on 48 big cities with a lot of spending from wealthier customers (think London, Singapore, etc.). In 2021, 17 of these priority cities had an acceptance rate from merchants greater than 75%. This year management is hoping to double this number.', 'Growing international acceptance not only helps American Express grow spending from Americans traveling abroad, but can help them acquire customers from new markets such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan. This is an important development for American Express, and it will be the key factor in whether it can keep growing spending on its network over the next five to 10 years given how big it already is in the United States.', ""After reporting more strong earnings, American Express' stock price shot up to $202, an all-time high. It is up 7.5% this year, handily beating the returns of the S&P 500. But don't let this dissuade you from buying the stock -- it still trades at a cheap valuation."", 'In 2024, management is guiding for earnings per share (EPS) of around $13, which gives the stock a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 15.5. This P/E is still well below the S&P 500 average of 26.', 'And American Express should be able to grow its earnings much quicker than the average stock. With steady revenue growth, margin expansion, and consistent share repurchases, management has a goal of growing EPS at a mid-teens rate each year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and the performance of dividend growers over the years, and go directly to read 5 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right Now.\xa0', 'Dividend Aristocrats are a group of companies that have a history of consistently increasing their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more. Investors often view these stocks favorably because they are perceived as reliable income generators. The ability to consistently increase dividends over a long period is seen as a sign of financial strength and stability. In addition to this, these stocks have shown remarkable performance over the years, outperforming various other types of assets. As per a ProShares report citing data from Factset, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index exhibited an impressive return of 27.7% from March 2022 to April 2023. In comparison, the broader S&P 500, during the same timeframe, delivered a slightly lower return of 25.2%.', 'These stocks not only delivered impressive returns in the recent past but have consistently outperformed since the inception of the index in 2005, particularly highlighting the sustained success of dividend aristocrats. The ProShares report further mentioned that since its launch, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has consistently outpaced the S&P 500, demonstrating reduced volatility and the potential to transform a $10,000 initial investment in May 2005 into over $61,000 by March 2023. The index boasts an impressive upside-downside capture of 91% and 80%, indicating robust performance in both bullish and bearish market conditions. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most prominent dividend aristocrat stocks among investors.', ""In the realm of dividend investing, a perpetual struggle exists between prioritizing high yields and emphasizing dividend growth. Investors hold divergent opinions on this matter, but analysts consistently advocate for companies exhibiting robust and consistent dividend growth. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist affiliated with Morningstar's Index team, has frequently expressed support for companies that consistently increase their dividends. In a recent report from the firm, the analyst said investing in dividend growth differs significantly from high-dividend investing. A portfolio focused on dividend growth indicates a company's strong competitive position and improving fortunes. Such a portfolio tends to align more closely with the overall market in terms of sector exposures, growth and value characteristics, and metrics like price-to-earnings. While it may still lean towards value, a dividend growth portfolio is considered more balanced and core-oriented compared to a high-dividend portfolio."", 'Undervalued dividend aristocrats also often attract significant attention and interest among investors.

This is especially true in tech since many tech stocks soared last year. But for those willing to look beyond tech, there are some decent investments up for grabs."", 'One stock outside of tech that underperformed last year and is worth considering buying today is Tractor Supply (NASDAQ: TSCO) -- the leading rural lifestyle retailer. Not only do these stocks look likely to rise over the long haul but they also pay investors growing dividends.', ""Here's why investors may want to consider adding this stock to their portfolio."", 'While it\'s up for debate whether the economy is headed for a ""soft landing"" or a recession, most investors would agree that there\'s a risk that the Federal Reserve\'s recent rate hikes could lead to some weaker spending from consumers or, at the very least, slower growth rates in consumer spending. This has many investors looking to invest in resilient businesses -- ones in which revenue is unlikely to take a big hit if a tough macroeconomic environment does materialize.', 'Tractor Supply stock is a good option for investors looking for a reasonably priced, resilient business. Well over half of the rural lifestyle sales come from demand-driven, needs-based products like livestock feed and bedding, pet food, lubricates, fertilizer, weed control, and bird seed.', '""We are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on [consumable, usable, and edible] products,"" Tractor Supply\'s most recent annual report read. Management calls these consumable, usable, and edible products C.U.E.', ""Retail, in general, is quite finicky. But Tractor Supply's business is more resilient and predictable than most. Additionally, sales are unlikely to fall sharply during a recession since Tractor Supply's sales are heavily tied to demand-driven, needs-based products."", ""Trading at just 22 times earnings, Tractor Supply trades at an attractive valuation and looks like a buy today. This is partly because of a recent pullback in the stock price. Shares fell 4% last year even as the S&P 500 gained 24%. This was due to the company's deteriorating comparable store sales. The key metric, which measures the year-over-year change in sales at stores open for more than a year, was flat in the company's most recently reported quarter."", ""But some context is in order. Tractor Supply has been up against some very difficult comparisons. The company's comparable store sales rose about 23%, 17%, and 6% in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. It benefited from a change in the way consumers were spending as they shifted some of their budget away from services to goods. As consumers' spending habits are returning to more normalized spending patterns and as the company goes up against tough comparisons, Tractor Supply's same-store sales trends are suffering in recent quarters."", ""Astute investors, of course, realize that once spending fully reverts back to pre-pandemic patterns, Tractor Supply's same-store sales comparisons will get easier and the key growth metric will likely improve."", ""While investors wait for Tractor Supply to return to same-store sales growth, they can take refuge in the fact that the company pays out a solid dividend that has grown dramatically in recent years. The company's current quarterly dividend of $1.03 gives Tractor Supply a dividend yield of 1.8%. Highlighting how fast this dividend has grown, it's up from $0.52 just two years ago. With a payout ratio of just 39% and analysts consensus forecast calling for earnings to grow at a compound average annualized growth rate of 5.4% over the next five years, Tractor Supply will likely grow its dividend further in the coming years."", 'For more risk-averse investors, it may be worth waiting to consider buying the stock until after they have more information about how the company performed in the final quarter of 2023.

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Mondelez International's  ROE."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' View our latest analysis for Mondelez International ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mondelez International is:', '16% = US$4.6b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""At first glance, Mondelez International seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Despite this, Mondelez International's five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 2.9%. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so. Such a scenario is likely to take place when a company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Mondelez International's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 16% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see."", 'Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is MDLZ worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MDLZ is currently mispriced by the market.', ""Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 48% (implying that the company retains the remaining 52% of its income), Mondelez International's earnings growth was quite low. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline."", ""Moreover, Mondelez International has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 50%. As a result, Mondelez International's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 18% for future ROE."", ""On the whole, we do feel that Mondelez International has some positive attributes. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

In response, RBC Capital Markets said in a research note that “positive sector fundamentals” were supported by trends in hospital outpatient, inpatient and ambulatory surgery center (ASC) settings.\xa0', 'Attention now turns to the next set of prints. Stryker will report on Tuesday afternoon, followed by Boston Scientific on Wednesday morning and BD on Thursday morning.', 'Here, MedTech Dive previews what to look out for in the second week of earnings for the industry:\xa0', 'RBC analysts identified trends in outpatient and ASC settings as a good sign for Stryker and picked out J&J’s comments about the lack of change in the hip and knee markets as another positive. The analysts see Stryker as one of the “share takers” in the U.S. hip and knee markets in the quarter, after J&J reported growth for both segments. J&J’s spine and trauma results, plus Intuitive’s system placements, are other positive signs for Stryker, the analysts said.', 'Truist Securities analysts wrote in a research note they think investors are looking for Stryker to post another quarter of organic revenue out-performance, driving an earnings beat.\xa0Attention is also on the outlook for 2024, with the Truist team predicting Stryker will target an organic growth range of 6% to 8% or 7% to 9%. Both ranges cover the 7.9% consensus estimate of analysts quoted by Truist.', 'Away from the figures, the analysts expect management commentary on M&A to be the biggest area of focus. Many investors expect Stryker to do a deal this year, the analysts said, and want to know “how that will impact the company’s long-range margin trajectory.”', 'Trends in orthopedic volumes and backlog and hospital capital spending are other topics of investor interest.', 'Like Stryker, Boston Scientific is exposed to the positive outpatient and ASC trends, the RBC analysts told investors. RBC analysts also highlighted Abbott’s comments on transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), left atrial appendage closure devices and electrophysiology sales as positive for Boston Scientific. The one negative was increased competition from Abbott in the neuromodulation space, the analysts said.', 'Truist analysts expect Boston Scientific to beat the consensus organic sales estimate. Looking forward, the analysts think the company will forecast at least 8% organic sales growth, in line with the consensus estimate, but see potential for it to go higher given the change in the anticipated timing of the approval of its pulsed field ablation device, Farapulse.', '“In the past, [Boston Scientific] has guided conservatively, setting up to beat and raise and we would expect this to again be the case for 2024 as well,”\xa0Truist analysts wrote. “A slew of new product launches – Watchman Flx Pro, Acurate Neo TAVR, Farapulse in the U.S., Agent DCB Later in 2024 – should all contribute to accelerating momentum as the year progresses, particularly in 2H24.”', 'Writing before the start of results season, J.P. Morgan analysts said BD “is positioned to outperform conservative expectations.” The company, which is reporting its first-quarter results this week, used the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco earlier this month to tell investors that “sales growth played out as expected” over the first three months of its financial year, with one exception.', 'BD CEO Thomas Polen told attendees that “approximately $30 million of flu testing revenue” has moved from the first quarter to the rest of the year. J.P. Morgan analysts said “the flu headwinds are more of a headline than an actual impairment of the underlying story” but cautioned that the year is “potentially starting off on the wrong foot.”', 'The analysts were unsure whether BD was “signaling a soft [first quarter] with the flu commentary” but said “it didn’t sound quite like the beats others preannounced.” The impact of the Alaris remediation is another area of uncertainty, with the analysts hearing contradictory comments from competitors about shifts in market share. BD believes share shifts were minimal during the last few years,\xa0the analysts said.', 'Danaher and Thermo Fisher Scientific also report this week. TD Cowen analysts predicted that Danaher will “likely” predict flat to low-single-digit growth in bioproduction for the coming year.

And their results could be critical here for the market's momentum. So what should investors expect? And how could this potentially impact your investment portfolio? To break that all down, we want to bring in JJ Kinahan. He's the IG North America's CEO. And JJ, it's great to have you on set with us here this morning."", ""JJ KINAHAN: Thanks for having me, guys. You know, it's interesting. I was just sitting here thinking as you guys were talking to Josh, how often is it that you have a Fed meeting and an employment report in the same week and they're really not the top story? It's pretty amazing."", ""SEANA SMITH: So put that further in perspective for our viewers, right? When we talk about how critical these earnings results are here from five of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks here that we've been talking about ad nauseam for the last 12 or 14 months, in terms of setting the tone here for the markets, what do you think we'll learn this week?"", ""JJ KINAHAN: Well, I think Josh hit it right. You look at their earnings are incredible compared to what's going on in the rest of the market. You don't often see this where a few stocks are just so outperforming the rest of the market and have really continued to take the rest of the market on their back as we go higher."", ""Now, what I do find interesting is there's a couple of names this-- First of all, there's 106 of the S&P 500 reporting this week, so that's absolutely incredible. Secondly, there are some names outside these ones that we all talk about every single day that I'm looking at this week."", ""You have UPS reporting this week. Why do I care about UPS? You had FedEx talking about a slowdown in consumers' shipping and spending. Well, UPS back that up and say we're seeing a slowdown. We saw this incredible holiday season for consumer spending. Now that the credit card bills have hit, what's January and February going to look like? And I think that that's something that we really have to continue to watch overall."", ""And we also have GM this week. What are they going to say about electric vehicles because that directly affects one of the Magnificent Seven being Tesla? We know that they've scaled back on it. So I think that outside these ones that are, of course, just amazing stocks, perform every day, the AI I think will probably be the primary theme in there, there are some other really interesting stocks that I don't think people should overlook this week."", ""BRAD SMITH: Just as a follow up on that, is there one specific Magnificent Seven name that's reporting this week that is a bellwether even among those that are coming forward here and tells us a little bit more about the economy that investors perhaps need to know?"", ""JJ KINAHAN: I think it's Amazon. And the reason I say Amazon is all the different businesses they're in. They have retail. They have media. They have Amazon Web Services. They're developing chips-- I shouldn't say actually developing, but they're involved in AI, et cetera-- all the things that Amazon is involved with."", ""And I think that sometimes they're involved with so many things, we kind of forget all the different areas that are influenced. So that's one that I think as a retail investor who I deal with every day, people should just look at the different areas they're involved with and see how they're doing across the board, not just the headline number. That's one where it's probably worth just reading a few paragraphs down on the story and not just the headline."", ""SEANA SMITH: And JJ, when we talk about investors trying to get exposure here to this market, we have stocks here at record highs. It's also options week at Yahoo Finance, and we're going to be digging into a number of angles when it comes to options and some of the trades that are available out there for retail investors. I'm curious from your perspective and the data that you've been following, what has interest been like from a retail perspective outlet there? And then in terms of what investors should or need to keep in mind when they're considering options, what would your advice be?"", ""JJ KINAHAN: Yeah. So first of all, I think the interest continues to explode. We see the OCC, which is the Options Clearing Corporation, which clears every single options trade done on an exchange, retail traders will always trade through an exchange on options, we've seen them continuing to set records. I think the reason is the biggest underrated thing about retail investors is how great they are at managing capital."", ""A professional trader never really thinks that much about the capital they're putting up per trade. A retail trader always thinks because they have a limited amount of capital. So how much am I allocating to every single trade? It's a really important consideration. The biggest thing I would say to retail traders getting started is stay small to start. I mean, I know I work for a brokerage firm, I should be like, spend everything. No. But quite honestly, stay small to start."", ""The smaller you stay, you'll get as much-- if you're just starting out, you'll have as much pain and suffering in one contract as you will in 10 as you start to learn. Staying small, defining your risk up front are the two biggest things anybody can do to truly learn how the options market works. You know, I traded on the SIBO floor for 21 years, and it was the very first thing that I was taught. Always stay small. The easiest thing in the world to do is to become a bigger trader."", ""BRAD SMITH: And so what, with that in mind, has been the most attractive options trade that you've seen?"", ""JJ KINAHAN: Well, I don't know if I'll say the most attractive options trade that I've seen. How about this, I'll tell you some of the areas that our clients have been trading in. And a really interesting one has been Ulta. Very bullish activity in Ulta, very--"", ""BRAD SMITH: That's beauty?"", 'JJ KINAHAN: Yeah, Ulta Beauty.', 'BRAD SMITH: Beautiful.', ""JJ KINAHAN: Well played. And CVX has also been. And then on a bearish side, we've seen Lululemon, which I found kind of maybe odd. And AT&T."", ""SEANA SMITH: Are you seeing activity in some of these big tech names? You talk about the fact that there's been such a run up, investors looking for other ways to play it. What are you seeing there?"", ""JJ KINAHAN: Well, you know, it's interesting because if I look at our top 10 every day, you're going to see these names involved in there. You guys talk about them every day. They're what's driving the market overall, so people are interested in them. So yes, absolutely. We're seeing a bit of a bullish tinge to most of them. Probably Microsoft has been the one that has been the most bullish heading in their earnings."", 'BRAD SMITH: JJ, great to kick off the week with some of your insights here.

NaV1.8 is a voltage-gated sodium channel that plays a critical role in pain signaling in the peripheral nervous system. NaV1.8 is a genetically validated target for the treatment of pain, and Vertex has previously demonstrated positive proof-of-concept results and a well-tolerated profile with VX-548 in two Phase 2 studies of acute pain following abdominoplasty and bunionectomy surgeries and in a Phase 2 study in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a type of peripheral neuropathic pain. Vertex’s approach is to selectively inhibit NaV1.8 using small molecules with the objective of creating a new class of medicines that have the potential to provide effective relief of pain without the limitations of opioids, including their addictive potential. VX-548 is one of the most recent molecules to enter clinical development from Vertex’s portfolio of NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitors.', 'About Vertex', 'Vertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

The gene editing specialist won the world's first nod for a CRISPR-based gene editing therapy back in November when the U.K. authorized Casgevy for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Then the U.S. went on to approve the product for both blood disorders too."", ""What this means is CRISPR Therapeutics this year should start reporting its first product revenue. So, we're actually right at the start of the biotech's growth story -- a story that should deepen as the company advances other candidates through its pipeline. Meanwhile, the overall market has reached into bull territory, and this generally supports growth stocks. So, is CRISPR Therapeutics a buy in the new bull market? Let's find out."", 'First a bit of background on this innovative company. CRISPR Therapeutics specializes in gene editing, or the fixing of faulty genes responsible for certain diseases, and uses a technique called ""CRISPR,"" which is short for ""Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats."" The CRISPR method involves the cutting of DNA at a specific location to allow a natural repair process to take over.', 'CRISPR Therapeutics uses this technique throughout its pipeline, so the recent regulatory approval of its first product is a very big deal. We can see it as a vote of confidence in the technology, showing regulators are willing to offer potential CRISPR gene editing products the nod as long as clinical data are strong.', ""Now, the approval of Casgevy also opens up the door to potential revenue, useful to help the company fund candidates in development. CRISPR Therapeutics shares Casgevy profit with partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals, taking 40%. Vertex takes the lion's share at 60%, but Vertex also is responsible for 60% of program costs -- and this company, which currently sells a handful of other therapies, offers its experience in building out infrastructure, manufacturing, and product launches. So, this partnership represents a very good deal for CRISPR Therapeutics."", 'Product sales may take some time to grow because of the monthslong Casgevy treatment process, but over time, analysts expect Casgevy to reach blockbuster status. This is possible because of the limited treatment options right now for these blood disorders and the potential for Casgevy to serve as a functional cure. Those two facts could encourage doctors and patients to give this new treatment a try.', 'And Casgevy may be just the start for CRISPR Therapeutics. The company recently put its focus on two next-generation immuno-oncology candidates, CTX-112 and CTX-131, that offer stronger efficacy and manufacturing profiles than the first-generation candidates. CRISPR Therapeutics is studying these particular candidates in clinical trials and aims to provide an update on the studies this year. The company also is expanding into auto-immune diseases and aims to launch a clinical trial of CTX-112 in systemic lupus erythematosus in the first half of this year.', 'Thanks to these clinical programs, the company expects a ""catalyst-rich 12 to 18 months.""', ""Now, let's get back to our question. Is CRISPR Therapeutics a buy in the new bull market? As I mentioned, the company is in the early days of its growth story, with product sales as early as this year and potentially positive clinical data reports to power share price increases. Of course, any negative trial news could weigh on the stock, but this is a standard risk investors face with any biotech company."", ""As for price, CRISPR Therapeutics' shares jumped last year, but they're trading well below a peak reached a couple of years ago -- when we had a lot less visibility on the future of Casgevy and other candidates were earlier stage than they are today."", ""Both of these points make me optimistic about CRISPR Therapeutics' share price path ahead. On top of this, as mentioned above, bull markets and times of economic recovery or expansion tend to favor growth stocks. This scores another point for CRISPR Therapeutics in my book."", ""All of this means that this top gene editing stock has plenty of room to run even after last year's performance. And it makes a great stock to buy in the new bull market."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

Tell me you haven’t seen a Friday the 13th movie without telling me. Any horror film aficionado knows that if you ever survive the maniacal clutches of Jason Voorhees, it ain’t over until the credits roll. Till then, you should probably avoid any bodies of water.', 'It’s the same principle with so-called recession stocks. No one’s hoping for an economic downturn – I think we’ve all had our fair share of drama. It’s time for some positives in life. Unfortunately, some datapoints suggest we’re not out of the woods yet. For example, the consumer price index demonstrated that inflation came in a bit higher than expected.', 'Also, the December jobs report printed a number above analysts’ consensus. While that’s good from an employment standpoint, it also means that more dollars are chasing after fewer goods. As well, the housing affordability index shows that fewer households earning the median income are able to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Put another way, certain positive figures such as wage growth haven’t resulted in holistic gains for the average American. Therefore, these safe-haven stocks for a recession remain (begrudgingly) relevant.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'While a new year brings about feelings of new beginnings, for millions of business owners (including freelancers), it also means a few more months until April. And that means taxes, which can be quite complicated for entrepreneurs. Therefore, tax and accounting software specialist Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) should be intriguing as one of the safe-haven stocks for a recession.', 'According to a CNN report last year, the rise of gig workers is changing the face of the U.S. economy. And I’m not sure what to think of this projection. In this country, experts believe that there will be more gig workers than non-gig workers by 2027. If that’s really the case, INTU would make perfect sense as one of the recession stocks.', 'With the company leveraging artificial intelligence to provide even more utility for taxpayers, Intuit should continue dominating in the field of tax-prep software. Notably, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a high-side target of $720. This is one of those narratives where you simply follow the math.', 'Source: Tama2u / Shutterstock', 'While fast-food giant McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) features many overlaps with the consumer discretionary space, MCD still ranks as one of the top safe-haven stocks. Despite Generation Z gravitating toward healthier food options, the Golden Arches remains relevant. Financially, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 3.8%, above 63.5% of its peers. It’s also consistently profitable with a very strong return on invested capital (ROIC) of 20.37%.', 'Moreover, people will invariably want to go out and grab something to eat rather than cook at home. During bull markets, fancy restaurants may soak up this demand. However, if a recession materializes, Mickey D’s will probably have to do. What’s more, the U.S. fast-food market size should hit $180.32 billion by 2032. With McDonald’s owning 43.8% market share of this ecosystem, whatever’s good for the industry should boost MCD.', 'Another element that should work in the company’s favor is its forward dividend yield of 2.22%. With 48 years of consecutive dividend increases, it’s passive income you can rely on.', 'Source: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com', 'Fundamentally, the case for Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) as one of the safe-haven stocks for a recession is self-explanatory. As a consumer goods giant, P&G’s underlying products effectively enjoy permanent relevance. Also, they benefit from an economically agnostic profile. Basically, no matter what’s going on with outside circumstances, people will need to clean and care for themselves.', 'What makes PG an attractive idea for recession stocks also centers on the hard numbers. Per data from Statista, value added in the consumer goods market may reach $3.18 trillion by year’s end. Plus, the sector should see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.22% from 2024 to 2028. Admittedly, that’s not much. But because P&G dominates this arena, PG shares offer longstanding confidence.', 'This is one of those generational plays where people buy certain brands because that’s what they’ve known throughout their whole lives – and ditto for their parents and their parent’s parents. Analysts peg PG a moderate buy with a $161.25 average price target.', 'Source: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational medical devices and healthcare company, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) offers a great candidate for safe-haven stocks. Primarily, Abbott benefits from a diversified product portfolio. It’s not dependent on any one product or market. For example, during the worst of the pandemic, Abbott played a significant role in Covid-19 testing systems. Once the crisis faded, the company pivoted toward other diagnostic needs and medical devices.', 'Further, the lingering impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak draws significant attention toward ABT’s core diagnostics business. Recently, world leaders gathered to discuss Disease X, a hypothetical virus 20X deadlier than Covid-19. If such a horrible situation were to materialize, Abbott would be on the front lines. And in the meantime, the healthcare enterprise can focus on in-demand products like insulin pumps.', 'Enticingly, the company offers a forward yield of 1.92%. While it’s not the highest yield out there, Abbott has a 52-year track record of consecutive dividend increases. Plus, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with an average price target of $126.57.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Practically synonymous with the big-box retail category, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is one of the most recognizable ideas for safe-haven stocks for a recession. Should the economic waste matter hit the proverbial fan, WMT could be a great idea to have in your portfolio. It probably won’t make you rich. However, you can bank on its many relevancies, such as the underlying everyday low pricing business model.', 'Because Walmart is a one-stop shop, offering everything from groceries to video games, it’s a reasonably sensible play if you anticipate the possibility of a slowdown occurring. One advantage that the company enjoys is its massive footprint despite the encroachment of e-commerce. True, online sales have picked up conspicuously since the second quarter of 2022. Still, Walmart remains relevant – especially among the modest-income crowd – because of the immediacy effect.', 'You don’t need to wait around for packages to arrive to your doorstep. Even better, you don’t need to pay shipping fees or membership dues. Rather, just make a shopping list and get everything done at Walmart. It’s sensible, practical and economical – a great idea for recession stocks.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'When it comes to safe-haven stocks for a recession, it’s difficult to overlook Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE). Based in San Diego, California, Sempra doesn’t exactly get much love from its customers. Honestly, what utility does? However, what makes SRE so attractive is that it serves large chunks of the lucrative Southern California market. In my opinion – as an investor – that’s worth the price of admission.', 'In discussing the Golden State, it’s invariable that critics will point out the migration trends: people are leaving California. However, not every city in the state is experiencing a net exit of people. In the utility’s hometown, the population will peak – in 2042. As I argued in my analysis for TipRanks, that gives Sempra a long runway.', 'Notably, SRE gives out a decent forward yield of 3.27%. Further, the company enjoys a track record of 20 years of consecutive payout increases. Unsurprisingly, analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with an $81.55 average price target. Sempra’s a relatively easy idea for recession stocks.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'A controversial market idea for any context, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) may seem particularly odd when discussing safe-haven stocks. As multiple resources have pointed out, tobacco use rates globally show a continued decline. Advocacy groups have done a great job of taking away the cool factor associated with smoking imagery from prior paradigms. So, given this social evolution, why would anyone want to buy PM stock?', 'Though traditional smoking may not be as popular, global vaping rates have soared. Regarding youth usage, one vice has simply replaced another. That’s the ugly, controversial component related to any tobacco enterprise. On the other hand, if you’re looking at straight numbers from the legitimate adult market, the global e-cigarette and vape sector could see revenue of $182.84 billion in 2030.', 'If so, we’re talking about a CAGR of 30.6% from 2023 to 2030. While you’re waiting for this narrative to materialize, Philip Morris offers a forward yield of 5.63%. Combined with analysts rating shares a strong buy with a $105.75 target, this is a difficult idea to pass up.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.', ""In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Stryker (NYSE:SYK), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it."", ' View our latest analysis for Stryker ', ""The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Stryker grew its EPS by 13% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained."", ""It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Stryker achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 11% to US$20b. That's a real positive."", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Stryker's future EPS 100% free."", ""Since Stryker has a market capitalisation of US$118b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$13b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock."", ""One important encouraging feature of Stryker is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for Stryker that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Tell me you haven’t seen a Friday the 13th movie without telling me. Any horror film aficionado knows that if you ever survive the maniacal clutches of Jason Voorhees, it ain’t over until the credits roll. Till then, you should probably avoid any bodies of water.', 'It’s the same principle with so-called recession stocks. No one’s hoping for an economic downturn – I think we’ve all had our fair share of drama. It’s time for some positives in life. Unfortunately, some datapoints suggest we’re not out of the woods yet. For example, the consumer price index demonstrated that inflation came in a bit higher than expected.', 'Also, the December jobs report printed a number above analysts’ consensus. While that’s good from an employment standpoint, it also means that more dollars are chasing after fewer goods. As well, the housing affordability index shows that fewer households earning the median income are able to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Put another way, certain positive figures such as wage growth haven’t resulted in holistic gains for the average American. Therefore, these safe-haven stocks for a recession remain (begrudgingly) relevant.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'While a new year brings about feelings of new beginnings, for millions of business owners (including freelancers), it also means a few more months until April. And that means taxes, which can be quite complicated for entrepreneurs. Therefore, tax and accounting software specialist Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) should be intriguing as one of the safe-haven stocks for a recession.', 'According to a CNN report last year, the rise of gig workers is changing the face of the U.S. economy. And I’m not sure what to think of this projection. In this country, experts believe that there will be more gig workers than non-gig workers by 2027. If that’s really the case, INTU would make perfect sense as one of the recession stocks.', 'With the company leveraging artificial intelligence to provide even more utility for taxpayers, Intuit should continue dominating in the field of tax-prep software. Notably, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a high-side target of $720. This is one of those narratives where you simply follow the math.', 'Source: Tama2u / Shutterstock', 'While fast-food giant McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) features many overlaps with the consumer discretionary space, MCD still ranks as one of the top safe-haven stocks. Despite Generation Z gravitating toward healthier food options, the Golden Arches remains relevant. Financially, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 3.8%, above 63.5% of its peers. It’s also consistently profitable with a very strong return on invested capital (ROIC) of 20.37%.', 'Moreover, people will invariably want to go out and grab something to eat rather than cook at home. During bull markets, fancy restaurants may soak up this demand. However, if a recession materializes, Mickey D’s will probably have to do. What’s more, the U.S. fast-food market size should hit $180.32 billion by 2032. With McDonald’s owning 43.8% market share of this ecosystem, whatever’s good for the industry should boost MCD.', 'Another element that should work in the company’s favor is its forward dividend yield of 2.22%. With 48 years of consecutive dividend increases, it’s passive income you can rely on.', 'Source: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com', 'Fundamentally, the case for Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) as one of the safe-haven stocks for a recession is self-explanatory. As a consumer goods giant, P&G’s underlying products effectively enjoy permanent relevance. Also, they benefit from an economically agnostic profile. Basically, no matter what’s going on with outside circumstances, people will need to clean and care for themselves.', 'What makes PG an attractive idea for recession stocks also centers on the hard numbers. Per data from Statista, value added in the consumer goods market may reach $3.18 trillion by year’s end. Plus, the sector should see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.22% from 2024 to 2028. Admittedly, that’s not much. But because P&G dominates this arena, PG shares offer longstanding confidence.', 'This is one of those generational plays where people buy certain brands because that’s what they’ve known throughout their whole lives – and ditto for their parents and their parent’s parents. Analysts peg PG a moderate buy with a $161.25 average price target.', 'Source: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational medical devices and healthcare company, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) offers a great candidate for safe-haven stocks. Primarily, Abbott benefits from a diversified product portfolio. It’s not dependent on any one product or market. For example, during the worst of the pandemic, Abbott played a significant role in Covid-19 testing systems. Once the crisis faded, the company pivoted toward other diagnostic needs and medical devices.', 'Further, the lingering impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak draws significant attention toward ABT’s core diagnostics business. Recently, world leaders gathered to discuss Disease X, a hypothetical virus 20X deadlier than Covid-19. If such a horrible situation were to materialize, Abbott would be on the front lines. And in the meantime, the healthcare enterprise can focus on in-demand products like insulin pumps.', 'Enticingly, the company offers a forward yield of 1.92%. While it’s not the highest yield out there, Abbott has a 52-year track record of consecutive dividend increases. Plus, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with an average price target of $126.57.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Practically synonymous with the big-box retail category, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is one of the most recognizable ideas for safe-haven stocks for a recession. Should the economic waste matter hit the proverbial fan, WMT could be a great idea to have in your portfolio. It probably won’t make you rich. However, you can bank on its many relevancies, such as the underlying everyday low pricing business model.', 'Because Walmart is a one-stop shop, offering everything from groceries to video games, it’s a reasonably sensible play if you anticipate the possibility of a slowdown occurring. One advantage that the company enjoys is its massive footprint despite the encroachment of e-commerce. True, online sales have picked up conspicuously since the second quarter of 2022. Still, Walmart remains relevant – especially among the modest-income crowd – because of the immediacy effect.', 'You don’t need to wait around for packages to arrive to your doorstep. Even better, you don’t need to pay shipping fees or membership dues. Rather, just make a shopping list and get everything done at Walmart. It’s sensible, practical and economical – a great idea for recession stocks.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'When it comes to safe-haven stocks for a recession, it’s difficult to overlook Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE). Based in San Diego, California, Sempra doesn’t exactly get much love from its customers. Honestly, what utility does? However, what makes SRE so attractive is that it serves large chunks of the lucrative Southern California market. In my opinion – as an investor – that’s worth the price of admission.', 'In discussing the Golden State, it’s invariable that critics will point out the migration trends: people are leaving California. However, not every city in the state is experiencing a net exit of people. In the utility’s hometown, the population will peak – in 2042. As I argued in my analysis for TipRanks, that gives Sempra a long runway.', 'Notably, SRE gives out a decent forward yield of 3.27%. Further, the company enjoys a track record of 20 years of consecutive payout increases. Unsurprisingly, analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with an $81.55 average price target. Sempra’s a relatively easy idea for recession stocks.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'A controversial market idea for any context, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) may seem particularly odd when discussing safe-haven stocks. As multiple resources have pointed out, tobacco use rates globally show a continued decline. Advocacy groups have done a great job of taking away the cool factor associated with smoking imagery from prior paradigms. So, given this social evolution, why would anyone want to buy PM stock?', 'Though traditional smoking may not be as popular, global vaping rates have soared. Regarding youth usage, one vice has simply replaced another. That’s the ugly, controversial component related to any tobacco enterprise.

With three consecutive weeks of gain and 12 out of 13 weeks in positive territory, Wall Street's benchmark has demonstrated resilience.Following a notable decline in the inflation rate last year, the Federal Reserve responded by initially scaling back the intensity of interest rate hikes and eventually halting them altogether in July 2023. This strategic decision contributed to an impressive 23.9% rally in the S&P 500 Index last year.Going forward in 2024, the Fed is poised to implement an interest rate reduction. This move is anticipated to be favorable for stock markets, as a lower risk-free interest rate will decrease the discount rate, positively impacting the net present value of equity investments.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'Investors widely favor dividend-paying stocks, irrespective of the frequency at which dividends are distributed. While a majority of companies adhere to a quarterly dividend distribution schedule to provide returns to shareholders, there are variations in payout frequency. Some companies opt for a monthly dividend distribution, offering investors more regular income streams, while others choose an annual payout structure. The appeal of dividend-paying stocks lies in the steady income they provide, making them attractive to a diverse range of investors seeking a reliable source of returns from their investments.', 'The frequency of dividend payments is not a determining factor in the attractiveness of these stocks, as they have consistently delivered robust returns over the years. A report by Hartford Funds highlighted that from 1930 to 2022, the contribution of dividend income to the total return of the S&P 500 Index averaged 41%. Apart from their substantial contribution to the overall market return, dividends are attractive to investors due to their yields. However, the common mistake among investors seeking dividend-paying investments is to solely focus on those offering the highest yields. A study conducted by Wellington Management sheds light on the potential pitfalls of this approach.', ""Wellington Management analyzed by categorizing dividend-paying stocks into quintiles based on their dividend payouts. The top 20%, labeled as the first quintile, comprised the highest dividend payers, while the bottom 20%, the fifth quintile, consisted of the lowest dividend payers. Surprisingly, the study found that second-quintile stocks outperformed the S&P 500 Index in eight out of the 10 time periods spanning from 1930 to 2022. The first- and third-quintile stocks tied for second place, collectively beating the Index 67% of the time. On the contrary, fourth- and fifth-quintile stocks consistently lagged behind by a significant margin. The superior performance of second-quintile dividend-paying stocks can be attributed to the fact that the excessive dividend payouts of first-quintile stocks haven't always proven to be sustainable over time. This highlights the importance of a more nuanced approach when selecting dividend-paying investments, considering factors beyond just the immediate yield."", 'In this context, it is more sensible to consider companies that consistently raise their dividends. Dividend growth, especially when coupled with robust balance sheets and substantial yields, can offer investors a reliable source of income, act as a buffer against market downturns, and potentially contribute to the healthy growth of investments. According to a report from Guardian Capital citing data from Goldman Sachs, from 1970 to 2021, companies that are consistent dividend growers and payers have demonstrated better performance compared to non-dividend payers and those that have reduced dividends, especially during periods characterized by high inflation and rising interest rates.', 'While major companies such as The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc.

Most of these companies are traded on American exchanges, however, some foreign companies on our list are traded on the OTC market.

Consequently, it's important to note that their dividend yields could be comparatively lower. We measured hedge fund sentiment around American stocks based on Insider Monkey's database for Q2 2023.

We had a legit snow.', ""Ricky Mulvey: I'll take your word for it. Let's talk about Netflix. Netflix got a big deal this morning. The streamer is paying $5 billion to get WWE raw for 10 years starting next January. The TKO Group which is the combination of the UFC and the WWE. Those investors are a little bit more excited than the Netflix investors. Talk to me. Why do you think Netflix is going heavy on these live events right now?"", ""Bill Mann: I love the fact that I've been called upon to talk about wrestling because I grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, which was the home of Dorton Arena. So we had all the time, Rowdy Roddy Piper and Dusty Rhodes, and the Russian Bear, Ivan Koloff, coming into our climb. Wrestling is something that is in my blood. But back in the '70s we would not have expected wrestling to go for $5 billion worth in terms of television viewing revenues. It's really staggering. I think from Netflix standpoint in some ways this is battening down the hatches in the area in which it probably feels like it has the most vulnerability versus other streaming services. They have not really done much or have they really successfully cracked the code on live entertainment. Wrestling is something that's interesting because it's live entertainment but it also has a longer tail than almost any other form of sports entertainment. I'm making up a number. But 95% of the people who watch a football game watch it within the first 24 hours. With wrestling you can go back and because there's a story line attached to it there is much more of a tail there and those are things that Netflix knows how to handle. It's a really interesting transaction to me because of those two things."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I also envision an executive conference room where the words scalable and repeatable are often being used about this.

I think what's also significant is that WWE on a Monday night unless there's Monday night football going on it is often the number 1, 2, and 3 cable television show. This is a signal for linear television where your top three dogs are literally leaving and WWE is saying, you know what? We're going to lose some of our audience because there's going to be friction in this transaction. Shout out to the Schwab discussion we'll have later. But they're saying this trade-off is going to be worth it or what Howard Stern did to radio and what Joe Rogan did to podcasting a little bit."", ""Bill Mann: It really does show and it's why just to make a little bit of a bizarre step in this conversation it is why content is still king. It is not to say that Disney hasn't had a huge amount of missteps for example including how they've managed their content. But at the end of the day if you were to ask me do I want to invest in a pipes company or do I want to invest in a content company it's the content company all the time."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's kick out, talk about Procter & Gamble. They reported this morning the expectations. But what's grabbing headlines is another Gillette write down for the razor maker. P&G bought it back in 2005 for $54 billion. Four years ago P&G took an $8 billion charge on Gillette. This quarter it's another $1.3 billion dollar write down. Bill Mann, what happened?"", ""Bill Mann: Accounting is such a funny thing. I just want to go back and emphasize that you're talking about a transaction that happened in 2005. It was $54 billion, it was about $95 billion in today's dollar. So it was a huge transaction for Procter & Gamble. But basically the way accounting works is they put that transaction on their books and it's considered an asset but they have to make a determination whether that asset is impaired or not. They're going back for an 18 year old transaction and they're saying we don't believe that we're going to make full value from that transaction for Gillette. It just goes to show in business how much stuff is left to chance. Because Procter & Gamble is a very savvy company. You're not talking about a company that goes out and does wild things. They went out and bought a dominant razor and blade company thinking that the environment in which they were operating in 2005 could last long enough that they would be able to you to regain their investments. AI is not a risk to people needing to shave. It just isn't. What they really didn't get right was that things actually did change."", ""Ricky Mulvey: They didn't. It's a story about pricing power. It's existed, it's a question I think for some product Procter & Gamble and right now though I'll also add grooming is watch me from Cincinnati play defense on this. [LAUGHTER]"", ""Ricky Mulvey: Grooming is the smallest segment for the company. It's 8% of sales. This is a multi-billion dollar company that still seems to be doing all right."", ""Bill Mann: I mean, that's the baseline. I think that's exactly right. Again, fascinating that we're talking about in 18 year plus ago transaction that is still on their books is being written up and down. A couple of things happened. One was that the distribution channels changed a little bit. You remember Dollar Shave Club, and they're fantastic ads, that bit a little bit. But what really bit into Procter & Gamble was at the time that they made this transaction, the thing that it seemed like the world was counting on was that the dollar was in a decline. What has happened almost linearly since 2005 is that the dollar has gone up against almost every other currency in the world. It's made it much more expensive to buy Gillette products. They call out places like Argentina and Nigeria, but those are simply placeholders for all of the countries that are outside of the US where the middle class is going to be price conscious. It has harmed this transaction for Procter & Gamble."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I want to exclude the write down. Let's adjust that gap bill. If you exclude the write down operating income would have been up 21% for the quarter year every year. This is as you said it's a company that's not affected by AI. It's not one that you would expect to be quickly growing like that. It still has some pricing juice left in it. In organic sales, you're still doing OK."", ""Bill Mann: You said something important and I'm going to pull back, and you said, let's ignore the write down, which is a fine thing to do because Procter & Gamble doesn't have many of them. It is a red flag when you see a company that has every quarter or every year, they've got a different write down. Because then they can say, that's non cash. When in actuality they spent cash and debt to buy this. It's the realest cash there is. Procter & Gamble is right to downplay this, write down in the impact to it. Because it was money that was spent 18 years ago. From an accounting perspective, it was right of them to do, but you are absolutely right that Procter & Gamble is doing absolutely fine, and 21% rise is nothing to sneeze at."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Before we go, I also I want to check in on Charles Schwab with you. Deidre, Matt Frankel took a look at the banking sector last week. I know you follow Charles Schwab. There's a pretty gloomy article about the company in the Wall Street Journal. It's maybe not a banking crisis, but Chuck still seems to be going through it. Looking at the latest quarter, there were a lot of parentheses in the wrong places bill. A year ago, Schwab paid about 800 million in interest expense on the quarter. This year it paid 1 billion more. How's that happen?"", ""Bill Mann: Well, you've heard about rates going up."", 'Ricky Mulvey: [laughs] It makes money on interest revenue.', 'Bill Mann: Not, exactly bight but you know who else does?', 'Ricky Mulvey: The savers? The people fighting T bills.', ""Bill Mann: Basically, since 2009, we have been punished to save. It has been absolutely fine at places like Charles Schwab. Charles Schwab isn't organized as a brokerage, it's organized as a savings and loan. That it is, at its core, a bank. For years, people who have not had their money invested in stocks, have had them in sweep accounts where you've been paid, 0.1% on your money. But as it turns out, when you go into a higher interest rate environment, it becomes beneficial for Schwab's customers to put their money that's not allocated to stocks or other investments into interest bearing instruments. That's where the billion comes. That's from members reinvesting their money, taking it out of cash, and putting it into interest bearing vehicles. That's something that's called cash sorting, and it is something that is costly to Schwab, but they had to expect it. I mean, it is something that was absolutely part of what a savings and loan at its core does."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yes, so Schwab lost essentially 175 billion in bank deposits, which is nearly 40% of what it had at its peak. That's bad. There's a version of this where that means you have a banking crisis, and Schwab doesn't seem to be having that."", ""Bill Mann: No, exactly. That's what's entirely different about what's happening at Schwab. In 2023, people after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed are like, what's the next one? There's Schwab, because under accounting standards, this seems like a banking crisis. But Schwab, they haven't been losing money. People haven't been withdrawing from Schwab. They've been taking bank deposits, and then transferring them into T bills, or transferring them into CD's. Or transferring them into higher interest bearing instruments, which changes the capital ratios at Charles Schwab. But Charles Schwab, unless they are forced to revalue the debt side of their balance sheet, it's not great for Charles Schwab, and it's really not great in an environment in which they are already undertaking a merger with TD Bank at all of those deposits. But it really is just the valley of the shadow of death that they've got to walk through. They're going through the fire swamp, that's what I would say, Ricky."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Fire swamp?', ""Bill Mann: Some would say that it's impossible to get to the other side, but Wesley and Buttercup did it. Schwab's going to do it too."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I mean, for as much friction as there is with the TD Ameritrade merger, they've got 15 million accounts going over, they've got basically 1.6 trillion in assets. Basically, everyone gets a letter at TD Ameritrade, which is a negative consent letter, meaning hey, if you want to opt out of this, you can credible. [laughs] Actually, I know the wealth management firms are not happy about that. Anytime you give just a reminder, if you want to leave, you can. They got they got a couple of frictions coming at them right now."", ""Bill Mann: They've got friction, but imagine thinking that a firm that has, $8 Trillion in client assets under management, and it's 33 million client accounts. It's just going to be allowed to fail by Uncle Sam because of a capital ratio. It's not going to happen. With Schwab, I look at a company that had a very, very bad year. Some of it was unfortunate, some of it was they had flown a little close to the sun. But at a baseline, the price that is available for Schwab now absolutely takes into account most reasonable case scenarios for the company. It's not good at Schwab but if you believe that a dominant bank with a history of innovation has a steady state, that steady state, I think is higher than it is now."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Uncle Sam, always looking out for the little guy. He's a Schwab shareholder bill, I hope that's the case. I hope they don't forget about them. But as always, Bill, appreciate your time and your insight."", 'Bill Mann: Thank you so much, Ricky.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Before we get to our ad in our next segment, I wanted to throw in a quick pitch that if you find value in the show, please leave us a review on Apple podcasts.

Dr. Michael Finke is a professor of wealth management and the director for the Granum Center for Financial Security at the American College of Financial Services. He caught up with Robert Brokamp to talk about his research in the first of a two part conversation."", 'Robert Brokamp: Michael, you have two PhDs. The first one you earned is in consumer economics. In that first chapter of your career, what did you learn about why some people make better choices when it comes to purchases like food, and how did that lead you to getting a PhD in finance?', ""Michael Finke: Wow, that it's an interesting part of my career. I was interested in knowing what motivated people to eat healthy foods. I found in my research that there was this amazing correlation between eating healthy foods, and exercising, and saving. I thought, well, there's got to be some an interesting theory that connects what motivates people to eat well and to also save. I took a finance class, it was actually a PhD class in investments. At the end of the class, I love the class, by the way. I thought it was so fascinating, I loved investments theory. At the end of the class, my professor took me aside and said, ''Do you realize how much more money you could be making if you were a PhD student in finance, than studying food consumption?'' That served as a jump for my second PhD in finance. Now, there was a lot of overlapping content between the two, because as much as finance, people don't want to admit it, it's just applied economics. I was doing applied economics when I was studying food consumption, and I'm still doing applied economics right now. It's just a topic that tends to be of interest to people who have money, which is a good thing as an economic."", 'Robert Brokamp: We recently did an episode on the correlation between health and wealth. In terms of cause and effect, we felt like it went both ways. Did you find what cause one or the other, or is it people just wired to be better with their money and their bodies?', ""Michael Finke: Yeah. There is this idea that one of the reasons why people who have more money live longer is perhaps because they have access to higher quality healthcare. Actually, there's really not a whole lot of evidence to support that. What seems to be happening is that the people who do things like eat better and exercise, and they are making investments in their health. Now, what is an investment? An investment is a sacrifice that you make in your joy today in order to experience more joy in the future. It really is just what we call an inter-temporal choice. Anytime we make an investment, whether it's eating the grilled chicken instead of having a hamburger for lunch, or whether it's getting up in the morning and going to the gym, as opposed to doing something that's maybe a little bit more fun, which is just about anything. All of those are motivated by this desire to live better in the future, and so that also motivates people to save more. I'm doing some interesting research right now on positivity, and I had no idea. We did this survey, we added a few questions about how positive is your outlook about the future. I didn't expect them to be really strong predictors of financial outcomes. They ended up being huge predictors of how much people save for retirement. Even things like asset allocation, or you're willing to take more risk if you have a more positive view of the future. All of this I think is just fascinating getting into what motivates us to choose one type of financial behavior or another, but it does seem to be a powerful way of thinking about that motivation is as an investment and investments in health, investments in relationships are similar to investments in mind."", ""Robert Brokamp: When it comes to retirement as a goal, which has really become much more of your focus. People have to decide on the price of that goal, starting with how much income they'll need to maintain their lifestyle and retirement. I'm sure that many people have heard that they'll need around 75% of their pre-retirement income when they retire. Is that a good starting point?"", ""Michael Finke: It depends. It could be higher, it could be lower. It could be higher if you earn less money, and it could be lower, if you earn more money. Now, that means that, let's say someone who's making between 100 and $200,000 a year. If you think about it, they're already saving especially if they're doing catch up contributions after the age of 50, they might be saving 15% or even 20% of their income. That's money that's not being spent. If they're making $200,000 a year, you're going to start at $160,000 right there. Then you've got payroll taxes that you don't have to pay in retirement, Social Security, Medicare taxes, you don't have to pay that stuff. That's another 15% if you're self-employed, half of that if you're employed with a company. The fact is that most people don't spend every single penny of their paycheck, especially people who watch shows like this, or there are people who tend to accumulate money in their savings account. What I found is if you look closely at the data even before retirement, someone who's making a couple $100,000 a year, probably only spending about 55-60% of that, that's the lifestyle that they need to replace in retirement."", ""That's good news, I think, especially in an environment where you believe that asset returns are going to be lower than they have been in the past. The goal is more attainable and of course, you have Social Security, which serves as a foundation. You simply have to make up the difference in that lifestyle over the course of an expected lifetime in retirement. Now, that lifetime in retirement, of course, we were talking about health investment. David Blanchett, who works at PGIM, used to work at Morning Star when I did a study where we looked at people who save and define contribution plans. People who save and defined contribution plans are different than the average American, because they tend to make more money. People who make more money are healthier, which means that it's far more likely that they're going to live on average into their late '80s, which means that their time horizon, if they retire at 65, is probably on average about 23-25 years. Then you have this uncertainty that surrounds how long the money needs to last, and boy, that is the ultimate issue is none of us know exactly how much money we need to save, because none of us knows exactly how long retirement is going to last, nor do we know the returns that we're going to get on our investment portfolio."", ""Robert Brokamp: There's also the question of how spending changes over the course of retirement. Because if you use a retirement calculator, or even the foundations of the old 4% rule, which we may talk about later, the assumption is that your expenses go up every year in retirement. But is that generally the case?"", 'Michael Finke: No.', ""Ricky Mulvey: There's two questions here. On average, how much does spending decline in real after-inflation terms? It does tend to go down. There's some differences of opinion based on the way people do research on this topic, but the reality is that we're not going to be able to spend as much money when we're 90 as we could when we were 70. Now the other part of that question is how much happiness are we going to get per dollar of going on vacation when we're 90 as opposed to going on vacation when we're 70. That is a compelling reason to front load some of that spending. But that makes retirement more risky because you're spending more early on. That means that you're more susceptible to what's known as a bad sequence of investment returns early on, you could significantly deplete your savings."", ""Think about it. You're a 65 year old healthy woman. You are, on average, going to live to age 90. Let's say you've got five rows of five circles, and you've got so much money saved, and you've got to decide how many chips you're going to put in each one of those circles. Do you put them all when you're 90? Do you conserve your chips so that they're left over if you live to be more than 90 or do you put more of your chips on 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 When you're more physically and cognitively capable of enjoying the money, that might make more sense. That's part of the game of life, is that we've got to figure out where to put our chips. If a lot of people just end up conserving their chips because they're worried about running out. That just means that your kids are going to spend the money. They're going to have the fun that you didn't have between the ages of 65 and 75."", ""Michael Finke: Some of your research has shown that for the median retiree, they're spending about 8% less than they probably could. For wealthier retirees, they're maybe even spending 50% less than they could, possibly, because they're so worried about running out of money."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, to me that's the big mystery. I have a new article coming out on this topic, which is why do so many people who say they are not that interested in passing money on to others after they're gone, why do they just not spend the money? I've done interviews with retirees and I consistently see how proud they are of the fact that they're not spending down their money. They're 10 years into retirement. They have more money than they did 10 years before. They're proud of it. Because they even look at me like, you're a finance guy, you should be proud of it too. I'm not. I think they're making a mistake. I think that they've, wasted 10 years essentially because they haven't spent the money in a more rational fashion. Now, if that's your goal, if you really want to pass it on after you're gone, then don't spend it like, that's fine. That's the way to win the game. But if that's not your goal, then there's only two places your money can go. You can either spend it on yourself or you can pass it on to others. If passing it on to others isn't that important to you, let's put together a plan for actually spending the money while you can still enjoy it."", ""Michael Finke: When you talk about how much someone can safely spend each year, that brings up the topic of safe withdrawal rates, which most people have heard of is 4%. Some say it's too low, some say it's too high. What's your take? I'm guessing that you don't agree with Dave Ramsey who in November said it should be 7% to 8%."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah. Dave Ramsey said that his mathematics was very clear. That is, since stocks always return 12% and inflation is 4% you should easily be able to withdraw 8% of your savings balance as your retirement income plan. Now, there are so many things wrong with that. You want to keep me focused here for a moment. But first of all, they don't actually return 12% because there's a difference between what's known as geometric returns and arithmetic returns. He's referring to the arithmetic average. Geometric is what you actually keep. In other words, if you have a year like 2022, your investments go down by 20% then you have to get a 25% return the next year just to get back to where you started."", ""On average, you may have had a 2.5% return, but you have exactly the same amount of money as when you started. That's the difference between arithmetic and geometric returns, so he's ignoring that. The other part that he's ignoring is what happens if you get unlucky at the very beginning of retirement. Let's say you have one million dollars, you're pulling $80,000 out the first year. What happens if your portfolio goes from a million down to $800,000. Now you're pulling $80,000 out of it. You have $720,000 at the end of Year 1. Do you again pull $80,000 out of there? Well, what happens if the market's flat now you're down to 640. It's not difficult to imagine that you're going to be out of money pretty quickly. In the early 2000, you can pretty much pick your year in the 2000. If you would have followed that strategy, it would have maybe taken anywhere between 10 and 15 year to run out of money if you would experience that same sequence of returns."", ""The sequence of returns risk is a very real thing. It means that you're going to have to significantly adjust your lifestyle downward if you get a bad sequence. You simply can't just be blind to whatever return that you got. That's what the 4% rule is based on. It is this idea that if I have one million dollars, I can spend $40,000 the first year. I can increase that by the rate of inflation that should last me over the course of 30 years. What happens if I get unlucky? What happens if my portfolio falls the first year? What if it falls again the second year? Do I continue to spend $40,000 a year plus inflation? At some point you're going to say, that's getting a little bit risky. I'm not comfortable with that. Maybe I should adjust that spending downward. That's what you should do. That is the way that a rational person would respond to a down market. They would spend less. I think that that which was known as a flexible withdrawal strategy or something that involves guard rails."", ""In other words, you could maybe go up by a half a percent per year or something like that, that's the right way to do it. That allows you to pull more money out at the beginning, by the way, because you know you spend more early on in retirement as long as you're willing to make adjustments. If you get unlucky and remember that bad luck, that's going to cause you to have to adjust your spending downward. But what if you get good luck? In other words, what if at the beginning of retirement you have a positive sequence of returns, then should you not spend more? It shouldn't just be your financial advisor and your kids who benefit from the risk that you took, you should be able to spend more also. That's what's known as flexible spending rule, I'm a big fan of that. I think that's the right way to do it. Now, you can do a flexible spending rule only if you have the ability to be flexible in your spending. That's why I think one of the stages of planning for retirement income is evaluating how flexible you are capable of being with your retirement budget. Because if you do have a segment of the budget which is simply not flexible, then you can't take investment risk with that portion of the budget. You're going to have to cover it with Social Security and some other strategy that is not going to require you to cut back if you get on money."", ""As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned in the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

Firstly, the regular payouts from these stocks assist investors in meeting their immediate liquidity requirements. Secondly, historical data suggests that focusing on dividend-paying investments has the potential to reduce market volatility and mitigate losses during market downturns. Specifically, companies that consistently increase their dividends may offer a level of protection during bearish market conditions. Analyzing the timeframe from December 31, 1999, to March 31, 2022, when the overall market experienced declines, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats demonstrated superior performance compared to both the S&P Composite 1500 and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index. On average, they outperformed by 140 basis points per month and 49 basis points per month, respectively.', 'Strategies centered on dividend growth have the potential to alleviate apprehensions related to the performance of stocks with high dividend payouts in an environment of rising interest rates, as reported by S&P Dow Indices. This is achieved through two key mechanisms. Firstly, as these strategies prioritize consistent dividend increases over high initial yields, their performance is less influenced by the value factor when compared to high dividend-paying stocks. Consequently, the performance of dividend growth strategies is expected to be more resilient in growth-oriented markets. The report highlighted that, considering the emphasis on strong balance sheets, dividend growth strategies might appeal to investors concerned about volatility and the possibility of increasing interest rates. These strategies allow investors to stay engaged in the stock market while also generating income. For those concentrating on U.S. equities, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats are presented as a potential solution for pursuing dividend growth.', ""In 2023, dividend stocks faced a performance decline attributed to the surge in the technology sector. Nevertheless, there is a belief among certain traders that dividend stocks might stage a comeback in the current year.

In a challenging operating environment, BLK handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and assets under management (AUM) balance more than offset a rise in total expenses. In an effort to capitalize on an accelerating demand for infrastructure investment, it announced an agreement to acquire Global Infrastructure Partners for $3 billion in cash and around 12 million shares of BlackRock common stock.In the fourth quarter of 2023, the industry players continued to face a challenging operating backdrop, though, in the later part of the quarter, some clarity on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate path offered support. We are using our proprietary methodology to find stocks that are poised to outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter. By using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified three such asset management stocks — SEI Investments Company SEIC, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. TROW and Principal Financial Group, Inc. PFG. \xa0These stocks have the ideal combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.Before we go into the details regarding the abovementioned asset managers, let’s first understand the factors that are likely to have influenced quarterly performance.The performance of equity markets during the fourth quarter was robust. The S&P 500 Index gained 11.2% in the quarter, driven by the central bank’s signal of no further hike in rates this cycle, three interest rate cuts in 2024 and fading near-term recession risks. Thus, the market value of assets witnessed a rise, supporting performance fees.Further, as the U.S. dollar lost some value, FX favorably impacted the asset managers’ performance. All these supported the asset price and also resulted in net inflows.On the cost front, as asset managers continue to optimize operations through digital initiatives, expenses are likely to have been manageable. However, fears of an economic slowdown are likely to have driven cost-cutting measures among many industry players, which might have led to one-time restructuring expenses.', 'The Zacks Finance sector’s (of which asset management is part) earnings are projected to rise 9.9% year over year in the fourth quarter.

The company offers investment processing, management and operations solutions globally.Similar to other industry players, SEIC is likely to have benefited from solid equity market performance in the to-be-reported quarter. This is likely to have aided the company’s inflows and AUM balance.SEI Investments is scheduled to announce results on Jan 31 after market close.

The company reported a Dec 31, 2023 preliminary AUM balance of $1.45 trillion. Though it has improved on a year-over-year basis, the company recorded preliminary net outflows of $28.3 billion during the fourth quarter. Thus, this is likely to have marred the company’s performance fee to some extent.T. Rowe Price is slated to announce results on Feb 8 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.60, implying a fall of 8.1% year over year. TROW has an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.', 'T.

The impact that a sustained downturn can have on the stock market can be a shock to both newly minted investors with a focus on growth, and those not so new who are counting on dividends to bolster their fixed-income flow, especially after retiring.', ""I'm in the latter group and have supplemented the Social Security benefits I draw with the regular payouts of dividend stalwarts, including Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE: FRT), a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a notable record for weathering economic gyrations."", 'There have been seven U.S. recessions since Federal Realty was founded in 1962, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Each was different in cause, severity, and duration, but one constant to consider is that Federal Realty continued increasing its annual shareholder payouts during each of them.', ""That places this REIT in the exclusive company of Dividend Kings, publicly traded companies that have at least 50 straight years of dividend increases. Make that 57 straight years for Federal Realty. It's the only REIT on the list."", ""Like all equity REITs, Federal Realty generates cash flow from a pool of income-producing properties and is obliged to pay at least 90% of its taxable income each year to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unlike many other REITs, however, it hasn't had to cut its payouts because of tenants who suddenly were unable to pay their rent."", ""That's due in part to the savvy and seasoned management of a company deeply committed to dividend payouts, and to the nature of the portfolio they've built: a collection of 102 retail-based properties centered in high-income, first-ring suburbs around such desirable markets as Washington, D.C., Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. "", 'The focus now is on developing and redeveloping properties in urban, mixed-use neighborhoods that include recession-resistant retail and residential units along with a smattering of offices and hotels.', ""The TJX Companies is the REIT's largest tenant, accounting for 37 stores and about 2.7% of the rent roll, with other significantly durable occupants such as The Gap, Ross Stores, Albertsons, and Home Depot also on the list."", ""They anchor properties that also are home to a growing number of smaller stores, all catering to markets that boast an average household income of $152,000, Federal Realty says.That's more than twice the national median, and thus also attractive to trendy new success stories such as Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA).\xa0"", ""While Federal Realty's total returns haven't kept up with those of the S&P 500, of which this REIT is a constituent, if you're talking about reliable passive income, note that Federal Realty's current yield of about 4.2% is nearly triple the average payout of the index."", ""In fact, a better comparison might be to the bond market, which REITs compete with for income-focused investment dollars. Here's how Federal Realty's yield compares over the past 10 years to two different benchmark bond exchange-traded funds."", ""Now, Federal Realty hasn't raised its dividend yet in 2024, of course, since the year has just begun. But it's reasonable to expect it will, and when it does, it probably will be a pretty modest hike. After all, the REIT has raised its payout by only a cent a year since 2020."", ""In the meantime, it seems safe to presume the current management doesn't want to be the team that breaks the long-standing streak of annual increases, which suggests that this stock should provide a stream of recession-safe dividend income for years to come."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Federal Realty Investment Trust right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Federal Realty Investment Trust, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Federal Realty Investment Trust wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Should You Invest in PEP?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $7.55.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PepsiCo.

Firstly, the regular payouts from these stocks assist investors in meeting their immediate liquidity requirements. Secondly, historical data suggests that focusing on dividend-paying investments has the potential to reduce market volatility and mitigate losses during market downturns. Specifically, companies that consistently increase their dividends may offer a level of protection during bearish market conditions. Analyzing the timeframe from December 31, 1999, to March 31, 2022, when the overall market experienced declines, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats demonstrated superior performance compared to both the S&P Composite 1500 and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index. On average, they outperformed by 140 basis points per month and 49 basis points per month, respectively.', 'Strategies centered on dividend growth have the potential to alleviate apprehensions related to the performance of stocks with high dividend payouts in an environment of rising interest rates, as reported by S&P Dow Indices. This is achieved through two key mechanisms. Firstly, as these strategies prioritize consistent dividend increases over high initial yields, their performance is less influenced by the value factor when compared to high dividend-paying stocks. Consequently, the performance of dividend growth strategies is expected to be more resilient in growth-oriented markets. The report highlighted that, considering the emphasis on strong balance sheets, dividend growth strategies might appeal to investors concerned about volatility and the possibility of increasing interest rates. These strategies allow investors to stay engaged in the stock market while also generating income. For those concentrating on U.S. equities, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats are presented as a potential solution for pursuing dividend growth.', ""In 2023, dividend stocks faced a performance decline attributed to the surge in the technology sector. Nevertheless, there is a belief among certain traders that dividend stocks might stage a comeback in the current year. The decline in yields towards the end of 2023 is noted, and there's speculation that this trend could persist, especially if the Federal Reserve opts to reduce interest rates. Larry Adam, the Chief Investment Officer at Raymond James, expressed a preference for dividend stocks within sectors such as technology and healthcare due to their growth potential, as opposed to traditionally defensive categories like utilities.

Sustainability 101 is a blog series that you can turn to for information about different environmental terms that may come up at work, during discussions with friends, and even at your annual holiday gathering."", 'Electricity delivery was simpler 50 years ago than it is today: centralized power stations generated electricity, transmission and distribution networks delivered it to homes and businesses, and the consumer accessed it at the plug. Lights came on when you flipped the switch. Demand peaked at fairly predictable times, like during the evening when workers came home and cooked dinner, adjusted the temperature, watched television and did laundry.', ""Today, electricity grids are more dynamic. Power plants - including solar, wind, and geothermal - can be located at a wide range of locations across the network. Utilities can adjust how much electricity is generated at a given time. They can also reduce demand by remotely turning off or reducing sources of load, including consumers' heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) or refrigeration systems. Lastly, consumers and businesses are using software and devices to manage electricity usage themselves, including smart thermostats that learn what temperature you prefer and adjust settings throughout the day to minimize energy consumption. Consumers can also be producers of energy (e.g. solar) and their consumption patterns can be difficult to predict based on the power they can generate."", 'Cities, regions and countries are creating electricity networks that use digital communications technology to detect and react to local changes in usage (""smart grids""). Digitalization of electric grids is supporting new ways to source and use energy more sustainably while also enhancing cybersecurity.', 'Why are smart grids necessary?', 'Electricity is a perishable commodity, because it must generally be used at the instant it is generated. Moreover, the pathways to deliver it must be built and maintained, and there are limits on how much electricity they can transmit.', 'Think of our electricity system as a series of water pipes:', 'If you try to send too much water through the pipes at a pressure that is too high, you can have floods - or in the case of electricity, delivery interruptions from overloading power lines and related equipment.', 'If you send too little water through, you can have shortages or even drought - or in the case of electricity, the risk of brownouts or even blackouts from inadequate voltage.', 'When power was primarily generated from centralized power plants, that flow was predictable and easier to manage. Newer types of power generation - especially renewable resources like solar and wind farms - are being installed from rooftops to parking garages to mountaintops to cornfields. As a result, the number of power-generating assets has grown significantly, and so has the amount of data that grid operators and utilities have to monitor and take into account.', 'Newer resources like batteries for energy storage and demand response are providing unparalleled new ability to control how power is supplied and load is managed. Regarding smart grids, enhanced data gathering is required to support that level of sophistication and speed.', 'Two-way communications via the Internet of Things', 'Building smart grids starts with adding capabilities to capture more granular data - building out the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT refers to devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies, which connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.', 'For our electricity system, this means utilizing ""smart meters"" that can measure electricity usage much more often. Smart meters can provide your utility with real-time data on electricity use, reducing the need for estimated bills, a change that can save money for consumers. This data can also help utilities improve performance and quality of service in its service area.', ""IoT capabilities are also built into rooftop solar and home battery systems, enabling consumers' equipment to share data with the utility. In some cases, IoT can also enable utilities to send signals in case of extreme weather or disruptions, like a power plant going offline. Similarly, if opted-in, some connected devices can receive signals from your electric utility to adjust settings or turn off for a period of time to help reduce demand on the grid."", ""IoT-enabled building controls are another part of the electricity digitalization puzzle. They can help property managers monitor systems and devices, manage energy use, track occupancy levels to protect occupants' health and safety, and troubleshoot issues."", ""Bringing together data from these disparate IoT resources is requiring more computing power - to compile it, to analyze it and to report on what's happening so that grid operators and utilities can act on it."", 'Two-way power through energy storage and electric vehicles', 'Digitalization is also happening through the adoption of electric vehicles and larger-scale batteries - from residential systems to projects the size of multiple football fields.', ""First, electric vehicles represent a new category of load, drawing more electricity from our grids when they charge. Because people can charge their cars at any time, this adds a new layer of less predictable demand to the system. Conversely, some electric vehicles and chargers are capable of bidirectional charging. This means that if consumers' vehicles are opted-in to utility programs, their batteries could support electric grids at times of high demand or other stress, then resume charging when those conditions end."", ""Large-scale batteries and other types of energy storage are also being deployed in homes, businesses and at grid-scale. Energy storage enables the grid to capture and dispatch energy, which adds flexibility and resilience to electric grids. This is especially important when excess power is generated by solar during the day or by wind at night, so that energy generated isn't wasted."", ""Having more flexible grids that receive granular data on both electricity supply and demand from smart meters can enable operators to accommodate a wider range of resources with different behaviors. On grids powered by a growing percentage of intermittent renewables, granular data can provide utilities with transparency to support customers' needs and reliable power throughout the day."", 'Electric grids & cybersecurity', 'Digitalization of electric grids has a third key leg - enhancing cybersecurity through smart controls that can be accessed faster and remotely.', ""Cybersecurity is part of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 16, which focuses on peace, justice and strong institutions and includes upholding the right to privacy."", 'As IoT devices and smart meters are adopted, they are being manufactured and maintained to high cybersecurity standards. More important, this helps to protect grids from bad actors who might seek to disable them altogether. Enhanced cybersecurity can also help protect the privacy of electricity customers and keep both customer records and usage data safe.', 'How Cisco is advancing digitalization of electricity', 'Our technology can be used to help the world prepare for the outcomes of a changing climate-such as to monitor grid reliability, enable grid decarbonization, monitor transportation and water systems, and support the workplace of the future.', ""For example, Cisco has partnered with Italy's largest electricity provider, Enel, to introduce innovative solutions for agile grid operation, regulation, and supervision. Using Cisco technology, Enel can monitor its energy grid and preemptively address any faults or failures that threaten the network. Cisco is also helping Enel connect its grid to renewable energy sources like solar and wind energy at scale, speeding the transition to a low-carbon electricity grid."", 'In addition, Cisco Meraki sensors, IoT devices that track a range of energy and environmental data, are helping creative agency WPP to reduce energy consumption from heating and cooling in its data center campuses. WPP reports a 44 percent cut in cooling energy and a 27 percent drop in total energy consumption for its data center in Sea Containers House, London, thanks in part to closer monitoring.
