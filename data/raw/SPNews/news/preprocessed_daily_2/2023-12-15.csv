Shares of Disney, they're edging higher in today's trade here. Up about 1% since try and fund management announcing plans to nominate founder, Nelson Peltz, and former Disney CFO, Jay Rasulo, to the media giant's board."", ""So this is a great story, Julie. So basically the news here is that activist investor, Nelson Peltz, plans to nominate himself. That's really important."", 'And this is interesting. The part where they\'re also nominating Jay Rasulo, who was, of course, the former Disney CFO. So this is a guy who, obviously, has a very deep knowledge, background, insight into the company. He is talking tough, by the way. He\'s saying, ""The Disney I know and love has lost its way.""', ""Lots of questions here, obviously. One, is Peltz actually going to be successful here? Pull this off. And in addition, what is Mr. Peltz's plan here? What's his strategy exactly?"", ""Because Bob Iger could say, of course, listen, Nelson, I have been working here. I have been making moves. I've been cost cutting. I've been adding-- listen, we've been adding power hitters to the board. Recently announced, Morgan Stanley's Chief, James Gorman, is joining its board of directors. We'll see how it shakes out."", ""- We'll see how it shakes out. I mean, the stock has recovered a little bit as of late. Although--"", ""- It's about 8%."", ""- You could argue-- it's up 8% this year but it's really bounced like in the month of November, specifically. You could argue that's because of Peltz's involvement and not necessarily because of anything Iger himself is doing. So we'll see how that works out."", ""But as you and I have talked about before, there does seem to be-- it feels like there's a personal element to all of this. That it's not just Peltz's playbook of coming in and really looking in a ruthless or passionless way at the numbers."", 'When you have Rasulo making those kinds of comments-- he left the company after, essentially, he was passed over for promotion-- you have to wonder what else is at play here?', ""- Yeah, I mean Iger-- you know, listen, we talk about this company because it's so fascinating. The future of-- Iger has already-- listen, these issues get streaming to profitability. Of course, the linear TV challenges we talk a lot about. So he has a lot on his plate already and now he's got Nelson Peltz too."", ""- Yes, he does. Let's talk about General Motors as well. The shares are trading-- let's see how they're trading right now. They're up about 6 and 1/2% as it announces layoffs in its autonomous vehicle unit cruise amid a spending pullback on driverless cars."", ""But it's not just a spending pullback on driverless cars, this company-- this unit has had some specific issues, most notably one of its driverless taxis dragging someone, right, recently. And so they had to make some changes linked to that."", '- And regulators stepped in. A lot more heat.', '- So there\'s the demand issue. There\'s just bigger questions about autonomy. And we\'re coming-- this news coming a day after there was a 2 million vehicle recall for Tesla-- or ""recall."" I always put that in quotes because it\'s an over-- the air software update. But, again, tied to autonomous driving.', ""So I think there are bigger questions here. Yes, there's stuff that's specific to cruise but it feels like we're at a moment where there's some bigger questions about where we are with true autonomous driving."", '- Yeah. t remember two GM execs did say, just a few weeks ago, when they reported some color about this, they did say, listen, we expect kind of the pace of cruise expansion is going to be more deliberate. They noted, listen, we understand, trust has to be kind of rebuilt here at this point, with regulators, after these incidents. And they said to expect substantially lower spending at cruise. So they kind of laid it out there for you.', ""- They did lay it out, although it's interesting that the stock is seeing such an upside today, even after they gave some hints that this was going to be happening. Yeah."", ""- And finally, let's turn to Schwab here. Shares of Schwab rising today after the bank reported a rise in core net new assets. So that was the news here, Julie, that the core net new assets for November, 21.7 billion. So that was a pretty big jump month over month."", ""It has not been a great year, if you're long the name. It's down about 15% in 2023. Though we should know, I mean, many of the analysts see better days ahead. You've got about 20 buys on the stock."", '- Yeah, so the story for Schwab this year was that it was caught up in the regional banking crisis. There were concerns about deposit outflows from the company. So this latest month showing that there are some reassurance on that front with those net new assets climbing by the pace that they did.', ""And at the same time that we are hearing this from Schwab, just wanted to mention a broader milestone as well, which is that if you look at regional banks, and Schwab is not a regional bank, per se, but was caught up in that whole thing, we are seeing regional banks come back to the level where they were before the collapse of SVB. We're looking at a couple of the different indices there of those regional banks and we've recovered the losses now that were incurred in the April, May time frame."", ""So it's interesting that Schwab is making this announcement today at the same time that's happening. Emblematic of--"", ""- I mean, to your point-- you're absolutely right. The regional banks-- look at some of those ETFs. They've popped like 20% in four weeks. I mean, it was a big jump."", ""- Yeah. Well, the whole thing, narrative with rates, I guess, hasn't hurt. Although lower rates is sort of a double-edged sword when it comes to the banks."", ""- We've got just the man to talk to coming up on the show later, I believe."", ""- We do. We do. We're going to talk to Gerard Cassidy, and we're going to continue to countdown--"", '- No one better.', ""- Countdown some of the biggest stories of the year. Hopefully, I don't give too much away.""]"

This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Western Digital's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters."", ""Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Western Digital. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 8.1%."", 'Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.', 'While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.', 'The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', ""Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Western Digital Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$66m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. "", ""The general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders."", ""I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Western Digital (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", 'Ultimately the future is most important.

Add rising interest rates, stubbornly low inventory and continued concerns of a looming recession, and it can be downright mindboggling to navigate the market.', 'At U.S. Bank, there are hundreds of mortgage loan originators serving all 50 states who are focused on educating, preparing and helping clients navigate the homebuying process. A top 10 mortgage loan originator in the U.S. by volume, U.S. Bank has been helping individuals and families achieve the dream of homeownership for generations.', ""Overseeing retail home lending at U.S. Bank is Fred Bolstad. He's been in the industry for more than 30 years, experiencing a number of economic cycles that have impacted the confidence and ability for many to buy a home."", 'Bolstad recently sat down to discuss how U.S. Bank is helping potential home buyers continue to pursue their dreams of homeownership despite market conditions.', 'Q. The housing market seems to be in the news almost daily. What are you and your teams seeing on the ground?', ""The combination of the sharp interest rate increases we saw in 2022, paired with inflation, means your money isn't going as far as it used to when buying a home. This has had a particular impact on first-time homebuyers who are feeling priced out of the market, while also facing extremely limited inventory for lower-priced homes."", ""It's a catch-22, but it puts us in a good position to start working with aspiring first-time homebuyers early so they are educated, qualified and prepared to make an offer when the market and their own financial circumstances allow. This leads to sustainable homeownership, which is always our No. 1 goal. It's critically important we focus on helping first-time homebuyers stay in their home and education is not just around loan options, but also the cost of maintaining a home."", 'Q. What opportunity, if any, do current market conditions provide homebuyers?', ""One thing will never change - people will continue to need to move for life changes. Whether it's a new job, retirement or a change in family dynamics, homes will continue to be bought and sold."", 'While market conditions have delayed some aspiring first-time homebuyers from entering the ring, there are more and more down payment assistance programs and products becoming available that can really help potential homebuyers overcome obstacles to buying a home.', 'We launched our own Access Home Loan mortgage product this summer, which provides up to a combined $17,500 in down payment and closing cost assistance. We made this available in 11 initial markets from San Diego and Oakland, California, to Milwaukee and Minneapolis, where there is a significant opportunity to increase homeownership within underserved populations and communities of color.1', 'There are other bank and government programs that have been offered for years that can help income-qualified buyers get into a home with as little as 3% down, or less. These are programs such as the U.S. Bank American Dream Loan, Veteran Affairs (VA) Loan, Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Loan as well as Fannie Mae HomeReady and Freddie Mac Home Possible loans.', ""We've designed a lot of training for our mortgage loan originators to focus on the first-time homebuyer, because there are so many programs and options out there to help. And if a buyer isn't ready yet, we can help them become buyer-ready."", 'Q. How is U.S. Bank helping homebuyers navigate the market?', 'We love when clients come to us when they are in the early stages of thinking about house hunting, so we can help them understand mortgage options in their budget and get them pre-approved.', ""In some cases, a client's credit history, income or existing debt can impact the loan amount and type of loan they qualify for, as well as factors of the mortgage such as down payment needed, interest rate or required mortgage insurance."", ""The great thing about getting a mortgage from a full-service bank is that we can help educate aspiring homebuyers on how to build and improve their credit, optimizing debt and saving for a down payment. We can help clients who aren't buyer-ready when we first connect become buyer-ready."", ""Q. What considerations should homebuyers make in today's market?"", 'Look beyond interest rates: Contrary to what you might believe, your mortgage interest rate may not be the most important factor. There are plenty of numbers that go into a monthly mortgage payment, like the price of the home and the loan term, and an interest rate is only one piece of the puzzle.', ""Make your mortgage loan originator your ally: You don't have to figure this out on your own. Your mortgage loan originator can be your guide in determining which loan options and programs are a good fit for you, and help you determine your timeline to achieving your goal."", ""Buy now, refinance later: This strategy is meant to help buyers who are ready to purchase get into their dream home now, and then potentially refinance in the future when rates drop. It's important to keep in mind that no one can predict if and when rates will drop or by how much. That means for some buyers, rates may never go low enough for a refinance to save them money, so part of sustainable homeownership means making sure that while you can hope for a drop in rates, you are comfortable with your rate over the long term as well."", ""If you're considering this option, discuss it first with your mortgage loan originator. They can help you crunch the numbers and explore the risks versus rewards."", 'Q. Homebuyers have a number of options when it comes to where to get a mortgage. What sets U.S. Bank apart?', 'Most major purchases start with online research, especially house hunting. Not only does U.S. Bank offer digital calculators to help you understand what you can afford and find a loan officer in your area, but the loan process from application to close may be done almost entirely online.', 'In fact, Kiplinger\'s has named us ""Best Mortgage Lender for Digital Tools"" for the last two consecutive years in a row.

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cintas?', ""For Cintas, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.35%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cintas will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cintas would post earnings of $3.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.70, delivering a surprise of +1.37%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Cintas doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

In fact, the last time the yield was this high was during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.', 'The portfolio is heavily focused on retail properties (nearly 80% of rents), and the REIT has a growing portfolio of European assets that add geographic diversification to its portfolio (this is fairly unique in the net lease sector). More conservative investors will probably find Realty Income quite appealing.', 'With a market cap of $110 billion, Prologis is even bigger than Realty Income. That said, it operates exclusively in the industrial sector, with a massive portfolio of warehouses.', 'It is almost hard to fathom the size here, with Prologis owning 1.2 billion square feet of warehouse space across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. The REIT is focused on owning assets in key transportation regions, making it something of a one-stop shop for large customers looking to build a reliable supply chain. Like Realty Income, Prologis has the heft to be an industry consolidator.', ""The dividend yield is a modest 2.9%, but that happens to be toward the high end of the yield range over the past decade. It's probably not as attractively priced as Realty Income, but there's a nuance here. Realty Income's dividend has grown at a roughly 3.8% compound rate over the past 10 years, while Prologis' dividend has grown at 11% annually over that span (with increases in each of the past 10 years). In other words, dividend growth investors might want to take a look at Prologis today."", ""AvalonBay is one of the largest apartment landlords you can buy, with a market cap of about $25 billion.

So far, AvalonBay has proven quite adept at changing with the world around it while keeping its portfolio modern and well-located (largely in and around major U.S. cities).', ""AvalonBay's dividend yield is 3.7%. Like the other two REITs mentioned here, that's toward the high end of the range over the past decade. One notable difference for AvalonBay, however, is that the dividend hasn't been increased every year even though it has trended steadily higher over time. If you can look past that relatively minor difference, the necessity value of apartments, combined with the REIT's size and strong operating history, make AvalonBay an attractive investment choice."", ""While Realty Income, Prologis, and AvalonBay are all around 30% or so below their highs reached in 2022, they have all begun rising off of their recent lows. In other words, Wall Street might be getting more comfortable with the fact that rising interest rates aren't a fatal blow to any of these REITs.

This report focused on revenue estimates, and it looks as though the consensus view of the business has become substantially more conservative.', 'Following the downgrade, the consensus from five analysts covering Gulf Keystone Petroleum is for revenues of US$167m in 2023, implying a sizeable 40% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Before the latest update, the analysts were foreseeing US$199m of revenue in 2023. The consensus view seems to have become more pessimistic on Gulf Keystone Petroleum, noting the substantial drop in revenue estimates in this update.', ' See our latest analysis for Gulf Keystone Petroleum ', ""The consensus price target fell 10% to US$2.36, with the analysts clearly less optimistic about Gulf Keystone Petroleum's valuation following this update. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Gulf Keystone Petroleum, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$3.35 and the most bearish at US$1.25 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that the analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 40% by the end of 2023. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 15% over the last five years. Yet aggregate analyst estimates for other companies in the industry suggest that industry revenues are forecast to decline 1.7% per year. So it's pretty clear that Gulf Keystone Petroleum's revenues are expected to shrink faster than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their revenue estimates for this year. Analysts also expect revenues to shrink faster than the wider market. The consensus price target fell measurably, with analysts seemingly not reassured by recent business developments, leading to a lower estimate of Gulf Keystone Petroleum's future valuation. Often, one downgrade can set off a daisy-chain of cuts, especially if an industry is in decline. So we wouldn't be surprised if the market became a lot more cautious on Gulf Keystone Petroleum after today."", 'Still got questions?

If you want to skip our overview of Mr. Fisher, his hedge fund, growth investing, and the general stock market climate, then you can take a look at 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy Today According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. ', ""Ken Fisher is one of the richest people in the hedge fund industry and the world, with Forbes Magazine estimating his net worth to sit at $7.5 billion as of December 2023. The reason Mr. Fisher is so rich is because he has been investing in the stock market for decades through his hedge fund Fisher Investments. Insider Monkey's research shows that as of September 2023, Fisher's investment portfolio was worth $176 billion - making it one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. Of course, a $176 billion portfolio does not necessarily represent all the capital that investors have placed with Mr. Fisher's hedge fund. In fact, the actual value may be lower since hedge funds often use client money to borrow more money from banks and then invest all of it on the stock market - which often means that the portfolios are worth more than the capital that the hedge fund itself can lay a claim to."", ""2023 has been a great year for Fisher Investments if we consider its portfolio value. This is because as Q3 2022 ended, the firm's investment portfolio was worth $133 billion, leading to a 32% annual growth in 2023. Looking at the stock market's performance in 2023, it's unsurprising why Fisher Investments has been able to grow its investment pie. This year technology stocks have mounted a strong comeback, which has seen the S&P 500 Information Technology index rise by 52% year to date and the flagship technology index, the NASDAQ 100 post 49.87% in returns. Fisher Investment's top three investments in this year's September quarter were Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) - making the portfolio's increase rather self explanatory."", 'For its investment strategies, Fisher Investments targets stock markets in the U.S., Europe, the U.K., emerging markets, and other areas. At the heart of its investment strategy is the belief that an investor must ""must identify information not widely known or interpret widely known information differently and correctly from other market participants."" To exploit this information analysis edge, the hedge fund ""applies proprietary capital markets technology to seek out and process opportunities to exploit such information.""', ""Shifting gears, while others, such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group are sworn value investors that seek to find stocks that are trading lower than their intrinsic value might suggest, Mr. Fisher also dabbles with growth stocks. These stocks are those with high financial ratios that reflect market sentiment about their underlying business model and catalysts that can enable rapid revenue growth in the future. When it comes to selecting growth stocks, while one of the most important ratios that everyone uses is the price to earning (P/E) ratio, it isn't the only one that's used. Another ratio is the price to sales (P/S) ratio, which measures the premium that the market is paying over a firm's net sales."", ""As a testament to Mr. Fisher's contributions to the finance industry, he is the one who actually introduced the P/S ratio. The P/S was introduced to the finance industry in 1984 when Mr. Fisher wrote an article for the American Association of Individual Investors. (AAII). In this article, he likened the P/S ratio to a true indicator of a stock's popularity when compared to the P/E ratio."", 'According to him:', 'Price-sales ratios measure the popularity of the stock. This is helpful for a number of investment theories. A long-held standard of such legendary investors as Warren Buffett, Philip Fisher, Benjamin Graham, John Templeton and others is to buy unpopular stocks of good companies. But first, you must know if a stock is popular or not.', 'It is becoming common to view low price-earnings stocks as synonymous with low popularity. I have nothing against the low price-earnings school and view low price-earnings ratios as a viable way to seek above-average reward at below-average risk. But low price-earnings ratios are not a strong measure of popularity. They are too elastic.', 'Too much attention is focused on current earnings. Earnings are a result—not a cause. At best, they result from a lot of accounting assumptions trickling their way through an operating company’s books. The basic factors affecting the value of a stock tie more closely into the income statement’s top half—a company’s product position and cost structure allowing it to do a certain amount of business. Employing the price-sales ratio as another tool of analysis helps put stocks in their proper perspective.', ""Today, we'll take a look at Ken Fisher's top growth stock picks.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)."", 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the best growth stocks to buy according to Ken Fisher, we ranked his top 32 investments during Q3 2023 by their price to forward earnings ratio and picked out the top stocks.', 'Latest Price To Forward Earnings Ratio: 26.6 ', ""Salesforce, Inc.

Listen in on any corporate earnings call, and you’d hear CEOs like Amazon’s (AMZN) Andy Jassy, Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, Intel’s (INTC) Pat Gelsinger, and AMD’s (AMD) Lisa Su\xa0tout their companies’ AI capabilities.', 'Heck, even Wendy’s (WEN) got in on the action, adding a generative AI assistant to its drive-through in May as part of a test program. The fast-food chain is expanding it to more locations in 2024.', 'AI might have been the most important story of 2023, but it actually started to gain steam in November 2022 when OpenAI released ChatGPT. The chatbot quickly became the fastest-growing app in history to that point, reaching 100 million monthly users in just two months.', 'Nevertheless, here are some of the highlights from the biggest story of 2023: the generative AI explosion.', 'On the heels of ChatGPT’s success, Microsoft, in January, announced it was investing $10 billion in OpenAI over several years. In February, with rumors swirling that Microsoft was set to launch its own AI chatbot powered by ChatGPT, Google debuted its Bard bot. The unveiling, however, was light on details. Days later, Microsoft took the wraps off of its Bing chatbot and new Edge browser. Both Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took the stage, explaining the partnership and how the two companies would bring generative AI to Microsoft’s customers.', 'Google jumped in, opening up access to Bard to a limited number of users. The move was largely seen as a means for Google to keep pace with one of its biggest competitors in the tech space. Not to be outdone, in March, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, announced AI was the company’s largest investment.', 'Google announced that it was bringing together its Brain AI team from Google Research and DeepMind to form a new AI-first organization: Google DeepMind. That same month Amazon announced its Bedrock platform, giving enterprise customers access to generative AI foundation models and its own Titan foundation models.', 'Google kept pouring on the news. It opened up its Bard chatbot to the public. It also launched its Search Generative Experience, a generative AI-powered version of Google Search, during its I/O developer conference. Microsoft then fired back by revealing that it was bringing its AI-powered Windows Copilot to Windows 11. Oh, and Nvidia’s market capitalization briefly topped $1 trillion for the first time, cementing its status as the AI chip leader.', 'As AI continued to generate headlines, the Biden administration announced that it secured agreements from Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to abide by voluntary rules related to AI safety and development. Also in July, Microsoft announced it would charge customers $30 per month per user for its Microsoft 365 Copilot, which adds generative AI capabilities to the company’s productivity suite. The next month, in August, Google responded, saying it will also demand $30 per month, per user for its own generative AI productivity offering, Duet AI for Workspace.', 'Amazon, keen on getting deeper into generative AI, announced it was investing $4 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Meta also revealed it was rolling out AI stickers across its apps and a new AI assistant for WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. It also rolled out AI personalities — featuring celebrities like Tom Brady and Kendall Jenner. Also in September: With rising fears of AI being used in negative ways — and no sign of movement from Congress — the Biden administration signed an executive order seeking to address potential cybersecurity, discrimination, and growth questions related to AI.', 'OpenAI hosted its first developer event in November, unveiling a more powerful version of GPT-4 called GPT-4 Turbo and an app store for ChatGPT called the GPT Store. (That\'s where customers can buy customized versions of the company’s AI software.) Then all hell broke loose at OpenAI. The board fired CEO Sam Altman seemingly out of nowhere. Microsoft stepped in and offered him a job, hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to resign, and OpenAI finally brought back Altman with some new board members, including a nonvoting ""observer"" role for Microsoft. Meanwhile, Amazon announced its own Q chatbot to better compete with the likes of Microsoft and Google.', 'December:', 'Finally, this month, Google unveiled its GPT-4 competitor Gemini.', 'And here’s the thing, that’s not even all of the AI news that made headlines this year.

Here are three unstoppable AI stocks to buy and hold for the next decade (listed in alphabetical order).', ""Anyone who thought that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) would be left in the dust in the AI race is probably rethinking that position now. Admittedly, the company appeared to be blindsided by the early success of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

The most powerful version of the model, Gemini Ultra, outperforms OpenAI's GPT-4 and beats human experts on the MMLU (massive multitask language understanding) test."", ""I think that Google Cloud will return to its previous growth trajectory, thanks to Gemini. Even if that's overly optimistic, the company's cloud platform should have huge growth prospects as customers flock to the cloud to build generative AI apps."", ""What about the possibility that Alphabet's search business could be disrupted by AI? I predict that it will -- but not in the way that some envision. My view is that search won't be replaced by AI. Instead, I expect that Google's use of AI will enhance its search functionality and make it more profitable."", ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was another AI leader that appeared to have been initially caught off guard by ChatGPT's popularity. Like Alphabet, though, the e-commerce and cloud services giant quickly rolled out its own generative AI capabilities."", 'My take is that Amazon is on the right track with Amazon Bedrock. This service allows Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to quickly build generative AI apps with a range of tools at their disposal.', 'I\'m also in full agreement with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy about the long-term potential for AWS because of AI.

I anticipate that those profits will continue to grow robustly for years to come as the company harnesses the power of AI across all of its businesses."", ""My inclusion of Alphabet and Amazon among the unstoppable AI stocks to buy and hold doesn't mean that I think they'll grow at the expense of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). That's not the case at all. I believe that Microsoft will remain one of the biggest AI winners for a long time to come."", ""Microsoft's significant investment in OpenAI could go down as one of the smartest business development moves in corporate history. The two companies are now joined at the hip. And it shows with OpenAI's GPT-4 technology integrated throughout Microsoft's products."", ""I'm not concerned about the recent soap opera with the firing and prompt rehiring of Sam Altman as OpenAI's CEO. OpenAI -- and Microsoft, by extension -- will almost certainly continue to pioneer AI breakthroughs."", 'Like Alphabet and Amazon, Microsoft is poised to profit tremendously as customers move their apps and data to the cloud.

The upshot of that momentum is that the Dow Jones reached a record high on Wednesday, meaning the blue chip index just entered bull market territory.', 'Past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but crossing the bull market threshold has historically been a good sign for stocks.', 'The Dow Jones has run through eight bull markets in the last 50 years.

But the current bull market technically started when the Dow Jones bottomed in October 2022. The index has since climbed about 27%, bringing the implied upside down to roughly 110% over four years from today's levels."", 'However, returns have varied dramatically between past bull markets, so investors would do better to benchmark against a different metric. Specifically, the Dow Jones returned about 9% annually over the past four decades, and its performance will likely be similar over the next four decades.', 'Investors looking to capitalize on that should consider buying some of the more promising blue chip stocks in the Dow Jones.

Similarly, Microsoft is the leader in enterprise software-as-a-service and operates the second-largest cloud computing platform; those markets are also projected to grow by 14% annually through the end of the decade.', 'Building on that, Salesforce and Microsoft are leaning into the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss argues Microsoft in particular is the software company best positioned to monetize generative AI. But both could be long-term winners as more businesses seek productivity gains through automation.', 'Alternatively, investors could take a more conservative approach and buy shares of the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEMKT: DIA).', 'The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is an index fund that tracks all 30 blue chip stocks in the Dow Jones, meaning it provides exposure to some of the most economically influential U.S. companies.

The index fund bears a below-average expense ratio of 0.16%, meaning the annual fee on a $10,000 portfolio would be $16.', ""Here's the bottom line: The Dow Jones has consistently created wealth over long periods of time, and I'd bet my bottom dollar that trend continues in the future.

And if you\'re not going to do a job, don\'t do a job. And, you know, it\'s kind of like if you\'re going to get into something, get after it.

In 2011, Ballmer helped pull together the $8.5 billion acquisition of online communication company Skype — years before remote work became a thing.', '""I used to pride myself on my awareness and ability to think about my environment and hard work,"" Ballmer said, adding that listening to others has also been a key ingredient in his leadership journey.', ""Ballmer's tenure atop Microsoft wasn't without a few challenges, however."", 'The company ceded the mobile phone market to rival Apple (AAPL) and entered the search engine market late with the release of Bing in 2009.', 'Ballmer went on to announce his departure from Microsoft in August 2013.', ""Over Ballmer's 13-year tenure as CEO, Microsoft shares lost about 30% of their value, while the S&P 500 rose roughly 22%."", ""But a challenging final few years at Microsoft didn't slow Ballmer down. Quite the contrary."", ""In May 2014, Ballmer purchased the LA Clippers for a reported $2 billion. Forbes estimated the team is now worth $4.65 billion, the fifth most valuable in the league. The team has had winning seasons each year under Ballmer's ownership, in part because of his willingness to invest in the organization."", 'And in 2017, Ballmer launched USAFacts to share insight into how the country is being run — something not accurately reflected in typical government data, he contends.', ""Next year, he will open the LA Clippers' new home, dubbed the Intuit Dome. In classic Ballmer form, he told Yahoo Finance he has been very active in the stadium's designs and overall fan experience."", ""Ballmer says he isn't keen on thinking about his legacy and hopes to be remembered for his leadership and philanthropic endeavors."", '""If you say outside of my kids and my family and my friendships, what will I feel most proud about? I mean, it\'s going to be that I was employee 30 at Microsoft and really [helped make] Microsoft the company it is. I feel a lot of pride in having led that. And I think it creates jobs. We helped change the world. The company keeps changing the world. [There\'s a] good successor in place, who\'s taken the company to higher heights. I have a lot of pride in that.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paychex would post earnings of $1.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.14, delivering a surprise of +1.79%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Paychex doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

It's the only fine that the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has levied against Xcel over the leaks, agency spokesman Stephen Mikkelson said."", 'The Monticello plant is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis, upstream from the city on the Mississippi River.', 'Xcel had already installed and filled more than 20 temporary tanks when MPCA staff informed the company in March of 2023 that adding an additional tank would require a permit because it would raise their total capacity over 1 million gallons (3.8 million liters) to just over 1.4 million gallons (5.3 million liters). But Xcel began filling the new tank in April before it obtained the required permit, the agency said in a statement.', 'The MPCA granted the permit in May, and it required the use of the temporary tanks to end by Nov. 1. The Minneapolis-based utility has since transferred the contaminated water to more permanent in-ground lined storage ponds and dismantled the temporary tanks, and says it continues to recover and reuse the contaminated water that leaked from the plant.', '“We have resolved the issue and have taken all necessary corrective actions outlined by state regulators,” Xcel spokesman Kevin Coss said.', ""Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen and is a common by-product of nuclear plant operations. It emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel very far and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A person who drank water from a spill would get only a low dose. The NRC says tritium spills happen from time to time but typically don't affect public health or safety."", 'Nevertheless, Xcel and the MPCA came under criticism for not notifying the public until March, well after the first spill, after a second leak was discovered at the site, leading to a week-long shutdown. Xcel, which has recovered most of the tritium, has built an underground metal barrier to ensure that no contaminated groundwater reaches the river after low levels of tritium were discovered within 30 feet (9 meters) of it.', '“Tritium measurements on site are more than 90% lower than peak readings, and tritium has not been detected in the Mississippi River despite increased monitoring,” Coss said.', 'Testing by the Minnesota Department of Health still shows no evidence of tritium in the river, Mikkelson agreed.', '“There remains no risk to public health and no immediate impacts to the safety of drinking water or private wells,” he said.']"

And if we do do that with the terminal rate for Fed funds, this is shaping up to look like 1995 when the stocks are up 55% that year."", ""So those are the two main factors. But also, the long end of the curve, the 10-year government Treasury, in October, was up against 5%. There was talk of maybe 6% in the 10-year. And today it broke 4% on the downside. That's been another factor for that move as well."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Gerard, when you look at rates, though, is that on balance, a headwind or a tailwind, rates coming down, that is?', ""GERARD CASSIDY: I would say it's a tailwind, because, if rates come down, the economy is going to be stronger. And we always have to remember in bank stock investing, credit trumps interest rates. And so if rates were to come down and refinancing activity picks up at the long end of the curve, if the Fed-- we don't want the Fed cutting too aggressively, because that would suggest maybe the economy is weaker than expected."", ""But if you get one or two Fed fund rate cuts in 2024, the yield curve starts to come down a bit, that's very positive for the banks, because the credit picture really improves. And when you talk to investors today, many long lonelies, their number one concern about owning a bank stock going into '24 is the fear of credit problems. And if you start taking that off the table, the stocks are going to work better. So lower rates would be positive in our view because it suggests credit won't be that material of a problem.""]"

This move has caught the attention of investors and market analysts, as insider transactions can often provide valuable insights into a company's prospects and the sentiment of its top executives.Who is Scott Garrett of Hologic Inc?Scott Garrett is known for his role as a director at Hologic Inc, a leading developer, manufacturer, and supplier of diagnostic products, medical imaging systems, and surgical products focused on women's health and well-being. With a career that spans various leadership positions in the healthcare industry, Garrett's actions in the market are closely watched. His experience and understanding of the company's operations make his trading activities a point of interest for those following Hologic's stock.Hologic Inc's Business DescriptionHologic Inc is a global healthcare and diagnostics company with a strong emphasis on women's health. The company's portfolio includes technologies for breast health, diagnostics, GYN surgical health, and skeletal health. Hologic's products are designed to help with early detection and treatment of diseases, contributing to improved patient outcomes. The company's commitment to innovation and patient care has positioned it as a leader in the medical technology field.Analysis of Insider Buy/Sell and the Relationship with the Stock PriceInsider transactions, such as the recent sale by Scott Garrett, can be a double-edged sword when it comes to interpreting their impact on a company's stock price. On one hand, a sale might indicate that the insider believes the stock is fully valued or potentially overvalued, prompting them to lock in profits. On the other hand, insiders might sell shares for personal reasons that have no bearing on their outlook for the company.In the case of Hologic Inc, the insider transaction history over the past year shows a pattern of more sells than buys among insiders. Specifically, there have been 0 insider buys and 7 insider sells. This could suggest that insiders, on balance, have been more inclined to sell their shares than to acquire more."", ""When analyzing Scott Garrett's recent sale of 10,000 shares, it's important to consider the context of his trading history. Over the past year, Garrett has sold a total of 20,000 shares and has not made any purchases. This continued selling trend might raise questions about his long-term confidence in the company's stock performance.Valuation and Market ReactionOn the day of the insider's recent sale, shares of Hologic Inc were trading at $68.71, giving the company a market cap of $17.061 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 38.85 is higher than both the industry median of 30.715 and Hologic's historical median, suggesting a premium valuation compared to its peers and its own past.Moreover, with a price of $68.71 and a GuruFocus Value of $61.32, Hologic Inc has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.12. This indicates that the stock is modestly overvalued based on its GF Value."", ""The GF Value is a proprietary metric developed by GuruFocus, taking into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates from analysts. When the price-to-GF-Value ratio exceeds 1, it suggests that the stock may be overvalued relative to its intrinsic value.ConclusionThe recent insider sale by Scott Garrett at Hologic Inc aligns with a broader trend of insider selling over the past year. While this could be a signal for investors to proceed with caution, it's also crucial to consider the broader market conditions and the company's fundamentals. Hologic's position as a leader in women's health, along with its innovative product lineup, continues to provide a strong foundation for growth.However, the current valuation metrics and the modest overvaluation based on the GF Value suggest that the stock's price may have limited upside potential in the near term. Investors should weigh these factors, along with the insider selling trend, when making decisions about their investment in Hologic Inc. As always, a diversified portfolio and a focus on long-term financial goals are key to navigating the complexities of the stock market."", 'Warning!

That way, you don't have to stress about hitting the store or spending money on Instacart fees all the time."", ""A Walmart+ membership could also make a lot of sense if you're thinking about ditching your car in 2024. If you work remotely and really only need a car for the purpose of running errands, then it can be far more cost-effective to just Uber your way to the store when you need to rather than pay to maintain and insure a vehicle.

So if you're someone who tends to place a lot of online orders at Walmart, now, you won't need to worry about meeting an order minimum to qualify for free shipping."", ""Do keep in mind that Walmart+ differs a bit from Amazon Prime in that with the latter, you get free two-day shipping on your orders. With Walmart+, your items might take longer to arrive.

If you want to skip our overview of Mr. Fisher, his hedge fund, growth investing, and the general stock market climate, then you can take a look at 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy Today According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. ', ""Ken Fisher is one of the richest people in the hedge fund industry and the world, with Forbes Magazine estimating his net worth to sit at $7.5 billion as of December 2023. The reason Mr. Fisher is so rich is because he has been investing in the stock market for decades through his hedge fund Fisher Investments. Insider Monkey's research shows that as of September 2023, Fisher's investment portfolio was worth $176 billion - making it one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. Of course, a $176 billion portfolio does not necessarily represent all the capital that investors have placed with Mr. Fisher's hedge fund. In fact, the actual value may be lower since hedge funds often use client money to borrow more money from banks and then invest all of it on the stock market - which often means that the portfolios are worth more than the capital that the hedge fund itself can lay a claim to."", ""2023 has been a great year for Fisher Investments if we consider its portfolio value. This is because as Q3 2022 ended, the firm's investment portfolio was worth $133 billion, leading to a 32% annual growth in 2023. Looking at the stock market's performance in 2023, it's unsurprising why Fisher Investments has been able to grow its investment pie. This year technology stocks have mounted a strong comeback, which has seen the S&P 500 Information Technology index rise by 52% year to date and the flagship technology index, the NASDAQ 100 post 49.87% in returns. Fisher Investment's top three investments in this year's September quarter were Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) - making the portfolio's increase rather self explanatory."", 'For its investment strategies, Fisher Investments targets stock markets in the U.S., Europe, the U.K., emerging markets, and other areas. At the heart of its investment strategy is the belief that an investor must ""must identify information not widely known or interpret widely known information differently and correctly from other market participants."" To exploit this information analysis edge, the hedge fund ""applies proprietary capital markets technology to seek out and process opportunities to exploit such information.""', ""Shifting gears, while others, such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group are sworn value investors that seek to find stocks that are trading lower than their intrinsic value might suggest, Mr. Fisher also dabbles with growth stocks. These stocks are those with high financial ratios that reflect market sentiment about their underlying business model and catalysts that can enable rapid revenue growth in the future. When it comes to selecting growth stocks, while one of the most important ratios that everyone uses is the price to earning (P/E) ratio, it isn't the only one that's used. Another ratio is the price to sales (P/S) ratio, which measures the premium that the market is paying over a firm's net sales."", ""As a testament to Mr. Fisher's contributions to the finance industry, he is the one who actually introduced the P/S ratio. The P/S was introduced to the finance industry in 1984 when Mr. Fisher wrote an article for the American Association of Individual Investors. (AAII). In this article, he likened the P/S ratio to a true indicator of a stock's popularity when compared to the P/E ratio."", 'According to him:', 'Price-sales ratios measure the popularity of the stock. This is helpful for a number of investment theories. A long-held standard of such legendary investors as Warren Buffett, Philip Fisher, Benjamin Graham, John Templeton and others is to buy unpopular stocks of good companies. But first, you must know if a stock is popular or not.', 'It is becoming common to view low price-earnings stocks as synonymous with low popularity. I have nothing against the low price-earnings school and view low price-earnings ratios as a viable way to seek above-average reward at below-average risk. But low price-earnings ratios are not a strong measure of popularity. They are too elastic.', 'Too much attention is focused on current earnings. Earnings are a result—not a cause. At best, they result from a lot of accounting assumptions trickling their way through an operating company’s books. The basic factors affecting the value of a stock tie more closely into the income statement’s top half—a company’s product position and cost structure allowing it to do a certain amount of business. Employing the price-sales ratio as another tool of analysis helps put stocks in their proper perspective.', ""Today, we'll take a look at Ken Fisher's top growth stock picks.

We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable.

The much-anticipated acknowledgment of a decelerating inflation trend lifted the leading benchmark indices to 52-week highs and propelled them to record tallies.While the S&P crossed 4,700 for the first time since January 2022, the Dow closed above the 37,000 mark — exceeding a previous record set in the same month. This buoyed the ongoing Santa Claus rally that was fueled by solid jobs and consumer price index data. The November non-farm payrolls report showed that the jobless rate fell to 3.7% from 3.9% in the prior month. The economy also added 199,000 jobs compared with 150,000 job additions in October, signifying economic strength.The consumer price index was up 3.1% in November on a year-over-year basis and 0.1% month over month. The latest GDP data also revealed that the economy grew in the third quarter at a stronger-than-forecast annual rate of 5.2%.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, Thomson Reuters Corporation TRI, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Cboe Global Markets, Inc. CBOE and Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.', 'ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.', ""In order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture.

If you want to skip our overview of the energy industry and the latest news, then you can take a look at 5 Most Profitable Energy Stocks. ', 'The energy industry is once again at the center of global attention as 2023 comes to a close. This is because of the COP28 climate conference in Dubai, where governments from nearly every country on the planet agreed to a climate deal after two weeks of intense negotiations. The past two years have been full of dynamism for oil industry participants and investors, as the oil climate surged to feverish pitches in 2022, nearly two years after global demand snapped in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.', ""Year to date, the S&P 500 Energy index is down by 7.31% due to lax demand in a tight industrial environment influenced by high interest rates and persistent inflation. The fall is unsurprising when we take a look at the revenue trends for some of the biggest energy companies in the world, such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL). For instance, Exxon's trailing twelve month revenue currently sits at $346 billion to mark a substantial drop over 2022's figures of $398.6 billion. Similarly, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, Aramco, has witnessed a 200 billion Saudi Riyal revenue drop between its 2022 revenue and the TTM figures for September 2023. However, even as the oil companies' revenues stagger now, over the past three or four years, they have demonstrated remarkable growth."", ""Sticking with Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company brought in SAR1.2 trillion in revenue during 2019, so even though its TTM figures of SAR2 trillion are lower than 2022 sales, they have nearly doubled since the last normal year before COVID-19's full impact on global energy markets. In a similar vein, Exxon raked in $264 billion in 2019, to lead its September 2023 TTM revenue to mark a respectable 31% growth."", ""Therefore, it's clear that even as global delegates wrack their brains to figure out how to save the planet from carbon emissions, big oil is ticking along to ensure that economies can continue to grow. At the same time, global oil prices are weaker, as investors fine tune their 2024 demand prospects keeping the high rates limiting growth right now in mind. In its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) commented on the price trends for oil in November. The organization measures global crude oil prices through its OPEC Reference Basket, or the ORB."", 'In November, ORB dropped by 7.5% month over month to close at $84.92 per barrel. According to OPEC, at the heart of this rather high price drop was widespread speculation in the market driven by the strategies that hedge funds and other financial trading institutions typically engage in to make a return. It shared that the funds and money managers turned bearish about the market in November and started to offload their bullish positions.', 'In its report, the OPEC shares:', 'Crude oil futures prices experienced a significant downturn, marked by heavy selloffs amidst a highly volatile futures market. Speculators played a major role in this trend, cutting their bullish positions sharply while increasing short positions. The market dynamic was fuelled by exaggerated concerns about oil demand growth, which negatively impacted market sentiment. The ICE Brent front-month averaged $6.67, or 7.5%, m-o-m lower in November to stand at $82.03/b, and the NYMEX WTI fell by $8.09, or 9.5%, m-o-m to average $77.38/b. DME Oman crude oil futures prices decreased in November by $6.25, or 7.0%, m-o-m to settle at $83.06/b. Hedge funds and other money managers turned more bearish about crude oil, closing a large volume of bullish futures and options positions, specifically in the NYMEX WTI market. At the same time, they raised bearish positions for nine consecutive weeks to the week of 28 November. This has fuelled volatility and accelerated the decline in oil futures prices. Between late October and the week of 28 November, hedge funds and other money managers sold an equivalent of 89 mb, after liquidating an equivalent of 204 mb in the previous month.', ""Considering the recent trends in the oil industry and the return to normal after 2022's high revenues, we decided to see which energy companies remain the most profitable. While the energy sector is typically dominated by oil companies due to the fuel's near ubiquity in the global economy, as a whole it also made of other firms belonging to sectors such as power generation and clean energy."", 'A rig pumping oil in the midst of a sun-baked desert.', 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the most profitable energy stocks, we ranked the 25 biggest energy and utility companies that trade on the NYSE and the NASDAQ stock exchanges by their market capitalization and picked out those with the highest trailing twelve month net income as the most profitable energy stocks.', 'Latest TTM Net Income: $7.6 billion ', 'NextEra Energy, Inc.

Yesterday's Federal Reserve meeting and the expectation of lower interest rates in 2024 and 2025 have given the market a boost and energy assets have become some of the favorites today."", 'Both NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and its subsidiary NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) jumped as much as 3.3% and 8.5%, respectively, in morning trading. More direct renewable energy companies were also up sharply with QuantumScape (NYSE: QS) rising 11.9%, SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) jumping 20.9%, and Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) gaining 15.5%. At 1 p.m. ET, shares of all five stocks are near their daily highs.', ""The Federal Reserve said it will keep short-term rates flat for now, but it doesn't control long-term rates that provide a benchmark for corporate borrowing. Those are set by the open market."", 'After falling sharply yesterday, the 10-year yield fell another 10 basis points for U.S. government bonds, 20 basis points in Mexico, and between 5 and 14 basis points in Europe. Clearly, the financing environment will get less expensive for companies building renewable energy projects.', 'This has two impacts on renewable energy companies and stocks. One is the market moving to riskier assets as yields fall, which pushes up the value of stocks like QuantumScape and Plug Power that are still very speculative. Second, lower rates will make investment in the projects more compelling. Just like with a mortgage, lower rates mean lower monthly payments and better margins for installers.', ""It's important now to understand the difference between the companies that will benefit directly from lower interest rates and where rates will be a more indirect tailwind."", ""Companies financing projects like NextEra Energy, NextEra Energy Partners, and SunPower are going to benefit from lower rates and that benefit could hit in the next few quarters. NextEra Energy Partners specifically fell in 2023 because investors were concerned that it wouldn't be able to refinance project debt at attractive terms, but that concern has likely gone away as rates have dropped. I would expect management to lock in some of the current rate drop in the next few quarters to reduce long-term risk."", 'SunPower drops projects down to its financing partners and the current rate environment should lead to higher margins relatively quickly. Volume may take a while to pick up, but there will be a noticeable tailwind from interest rates in 2024, just like there was a headwind in 2023.', ""Companies like QuantumScape and Plug Power are in a more precarious position. They need customers to buy their systems and finance them, so they're not directly benefiting from lower rates. And while utilities or auto companies may be interested in their technology, those customers are now also thinking about the risk they have in taking on new technology and the interest rate risk that flared up in 2023. As a result, benefits may take much longer to materialize and that's why their current losses are a big concern."", 'Expect interest rates to be a hot topic for the renewable energy industry throughout 2024, and if rates keep falling it would be very bullish for the industry.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy Partners wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to the 5 Countries with Biggest Carbon Footprint per Capita.', 'Carbon footprint refers to the amount of greenhouse gases, expressed in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), emitted by an individual, organization, or region. It provides us with an estimate of the GHG emissions in our environment. It can be used as an indicator to assess the environmental performance of countries.', 'According to the ""CO2 in 2022 Emissions"" report by the International Energy Agency, the global energy landscape went through an interplay between the rising green transformation wave and the tenacious fossil fuels grip. The world witnessed a CO2 emission increase of 0.9%, posing serious environmental and ecological threats.', 'Fossil fuels are the primary drivers of GHG emissions leading to global warming and consequently climate change. The low cost of fossil fuels makes it a preferable choice for industries involved in the manufacturing of fossil fuel-derived goods including fuel, plastic, and oil, among others. While fossil fuels offer great immediate monetary benefits, they are proving to be a deceptive bargain in the long run. Coal is the dominant player in the fossil fuel market exhibiting a 1.6% increase, resulting in a record high 15.5 giga tonnes of emissions. Oil and gas emissions also witnessed a high growth of 2.5% and 1.8% respectively.', ""Among the world's largest emitter, China displayed a stable overall emissions output. Europe is leading the green policy with its transformation to environment-friendly alternatives. In 2022, it achieved a significant 2.5% reduction in its emissions. The US, on the other hand, witnessed a 0.8% surge in its emissions. Emissions from developing economies in Asia experienced a 4.2% or 206 Mt CO2 surge in emissions more than any other region."", ""Cutting down global emissions demands a shift toward clean energy and renewable energy technology, fueled by increased investment to combat climate change. Renewable energy technology offers resource efficiency, waste reduction, and material closed-loops, aligning with the principles of the circular economy. In 2022, the green technology exhibited remarkable agility, producing 275 TWh and powering 90% of the world's new electricity generation. This feat represents the burgeoning renewable energy market and its growth potential. Let's have a look at the renewable energy market and the major players operating in the industry. You can also look at the top renewable energy companies in the world."", 'According to a report by Precedence Market Research, the global renewable energy market was worth $970 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.5% and reach $2.18 trillion in 2032. The growth can be attributed to various renewable energy sources including hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal, and bioenergy. In 2022, renewable energy had a 7% share in the global energy demand. The share is expected to continue growing over the coming years. Other factors boosting the market growth include increasing awareness of fossil fuel impacts, rising initiatives by the government to promote clean energy, growing efforts to offset carbon emissions, and increased adoption of green energy.', 'Regionally, Asia Pacific dominated the market with a share of over 35% in 2022. This is due to the rapid urbanization leading to high pollution levels in the region, resulting in a high demand for renewable energy solutions. The market is experiencing significant growth in emerging economies such as India and China, driven by the economic growth due to rising industrialization in the countries. North America is expected to be the fastest-growing region over the forecasted period, driven by growing awareness of environmental catastrophes, increasing government initiatives to cut down emissions, and rising investments in renewable energy sources. You can also take a look at some of the major renewable energy companies operating in the US.', 'Some of the major players in the market include NextEra Energy, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and National Grid plc (NYSE:NGG).', 'NextEra Energy, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:NEE) is a leading renewable energy company, specializing in solar and wind energy. On October 24, the company reported earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) reported an EPS of $0.94 and beat estimates by $0.06. The company reported revenue of $7.17 billion for the quarter, up by 6.74% year-over-year.', ""Here are some of the comments from NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:NEE) Q3 2023 earnings call:"", '""Energy resources had a record quarter of new renewables and storage origination at approximately 3,245 megawatts to the backlog, which is the first time we have exceeded three gigawatts in a single quarter. Although we will remind you that signings can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, we do believe this is a terrific sign of strong underlying demand for new renewable generation. With these additions, our backlog now totals over 21 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 1,025 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our second quarter call. We also removed roughly 1,180 megawatts from our backlog, including roughly 800 megawatts of projects in New York following an adverse decision by NYSERDA two weeks ago. We are optimistic that these projects will ultimately move forward, but are removing them from backlog for now.', 'The remaining megawatts were removed due to permitting challenges. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our renewable development expectations of roughly 33 gigawatts to 42 gigawatts through 2026. This quarter\'s backlog additions include roughly 455 megawatts to repower existing wind facilities, which includes energy resources share of approximately 740 megawatts of repowers within the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio, which I\'m going to discuss in a few minutes. As a reminder, in a repower, we invest roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build, are able to refresh and enhance the performance of the turbine equipment, and start a new 10 years of production tax credits, collectively resulting in attractive returns. Energy Resources has previously repowered roughly 6 gigawatts of its approximately 23 gigawatt operating wind portfolio, and we believe we will be able to repower much of our existing wind portfolio in the coming years.""', ""Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a major US electric power and gas holding company.

A decelerating macroeconomic framework is adding headwinds to already slowing energy demand growth, while geopolitical events in several regions either reduce energy supply or raise the risks of supply disruptions.', 'For oil markets, an extended period of elevated crude prices hastened investment and activity outside of OPEC+, with production growth accelerating robustly, particularly in the United States, creating an unclear future for supply cuts within OPEC+.', 'Kurt Barrow, Head of Oil Markets, S&P Global Commodity Insights, said:\xa0""Strong non-OPEC+ supply growth and slowing oil demand growth have led OPEC and its allies to curtail output and support prices. While this tactic has achieved some success, maintaining discipline among member countries may be difficult in 2024 as the loss of market share continues and non-OPEC+ volumes increase. OPEC+\'s ability to follow through on voluntary production cuts will be key to crude pricing over the next year.""', 'While global gas markets have managed to adjust to sharply lower Russian gas supply, particularly to Europe, demand remains constrained due to high prices and the macroeconomic slowdown.', 'Global coal demand, which saw stout growth in 2023 due to underperforming hydro generation in China, is set to see slower growth or demand decline in 2024.', 'Philippe Frangules, Head of Gas, Power & Climate Solutions, S&P Global Commodity Insights, said: ""Looking ahead, gas consumers in Europe and Asia remain exposed to shortages if winter weather proves to be cold, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) logistics will be key to meeting regional demand. Similarly, coal producers are faced with rightsizing their output and flows this year, as pockets of demand strength remain in developing countries even if global demand is past its peak. Prices for both gas and coal should ease in 2024 barring unforeseen events.""', 'Attention and investment in the energy transition has clearly heightened over the past year, with project developers scrambling to grab unprecedented financial incentives from governments. While well-publicized supply chain constraints have already started to clear, clean technology development is exhibiting some growing pains, ranging from higher capital expenditure estimates, excess inventories, and high interest rates.', 'The impact of the economics of decarbonization on international trade and investment will become more apparent in 2024, as China seeks to export its clean technology while international producers look to qualify for incentives in the US under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Europe is looking to both protect its domestic industry from imports from countries that do not impose stringent environmental standards as well as project European carbon pricing policy across the globe by unveiling the specifics of its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and adding shipping into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).', 'Simon Thorne, Climate & Energy Transformation Lead, S&P Global Commodity Insights, said:\xa0""While the security of oil and gas supply will remain paramount to many countries, the world is focusing more and more on securing source materials for clean energy technology, battery metals, and renewables.""', 'TOP TEN KEY THEMES TO THE 2024 ENERGY OUTLOOK: S&P GLOBAL COMMODITY INSIGHTS:\xa0', 'Energy demand searching for a new normal but will be hard-pressed to find it. Once fairly steady due to relatively predictable economic and population growth, energy demand has been subject to unprecedented volatility since the new decade began. From the staggering level of demand destruction from the COVID pandemic and the uneven geographic and sectoral recovery from it, to the repercussions of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, market participants may be wondering what ""normal"" demand growth looks like. The delayed recoveries from COVID in China and in the aviation sector are now essentially complete and markets have generally adjusted to altered flows of Russian energy, but there still are several wildcards for demand in 2024:', 'Central banks face the continued challenge of reining in inflation without damaging economic growth.', ""China's economic slowdown could cause ripples across the region and the globe."", 'Questions remain around the recovery of European power and gas demand, approaching two years since the start of the Ukraine conflict.', '2024 will be an El Niño year, with a 30% chance that the weather phenomenon could be historically intense. Against a background of rising global temperatures, a strong El Niño could drive extreme weather on both sides of the Pacific (and beyond), amplifying swings in energy demand and increasing the likelihood of a more active hurricane season.', ""Coal demand likely peaked in 2023; global consumption to start declining in 2024. Growth in renewables and other clean technology grabbed the headlines in 2023, but the use of coal quietly grew in the background, with consumption likely hitting a new annual record in 2023. The strength in global demand was driven by China's delayed economic recovery from COVID combined with underperforming hydro generation. In 2024, an expected rebound in Chinese hydro generation, a continued renewables buildout, and slower electricity load growth should see Chinese coal demand growth decelerate notably from 2023 levels. Coal demand will assuredly grow in India and other developing nations in 2024, but with weaker Chinese coal growth the continued structural decline in demand in the US, Europe, and other industrialized nations, global demand very likely has peaked. However, coal often is the fuel to backfill for underperforming renewables, when natural gas is too expensive or unavailable and if overall energy demand is higher than anticipated. As a result, another year or two of growth is not completely out of the question."", 'One in five cars sold in 2024 will be electric, putting global gasoline demand on the edge of its peak. Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) have surged over the past several years, stimulated by subsidies and tax incentives. However, EVs have become cost competitive in some markets without subsidies and automakers are offering a significantly larger and more diverse portfolio of new EV models and sales growth is starting to hit another gear. More than a million new EVs are taking to the roads every month, and EV penetration of new vehicle sales is now over 30% in China, over 20% in Europe, and over 10% in the US. S&P Global Commodity Insights projects that EV sales penetration will reach 20% globally in 2024, fueled by a significant increase in the US related to the Inflation Reduction Act and new models on offer. This influx of new EVs – combined with sustained improvements in the fleet ICE vehicle fuel efficiencies – will slow gasoline demand growth to less than 300,000 b/d in 2024, and that this may be the last year of global growth for the fuel.', 'Massive growth in North American oil and natural gas supply growth to continue. Due in large part to strong oil prices, US oil and gas production surged to new record levels in 2023. The US now produces around 22 million barrels per day (b/d) of total liquids, growing by 1.3 million b/d in 2023 alone. Even assuming weaker oil prices and a slowdown in new drilling going forward, there is sufficient momentum already in place to see nearly 1 million b/d of growth in 2024 due to increased rig efficiency and longer laterals. With Canadian liquids expanding by nearly 0.4 million b/d, North American liquids supply growth is expected – on its own – to meet over 85% of global demand growth in 2024. Despite low Henry Hub gas prices in 2023, and a pullback in gas-oriented drilling, lower-48 natural gas production will reach 103.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2024, up by 4.3 Bcf/d due to strong oil prices stimulating associated gas production. Production growth is expected to slow but remain positive in 2024, which will continue the push for higher LNG and pipeline exports.', ""OPEC+ and other producers in a difficult position. Throughout 2023, faced with increasing North American liquids production as well as growth elsewhere in non-OPEC+ (Brazil, China, Norway, Mexico & Guyana), OPEC+ chose to cut production quotas in order to defend prices. While these curtailments have kept and are keeping headline crude oil prices from falling below $80/b until likely late in 2024, OPEC's market share has fallen to its lowest point in recent memory. Already, unity within OPEC+ appears to be fracturing, with members only able to agree on voluntary cuts at the delayed November 2023 meeting. OPEC+ crude production is now set to decline for the second consecutive year in 2024, even as global demand rises. Even if cuts are successful in keeping oil prices strong, this may ultimately be counterproductive as it will encourage further growth in non-OPEC+ supply (and potentially drive additional consumers to shift to EVs). There may come a point in 2024 where at least some OPEC+ members opt for a market share strategy over price defense."", 'A new wave of consolidation in clean tech; extended wave for fossil fuels. The unwinding of two years of polysilicon supply constraints has resulted in lower solar project costs and potentially wider margins for developers. As a result of this shift, some companies mis-timed the cycle and are now holding excess inventory of modules that are being undercut by cheaper newly-manufactured ones, placing themselves at risk of acquisition. Western wind turbine manufacturers are struggling with eroded margins driven by cost inflation and an R&D race to produce larger turbines, combined with an increasing competition from Chinese vendors. Consolidation in the clean technology industry is likely to foster a manufacturing base capable of operating more comfortably with thinner margins. Fossil fuel producers are coming off a period of near record margins, and several who have banked these profits and bought back shares are leveraging their balance sheets to acquire productive assets at a lower cost than what it would take to develop them internally (i.e., ExxonMobil and Chevron acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources and Hess, respectively). Conditions remain ripe for further consolidation in fossil fuels.', 'A make-or-break year for hydrogen? Perhaps no aspect of the energy transition has received more attention than hydrogen over the past year. The US, UK, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, Australia, South Korea, and India have all announced supply-side subsidy schemes, with the EU, UK, Japan and South Korea also putting low-carbon hydrogen production targets in place. Bullish projections of future hydrogen demand have led to nearly 100 million mt of announced low-carbon hydrogen production capacity in various stages of the development pipeline. However, the industry is encountering sizeable cost increases, with required capital expenditure estimates going up by 40-50%. While some of the cost inflation may be transitory, electrolyzer projects tend to be highly complex, bespoke, and are proving far harder to construct than initially anticipated. Capacity is increasing but the market is looking for 10-15 large final investment decisions (FIDs) in 2024 to give confidence that momentum can be maintained. Also under scrutiny will be the results of European hydrogen auctions. Bids significantly below ceiling prices will be evidence of confidence in the market and a tolerance on the part of developers to accept price and development risk. Bids at or close to the ceiling will suggest the opposite and could suggest that hydrogen supply may grow more slowly than anticipated.', ""Surpluses in critical metals are coming, but 2024 may be the last year of 'low' prices. Battery metals prices surged in 2022 on rapid growth in demand for lithium, cobalt, and nickel. But demand has since moderated due to the global economic slowdown. A significant response on the supply side has already cooled prices, by as much as 50%. Lithium supply has risen more sharply in 2023, boosted by recent project startups notably in Latin America, nickel supply is surging from Indonesia and China and the flow of cobalt exports from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has also increased. However, due to continued large increases in demand for batteries and potential instability in the DRC, these surpluses will likely fade. Due to the long-lead nature of mining development, another period of tightness is expected from 2025, with copper – the key metal for electrification - expected to see prices moving sharply higher over the medium-to-long term amid the emergence of significant market deficits for both raw material (concentrate) and refined products."", 'The geopolitics of energy and climate are entering a new phase. Using energy as leverage in geopolitical affairs has a long and storied history, most recently in Russia\'s attempt to weaponize its energy supply in the invasion of Ukraine. While Europe has so far managed to balance supply and demand for oil and without too large of a disruption, the geopolitical landscape has likely been permanently altered. Without Europe as an offtaker, Russia is now extremely dependent on China, shifting the balance of power in negotiations regarding the development of the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline in Beijing\'s favor. China is also bolstering its global influence utilizing its ""Belt and Road Initiative"" to supply both domestically-produced renewables and project finance to developing countries. China is not alone in using clean energy as leverage in international trade, as potential trading partners scramble to qualify for use under the US Inflation Reduction Act. Europe is eyeing protections to its domestic industry from trade and will unveil the specifics of its carbon border adjustment mechanism in 2024 as well as add shipping into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Both measures will effectively project European carbon pricing policy across the globe, with EU ETS prices set to rise to over €90 per metric ton on average in 2024.', ""Elections are a wildcard. In 2024, 78 elections are scheduled across the world, over half of which will choose a new president. Over 2 billion people are expected to go to the polls. While perhaps not unprecedented, such a concentration of political risk into one single year is certainly historic. Attention naturally falls to the US, where any return of a Republican president to the helm of the worlds' largest economy could threaten to undo the provisions of the IRA, extract the US from participation in the Paris Agreement once again and reshape relations with trading partners. Elections to the European Parliament in June, as well as polls in individual European countries through the year will indicate whether or not the populist swing observed in some states in 2023 will be maintained. India's next general election will be held mid-year and votes will also take place in Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa. Amid the emergence of more assertive nations in the Southern Hemisphere, which are seeking to match geopolitical influence with growing economic heft, the election year of 2024 could further reorder what is already a fluid and disjointed world."", 'Dan Klein, Head of Energy Pathways, S&P Global Commodity Insights, said: ""The still young decade has seen more than its fair share of black swan events, from the COVID pandemic to wars in Ukraine and now Gaza. Even if such chaotic events fail to emerge over the next 12 months, volatility will remain high as most energy markets have not yet been able to adapt to previous swings in supply and demand fundamentals to find a new normal.""

With the brakes off the supply chain, the risk to further growth is that demand momentum fades as consumer uncertainty overtakes pent-up demand.\xa0', 'SOUTHFIELD, Mich., Dec. 14, 2023\xa0 /PRNewswire/ -- Global new light vehicle sales in 2024 will see a 2.8% increase year-over-year, according to a new forecast by S&P Global Mobility. The light vehicle output recovery continues to feed inventory restocking efforts across many regions, as supply chain and demand is further recovering, supported by lingering pent-up consumer demand. S&P Global Mobility remains wary on recovery prospects, however, with consumer demand challenged by elevated vehicle pricing alongside challenging credit and lending conditions. ', 'The forecast outlook incorporates stickier interest rates, improving supply chains, the affordability squeeze, lofty new vehicle prices, patchy consumer confidence, energy price/supply concerns, auto lending risks, and ongoing electrification growing pains. ', '""2024 is expected to be another year of cagey recovery, with the auto industry moving beyond clear supply-side risks, into a murkier macro-led demand environment,"" said Colin Couchman, executive director of global light vehicle forecasting for S&P Global Mobility. ""A major concern is how \'natural\' EV demand will fare as governments consider scaling back interventionist policy support – especially for incentives and subsidies, industrial policy, and OEM planning targets.""', 'Full-year 2023 global light vehicle sales – projected to reach nearly 86.0 million units by S&P Global Mobility – represent a 8.9% increase from 2022 levels, with new auto demand benefiting from ongoing output gains from restocking inventories as supply chains normalize.', 'Market-by-market forecasts\xa0', 'Europe:\xa0Wrapping up 2023, solid Western/Central European market momentum should deliver 14.7 million units (+12.8% y/y), as improved vehicle production levels help delivery times and inventory recovery. For 2024, S&P Global Mobility forecasts 15.1 million units, up by 2.9% y/y – reflecting economic recession risks, tighter credit conditions, easing pent-up demand, still-high car prices, and tapering EV subsidies. ', '""Key challenges for Europe include the dynamic electrification transition, alongside wait-and-see customers, lurking Chinese OEMs, energy woes, and looming EU elections,"" Couchman said.', 'United States:\xa0US sales volumes are expected to reach 15.9 million units in 2024, an estimated increase of 2.0% from the projected 2023 level of 15.5 million units.', '""Just when the auto industry is looking to return to a sense of normalcy from the supply side of the equation, US consumers in the market for new vehicle in 2024 will continue to face affordability issues by way of high interest rates, tight credit conditions and slow-to-recede new vehicle prices,"" said Chris Hopson, manager of North American light vehicle sales forecasting for S&P Global Mobility. ""An uncertain consumer translates to an expectation of a mildly progressing auto sales environment next year.""', '""With an assumption that auto production levels will continue to advance in 2024, growth of new vehicle inventory presents the opportunity for rising incentive levels and deal making – a potential release valve to the vehicle price pressures realized over the last year,"" Hopson added. ', 'With the rollout of several highly anticipated models, US BEV sales will continue to develop in the new year. \xa0By the end of 2024, there will be nearly 100 BEV models available, double the number there were in 2022, covering several more segments and providing consumers interested in an electric vehicle even more choice.', 'Mainland China:\xa0For the year ending, the CNY100 billion extension of New Energy Vehicle (NEV) incentives and recovering local vehicle production supporting domestic sales, 2023 should see a recovery to 25.3 million units (+4.9% y/y), according to S&P Global Mobility. For 2024, the market will continue to be supported by pent-up demand with gradual improvement of consumer confidence – which has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. 2024 demand is forecasted at 26.4 million units, up a further 4.2%. ', 'Mainland China NEV affordability is likely to further improve in 2024 with local battery cell prices already declining significantly through 2023. Coupled with NEV tax exemption into 2024-2025, NEV penetration (as % of passenger vehicles) is projected to further increase to 44% in 2024, from 36% in 2023.', '2024 production outlook downshifting towards traditional demand-driven model\xa0', 'On the manufacturing side, global light vehicle production in 2023 is expected to finish at 89.8 million units – a healthy 9.0% improvement over 2022 levels that exceeds expectations in several regions, further building on implied inventory restocking. This marks a welcome return to pre-pandemic levels of production on a global basis, powered by gains in mainland China and India.', 'S&P Global Mobility continues to see a general production outlook that is reliant on a more traditional demand-driven model. As we transition to 2024, with inventories reaching equilibrium in many markets, global production growth is expected to slip into a mild reverse as the industry navigates recovery after a tumultuous several years. For 2024, S&P Global Mobility forecasts light vehicle production levels to decline by 0.4%, to 89.4 million units.', '""Vehicle output levels are flirting with the top of the current cycle, with faster-than-expected inventory restocking potentially colliding with real-world consumer demand levels,"" said Mark Fulthorpe, executive director of global light vehicle forecasting for S&P Global Mobility. ""During 2023, vehicle production has benefitted from a virtuous cycle of improving supply chains and strong order backlogs. As these conditions recede, manufacturing will have less support."" ', 'In mainland China, S&P Global Mobility forecasts effectively flat production levels for 2024, down 0.1%, at 28.3 million units. With inventories largely restored to pre-crisis levels and fragile domestic demand, further export gains are expected to provide the main positive effect.', 'Europe is expected to produce 17.4 million units in 2024, off by 1.8% from an estimated 17.8 million this year. Like in mainland China, inventory levels are estimated to be restored close to pre-crisis levels and will provide little upside in an environment marked by diminishing backlogs and weaker incoming demand. Growing imports from China are also expected to be felt. ', ""For the North American region, overall production is expected to make a small gain, 0.5%, at 15.7 million units – boosted by 3.9% growth in US activity. Inventory restocking continues to provide an upside, but it is not uniform, with pockets of the Detroit-3's lineup overstocked while Japanese and Korean brands still have a pipeline to fill."", 'While supply chain conditions have undoubtedly improved since 2022, we continue to warn of a structural deficit in capacity for semiconductors, notably older mature nodes. There was theoretical overcapacity in 2023 as demand from other industries eased, but there remains a risk that constraints could resurface once demand from other sectors recovers.', '""We do not foresee chip supply problems in 2024 as allocation for automotive is robust and is bolstered by recent stockpiling of chips by the vehicle makers,"" said Jeremie Bouchaud, director, semiconductor, E/E and autonomy practice, S&P Global Mobility. ""But 2025 could be a bottleneck if non-automotive demand comes back strongly.""', 'Electrification shift looks unstoppable despite near-term uncertainty in Europe & US', 'The past few years have seen many OEMs reaffirming electrification ambitions for the coming five to 15 years. More recently the narrative has shifted, with some automakers highlighting the twin challenges of the electrification transition—scaling output of sellable BEVs and finding willing customers to buy them. ', 'Reports of the demise of electric vehicles have been greatly exaggerated, and S&P Global Mobility projects global sales for battery electric passenger vehicles to be on track to post 13.3 million units for 2024 – accounting for an estimated 16.2% of global passenger vehicle sales. For reference, 2023 posted an estimated 9.6 million BEVs, for 12% market share.', 'Major markets are forecast for the majority of this volume, though smaller markets will also see modest increases. \xa0Forecasted BEV share by region is as follows:', 'BEV Share Estimates, 2024\xa0', 'BEV Share Estimate in Region\xa0', 'YOY Change (2024 v. 2023)\xa0', 'Europe (Central/Western)\xa0', '22.2\xa0%', '+41\xa0%', 'US\xa0', '13.2\xa0%', '+66.4\xa0%', 'China\xa0', '28.6\xa0%', '+28\xa0%', 'India\xa0', '4.1\xa0%', '+39.0\xa0%', 'Global\xa0', '17.5\xa0%', '+39.5\xa0%', 'Source: S&P Global Mobility, BEV share estimates, December 2023. ©2023 S&P Global Mobility\xa0', 'Beyond 2024, many questions remain in the electrification space, especially regarding charging infrastructure, grid power, battery supply chains, global sourcing patterns, a swath of newly arriving EVs, and the appropriate level of policymaker support to help smooth the transition from fossil fuel to electric.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the strategic significance of these bases and the logistical advantage they provide to certain nations by heading over directly to the 5 Countries With The Most Overseas Military Bases.', 'Several major global powers maintain military presence and foothold in different regions of the world through their overseas bases, which help in providing them a logistical edge over their foes. These military bases are often equipped with modern weapons and military equipment and allow countries to strike enemy targets anywhere in the world.', 'The United States, for instance, has more than 750 military bases across 80 countries, and has deployed nearly 175,000 soldiers in 159 countries of the world, which provides them a key edge over foes and the capability to remain within striking distance if a conflict was to break out. These military bases are a key factor that contribute to America’s global hegemony and enable Washington to counter threats emanating from countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.', 'While an exact count is not known, the Americans operate numerous military bases in the Middle East that deploy more than 30,000 troops. The Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, located west of Doha, is the largest US military installation in the region, and has been critical for American operations in the Middle East, and previously Afghanistan. The base houses nearly a third of all American troops stationed in the Middle East, and is equipped with modern weapons and fighter jets. In 2020, the US Air Force deployed five F-22 fighters developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to the Al-Udeid Air Base.', 'The base is also used by the US to help the host country and strategic ally, Qatar, in bolstering its defense. A $78 million contract was awarded to RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) in 2020 to upgrade Qatar’s Air Operations Center. During the same year, a $657 million deal was signed by the US with The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) to provide logistics and sparing support to Qatar’s F-15 fighter jets. The execution of work of both contracts are being carried out at this airbase.', 'The Americans also maintain a significant military presence in East Asia. US troops have been stationed in Japan since the end of World War II in 1945, and have been in South Korea since the Korean War in 1950. These two countries alone host more than half of all American soldiers stationed overseas. Camp Humphreys near Seoul is the largest overseas military base of the United States. The base is equipped with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s THAAD anti-ballistic missile defense system to protect South Korea from regular missile threats issued by North Korea. This month at Camp Humphreys, Seoul successfully test-fired RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s ship-to-air missile for the first time on its territory, as part of a symbolic show of strength to Pyongyang.\xa0', ""Europe hosts eight US Army Garrisons where more than 60,000 American troops are deployed. The Ramstein Air Base in Germany is the most notable overseas military base operated by Washington, and is critical to the US Air Force’s European operations. In 2021, the US Air Force deployed The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s E-8C JSTARS to the base to take part in trainings with other Europe-based units. Last year, NATO announced that America was sending a fleet of its F-35 fighter jets as well to the Ramstein Air Base to support NATO's Air Policing operations over member nations."", 'Russia’s military ambitions over the last decade have ensured that the country still wants to compete with the United States and play a global role. Moscow has actively worked to further enhance its influence in former Soviet territories, and has been on the lookout for openings in Asia and Africa to increase its military potential.\xa0', 'Russia already operates numerous bases in Central and West Asia, and is now looking to make inroads in Africa, a region where it is among the top arms suppliers. This year Moscow and Khartoum reached an agreement to establish a logistic center for the Russian Navy in Sudan. This has been followed by the Central African Republic (CAR) expressing interest in having the Russians build a military base on its territory that is large enough to host 10,000-15,000 soldiers.', 'Joseph M. Arseneau/Shutterstock.com', 'Countries with the most overseas military bases are listed in ascending order of the number of their foreign military installations. Since most countries do not make complete or any information public related to their military bases, we have sourced data from numerous independent and credible news agencies and publications, including Brookings, Small Wars Journal, BBC, and local media groups in countries these installations are located in. In the case where countries had the same number of overseas military bases, we outranked one over the other on the basis of their strategic importance.', 'If interested, you can also take a look at the 15 Most Important U.S. Military Bases in the World.', 'Let’s now head over the list of countries that have the most overseas military bases.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 1', 'Japan has a military base in Djibouti. The need for the installation developed after a spike in pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden, which faces the Bab el-Mandeb Strait through which much of the world’s oil flows. Following 2008, the UN General Assembly passed multiple resolutions for member states to work together on deterring piracy, after which a number of countries, including Japan, established military bases in the region. The base proved critical for the evacuation of Japanese nationals from Israel following Hamas’ attack this October. SDF’s three KC-767 planes built by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) flew to Djibouti to take part in the airlifting operation.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 1', 'Djibouti also hosts Italy’s only military bases outside its national borders. It houses approximately 300 Italian military personnel, including special forces and navy riflemen to protect merchant ships in the Indian Ocean. According to Small Wars Journal, Italian soldiers deployed in Djibouti also take part in anti-terrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 1', 'According to a 2012 report by Stratfor Global Intelligence, an American strategic consultancy firm, Israel maintains a military base in Eritrea to monitor Iran’s activities in the region and intelligence gathering in the Red Sea. The base is located in the Dahlak archipelago of Eritrea.\xa0', 'Overseas Military Bases: 1', 'China currently has only one overseas military base, located on the coast of the Horn of Africa in Djibouti. The base is located within a few miles of America’s Camp Lemonnier, and provides China access to the Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport. According to defense analysts, Beijing plans on expanding its military presence in Asia and Africa over the next five to ten years. Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota in Sri Lanka, and Equatorial Guinea’s Bata are likely locations for China’s next naval bases.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 2', 'The Al Minhad Air Base located 15 miles south of Dubai, UAE, serves as the headquarters for the Joint Task Force 633 of Australia’s Defense Forces, and helps support Australia’s operations in the Middle East. The country’s other overseas military base is in Penang, Malaysia, called the RMAF Butterworth Air Base. While it is actively used by the Malaysian Air Force, the command authority rests with an Australian air-vice marshal under the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA). Australia deployed its 75 Squadron of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35A Lightning II aircrafts to Butterworth last year.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 3', 'The United Arab Emirates operates three overseas military bases in Libya, Somaliland, and Yemen. While Somaliland’s MPs allowed the UAE to set up a military base in the port of Berbera, its bases in the other two regions have not been short of controversy and have received criticism from the central governments of these countries. Since 2018, the Yemeni island of Socotra has been under the de facto control of the UAE under the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, a participant of the civil war in Yemen. The Emiratis operate a military base in Socotra, with hundreds of troops stationed there. UAE also maintains a remote airbase in conflict-ridden Libya, near the airport in Marj.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 3', 'India has been expanding its sphere of influence in the region in a bid to counter China’s presence in the Indian Ocean. According to Indian media group, WION, the country’s navy has built a support base in Oman’s Duqm Port for repair and maintenance of Indian ships. In October this year, India’s newly constructed military base in Mauritius, which includes an airstrip, was declared ready for deployment. The country also maintains a military presence in Central Asia, where it has been operating the Ayni airbase in Dushanbe for the last two decades along with host-nation Tajikistan.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 3', 'According to the Center for Applied Turkey Studies (CATS), Ankara operates three overseas military bases. Its first foreign installation was established in 1974 in Northern Cyprus, and houses between 30-40 thousand Turkish troops. Türkiye considers this base essential for securing the ""Anatolian Homeland"".

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Should You Invest in PHM?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $11.49.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup.

So, of course, Moderna out with this update on its cancer vaccine that it is testing in tandem with Merck's Keytruda, that blockbuster cancer drug. And what they found is that the drug in tandem with the vaccine can reduce the risk of recurrence of melanoma-- late stage melanoma-- by up to 49% after three years. That's a really huge number in terms of the protection that it can give patients."", ""So that's where the jump is coming from today. Moderna finally getting a little bit of positive news for its stock.

We're going to work really hard to see how we can accelerate the launch in some countries, potentially as early as '25."", ""And then it's not only melanoma. We announced on Monday starting of phase three in lung. And we're going to have more phase three starting in 2024.

As you know, RSV is the third respiratory virus after COVID and flu that kills people in the US every year. And so this new vaccine that have been launched by two of our pharma company in the fall. It's the first time there's been a RSV vaccine."", ""But what is exciting about our product is it's going to be the most convenient product for pharmacists and for doctors because it will be in a prefilled syringe. The current vaccine on the market are pretty cumbersome to prepare. Every time you have a new patient who wants a vaccine, the doctor or the pharmacist have to do with one vaccine nine steps of preparation. With [INAUDIBLE] vaccine, four steps of preparation. With Moderna, basically prefilled syringe. You just inject it. And you're done."", ""And so if you think about the pharmacy retail chain, the independent pharmacist and the doctors and nurses, they are so busy. As you know, there's a lack of health care worker, given the aging of a population. And so we think we want to be part of a solution. And so we think we'll have a big launch. I'm actually very engaged with a team on preparing the launch. And I'm very excited for that new product. That will be the second product, which also will mean and will be the proof that we have a platform."", ""We've been saying for many years, even before COVID, that mRNA is enabling us to build a platform. The pharma and biotech industry have built what I call analog drugs, where every drug is different, where you have to reinvent the drug in the labs, clinical studies, and manufacturing. But with mRNA, we're able to go very fast. And we're able to get very high efficacy. So that's going to be a big game changer for medicine and patients.""]"

One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', 'During three years of share price growth, Mosaic moved from a loss to profitability. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.', 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', ""We know that Mosaic has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on Mosaic's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", 'As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Mosaic, it has a TSR of 68% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""While the broader market gained around 23% in the last year, Mosaic shareholders lost 16% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 7%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Mosaic better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Mosaic is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable..."", 'But note: Mosaic may not be the best stock to buy.

Nicholas Gangestad, the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Rockwell Automation, sold 1,004 shares of the company on December 11, 2023. This transaction has caught the attention of investors and market analysts, as insider activity can often provide valuable insights into a company's financial health and future prospects."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with ROK.', ""Nicholas Gangestad has served as the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Rockwell Automation Inc. With a strong background in finance and strategic planning, Gangestad has been instrumental in steering the company's financial operations and contributing to its growth trajectory. His role involves overseeing the company's financial strategies, including investments, capital structure, and risk management, making his insider transactions particularly noteworthy for investors."", ""Rockwell Automation Inc is a global leader in industrial automation and digital transformation solutions. The company's offerings include control systems, software, and services that cater to a wide range of industries, from automotive to pharmaceuticals. Rockwell Automation's commitment to innovation and sustainability has positioned it as a key player in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, helping businesses optimize their operations and embrace the future of smart manufacturing."", ""Insider transactions, particularly sells, can be interpreted in various ways. While some may view insider selling as a lack of confidence in the company's future performance, it is also common for executives to sell shares for personal financial planning or diversification purposes. In the case of Nicholas Gangestad, the insider has sold 2,979 shares over the past year without any recorded purchases. This pattern of selling could suggest that the insider is adjusting his personal investment portfolio rather than reflecting a negative outlook on the company's future."", ""It is also important to consider the broader context of insider activity at Rockwell Automation Inc. Over the past year, there have been no insider buys but 43 insider sells. This trend might raise questions among investors about the insiders' collective sentiment towards the company's valuation and growth prospects."", ""On the day of Gangestad's recent sell, shares of Rockwell Automation were trading at $279.43, giving the company a market cap of $33.37 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 24.33 is slightly higher than the industry median of 22.385, indicating that the stock may be priced more richly than some of its peers. However, this higher valuation could also reflect the market's confidence in Rockwell Automation's leadership position and its potential for future growth."", ""When examining the relationship between insider selling and stock price, it's crucial to consider the company's valuation metrics. With a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.81, Rockwell Automation Inc is considered modestly undervalued based on its GF Value. This suggests that despite the insider selling, the stock may still have room for appreciation, according to the intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus."", ""The GF Value is determined by historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance, and future business performance estimates from analysts. This comprehensive approach to valuation provides a more nuanced perspective on the stock's potential, beyond the immediate implications of insider transactions."", 'The insider trend image above illustrates the recent selling activity by insiders at Rockwell Automation Inc. This visual representation can help investors discern patterns and frequencies of insider transactions, which may influence investment decisions.', ""The GF Value image provides a graphical view of Rockwell Automation Inc's stock price in relation to its estimated intrinsic value. This comparison can be a useful tool for investors considering whether the current stock price offers a buying opportunity or if caution is warranted due to potential overvaluation."", ""While insider sells, such as the recent transaction by Nicholas Gangestad, can prompt investor scrutiny, it is essential to analyze these actions within the broader context of the company's financial health and market valuation. Rockwell Automation Inc's position as a modestly undervalued company, according to GuruFocus's GF Value, suggests that the stock may still be attractive to investors despite the insider selling trend. As always, investors should conduct their due diligence and consider multiple factors, including insider activity, valuation metrics, and the company's strategic outlook, before making investment decisions."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the strategic significance of these bases and the logistical advantage they provide to certain nations by heading over directly to the 5 Countries With The Most Overseas Military Bases.', 'Several major global powers maintain military presence and foothold in different regions of the world through their overseas bases, which help in providing them a logistical edge over their foes. These military bases are often equipped with modern weapons and military equipment and allow countries to strike enemy targets anywhere in the world.', 'The United States, for instance, has more than 750 military bases across 80 countries, and has deployed nearly 175,000 soldiers in 159 countries of the world, which provides them a key edge over foes and the capability to remain within striking distance if a conflict was to break out. These military bases are a key factor that contribute to America’s global hegemony and enable Washington to counter threats emanating from countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.', 'While an exact count is not known, the Americans operate numerous military bases in the Middle East that deploy more than 30,000 troops. The Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, located west of Doha, is the largest US military installation in the region, and has been critical for American operations in the Middle East, and previously Afghanistan. The base houses nearly a third of all American troops stationed in the Middle East, and is equipped with modern weapons and fighter jets. In 2020, the US Air Force deployed five F-22 fighters developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to the Al-Udeid Air Base.', 'The base is also used by the US to help the host country and strategic ally, Qatar, in bolstering its defense. A $78 million contract was awarded to RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) in 2020 to upgrade Qatar’s Air Operations Center. During the same year, a $657 million deal was signed by the US with The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) to provide logistics and sparing support to Qatar’s F-15 fighter jets. The execution of work of both contracts are being carried out at this airbase.', 'The Americans also maintain a significant military presence in East Asia. US troops have been stationed in Japan since the end of World War II in 1945, and have been in South Korea since the Korean War in 1950. These two countries alone host more than half of all American soldiers stationed overseas. Camp Humphreys near Seoul is the largest overseas military base of the United States. The base is equipped with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s THAAD anti-ballistic missile defense system to protect South Korea from regular missile threats issued by North Korea. This month at Camp Humphreys, Seoul successfully test-fired RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s ship-to-air missile for the first time on its territory, as part of a symbolic show of strength to Pyongyang.\xa0', ""Europe hosts eight US Army Garrisons where more than 60,000 American troops are deployed. The Ramstein Air Base in Germany is the most notable overseas military base operated by Washington, and is critical to the US Air Force’s European operations. In 2021, the US Air Force deployed The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s E-8C JSTARS to the base to take part in trainings with other Europe-based units. Last year, NATO announced that America was sending a fleet of its F-35 fighter jets as well to the Ramstein Air Base to support NATO's Air Policing operations over member nations."", 'Russia’s military ambitions over the last decade have ensured that the country still wants to compete with the United States and play a global role. Moscow has actively worked to further enhance its influence in former Soviet territories, and has been on the lookout for openings in Asia and Africa to increase its military potential.\xa0', 'Russia already operates numerous bases in Central and West Asia, and is now looking to make inroads in Africa, a region where it is among the top arms suppliers. This year Moscow and Khartoum reached an agreement to establish a logistic center for the Russian Navy in Sudan.

The need for the installation developed after a spike in pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden, which faces the Bab el-Mandeb Strait through which much of the world’s oil flows. Following 2008, the UN General Assembly passed multiple resolutions for member states to work together on deterring piracy, after which a number of countries, including Japan, established military bases in the region. The base proved critical for the evacuation of Japanese nationals from Israel following Hamas’ attack this October. SDF’s three KC-767 planes built by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) flew to Djibouti to take part in the airlifting operation.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 1', 'Djibouti also hosts Italy’s only military bases outside its national borders. It houses approximately 300 Italian military personnel, including special forces and navy riflemen to protect merchant ships in the Indian Ocean. According to Small Wars Journal, Italian soldiers deployed in Djibouti also take part in anti-terrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 1', 'According to a 2012 report by Stratfor Global Intelligence, an American strategic consultancy firm, Israel maintains a military base in Eritrea to monitor Iran’s activities in the region and intelligence gathering in the Red Sea. The base is located in the Dahlak archipelago of Eritrea.\xa0', 'Overseas Military Bases: 1', 'China currently has only one overseas military base, located on the coast of the Horn of Africa in Djibouti. The base is located within a few miles of America’s Camp Lemonnier, and provides China access to the Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport. According to defense analysts, Beijing plans on expanding its military presence in Asia and Africa over the next five to ten years. Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota in Sri Lanka, and Equatorial Guinea’s Bata are likely locations for China’s next naval bases.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 2', 'The Al Minhad Air Base located 15 miles south of Dubai, UAE, serves as the headquarters for the Joint Task Force 633 of Australia’s Defense Forces, and helps support Australia’s operations in the Middle East. The country’s other overseas military base is in Penang, Malaysia, called the RMAF Butterworth Air Base. While it is actively used by the Malaysian Air Force, the command authority rests with an Australian air-vice marshal under the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA). Australia deployed its 75 Squadron of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35A Lightning II aircrafts to Butterworth last year.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 3', 'The United Arab Emirates operates three overseas military bases in Libya, Somaliland, and Yemen. While Somaliland’s MPs allowed the UAE to set up a military base in the port of Berbera, its bases in the other two regions have not been short of controversy and have received criticism from the central governments of these countries. Since 2018, the Yemeni island of Socotra has been under the de facto control of the UAE under the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, a participant of the civil war in Yemen. The Emiratis operate a military base in Socotra, with hundreds of troops stationed there. UAE also maintains a remote airbase in conflict-ridden Libya, near the airport in Marj.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 3', 'India has been expanding its sphere of influence in the region in a bid to counter China’s presence in the Indian Ocean. According to Indian media group, WION, the country’s navy has built a support base in Oman’s Duqm Port for repair and maintenance of Indian ships. In October this year, India’s newly constructed military base in Mauritius, which includes an airstrip, was declared ready for deployment. The country also maintains a military presence in Central Asia, where it has been operating the Ayni airbase in Dushanbe for the last two decades along with host-nation Tajikistan.', 'Overseas Military Bases: 3', 'According to the Center for Applied Turkey Studies (CATS), Ankara operates three overseas military bases. Its first foreign installation was established in 1974 in Northern Cyprus, and houses between 30-40 thousand Turkish troops. Türkiye considers this base essential for securing the ""Anatolian Homeland"". In 2015, the country set up its first military base in the Middle East in Qatar to enhance the host country’s defense capabilities. Türkiye\'s first base in Africa became operational in Mogadishu, Somalia in 2017, and aims at capacity-building of the Somali armed forces.

In a major shift, the central bank signaled three rate cuts for the next year, with the federal funds rate falling to a range of 4.4-4.9%, down from the current 5.25% to 5.50%. This suggests that the Fed will cut rates by a total of 0.75% next year, indicating that the historic rate-hiking campaign might be ending. It had previously forecast two rate cuts for 2024. Following the meeting, markets are pricing in a nearly 60% chance that the Fed will begin to cut rates at its March meeting, up from 40% the day prior, per the data from the CME Group.Being cyclical in nature, the blue-chip index outperforms when economic growth improves.

If you want to read about some more Fortune 500 stocks, go directly to 5 Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now.', 'The post-pandemic economic boom was somewhat overshadowed by supply chain issues, inflation, and geopolitical tensions in the past two years. A fiscal tightening by the Federal Reserve to tackle soaring prices also led to recession fears. The United States economy, however, weathered these storms to emerge stronger than ever. Analysts are now predicting a major boom for stocks. Ed Yardeni, a prominent financial analyst and founder of Yardeni Research, has forecast that the benchmark S&P 500 will jump 30% to 6,000 by 2025.\xa0', 'Tech firms will remain a key driver of this growth, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), all of which feature in the Fortune 500, an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks 500 of the largest United States corporations by total revenue, expected to benefit from the economic boom. The stocks of these three companies are up by 58%, 56%, and 50% this year. After a 12% plunge in 2022, the benchmark S&P 500 is likely to end 2023 with 14% in gains.\xa0', 'This optimism is riding on recent statements from the Federal Reserve that indicate that rate cuts will begin next year. On December 14, Fed chief Jerome Powell said that the Fed was done raising rates as inflation cooled. Stocks rallied and bond yield shrunk after that statement, with analysts jacking up their price forecasts for the coming months. The Fed is expected to make three quarter point cuts to the benchmark interest rates next year. These rates had been at their highest level since 2001 after record inflation in 2022.\xa0', 'Not everybody is convinced about the emerging trends. In late November, prominent investment firm JPMorgan released a gloomy forecast for 2024. In a transition year for the economy, the investment bank predicted that the benchmark S&P 500 would drop to around 4,200 by the end of 2024. The bank identified shrinking global growth and household savings, rising geopolitical risks, and elections in the United States that could add to policy volatility as some of the prime reasons behind this pessimistic forecast.\xa0', 'The position of JPMorgan stands in contrast to others on Wall Street. In addition to Yardeni, famous firms like Bank of America and Deutsche Bank have also backed the S&P 500 to touch record highs next year. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also constructive on the index, with David Kostin at the former and Mike Wilson at the latter both predicting that the index will come close to the previous peak in the next few months. The average analyst estimate for the index for 2024 sits at around 4,664, per Bloomberg.\xa0', 'Investors eager to get on top of these growth trends should have a listen to recent remarks by Sundar Pichai, the CEO of tech firm Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), said during the third quarter earnings call that his firm was pleased with the growth in search, short videos, and cloud services. Pichai highlighted the market opportunity offered by the rapid evolution of products and services in the artificial intelligence domain and urged investors to focus on strides being made in countries like India and Japan. He also touched on the importance of cloud services.', '""We see continued growth, with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%. Today, more than 60% of the world’s thousand-largest companies are Google Cloud customers. At Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of Infrastructure, Data and AI, Workspace Collaboration, and Cybersecurity solutions.

(NYSE:UPS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:', '“A higher-for-longer rate mentality taking hold was a headwind for economically sensitive stocks. Rising wages have been one of the main drivers of inflation, and this has proved to be a sticky area, keeping the Fed’s attention and weighing on share prices. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes. While the new union deal will dampen profits over the next 12 months due to the front-end-loaded nature of the new five-year contract, management gained increased flexibility to deploy automation, which we think should further enhance UPS’s strong competitive position and provide a long-term tailwind to profitability.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52 \xa0', 'AT&T Inc.

Here is what the fund said:', '“Our largest new position was CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS). We owned CVS in 2021 through call options, which provided a handsome return. We sold it when it reached our assessment of intrinsic value. In the first half of the year, the stock traded down nearly 40% from its highs. CVS is valued like a pharmacy business in secular decline, while its strategy and assets are far better. CVS owns a healthcare benefits business (Aetna) and a pharmacy-benefits manager (Caremark). It recently acquired Signify Health and Oak Street Health, entering the In-Home Evaluations and primary care spaces enhancing the company’s ability to offer comprehensive healthcare services as we transition to a system more focused on value-based care. Short-term headwinds, such as an unwind from COVID, some unfavorable health care developments and negative headlines from PBM contract losses, weighed on the price. The company is again significantly undervalued, with a trough-level 8.2x P/E multiple well below peers’ 12.2x, with a 3.5% dividend yield. We saw an opportunity to diversify the portfolio with a stable company with a promising strategy and group of assets at an attractive price.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65', 'Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. On November 30, DA Davidson analyst Michael Baker maintained a Neutral rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock with a price target of $570, noting the firm has been an outperformer in the retail space.\xa0', 'Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) with 2.7 million shares worth more than $1.5 billion.\xa0', 'In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Cooper Investors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) was one of them.

The spotlight was on more highly valued stocks that represent some of our longest held positions and among the better performers over the years. The outcome is that we have exited several long-term positions at what we consider attractive prices, where the balance of Risk Adjusted Value Latency was no longer in our favour.', 'We remain admirers of these businesses and they remain on our watchlist, but the reality is their appeal is widely recognised today.

The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth. For value-conscious investors like us, investing in healthcare requires looking beyond the obvious to identify businesses that have exposure to this growth industry but which trade at low prices. Furthermore, recognizing that the constantly rising cost of healthcare cannot go on forever, we have been particularly drawn to companies whose products or services play some role in managing or reducing the cost of care.

Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

It is still likely to shake these lenders for some time to come.', 'When US regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic between March and May, the fear was that panic would spread through the US banking system and take down other mid-sized institutions.', 'That hasn’t happened thus far. Only two more banks went down in 2023, and they were both tiny rural lenders in Kansas and Iowa, while deposit outflows and stock-price volatility stabilized for other institutions that had been under intense investor scrutiny.', 'Experts began arguing that the turmoil wasn’t a ""crisis."" Perhaps a ""mini-crisis"" at best. Just this week, two indexes that track the performance of regional banks returned to levels last reached before the fall of Silicon Valley Bank as investors cheered Federal Reserve predictions of three interest rate cuts in 2024.', 'But 2023 was still a seismic year for the industry. Not only did it produce the largest annual bank seizures as measured by assets ($550 billion), but it reshaped the industry — and will likely do so for years to come. That’s why the ruckus made it on the list of Yahoo Finance’s biggest stories of the year.', 'Perhaps one lasting lesson for regional banks that were caught flat-footed in 2023 is how quickly assumptions about US banking can get flipped upside down.', 'Before the turmoil, deposits were considered super-sticky funding sources since most customers were historically slow to move their money. Treasury bonds were also considered a super-safe place for banks to invest those funds.', 'Those assumptions were upended once the Fed embarked upon its most aggressive rate-raising campaign since the 1980s.', 'Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards', 'Depositors began looking for higher yields elsewhere, starting a slow drain of deposits that would turn into a flood. The bonds that banks had purchased when deposits were flush also began to lose value, creating hundreds of billions in unrealized losses hiding in plain sight on balance sheets.', 'This all came to a head in early March when Silicon Valley Bank sold some of these bonds that had lost value, took a loss, and tried to raise new capital. The news spooked depositors, who through online accounts and mobile phones withdrew an eye-popping $42 billion in just one day.', 'Customers began to do the same at other banks, challenging the assumption that deposits would always be a stable, sticky form of funding. Within the next month, another $390 billion in deposits left US banks, on top of $600 billion already drained from the banking system before March.', 'Regulators helped stabilize things by guaranteeing to cover uninsured deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank while finding a buyer (JPMorgan Chase) willing to assume deposits and assets from First Republic.', 'But that didn’t alter a fundamental shift in the business model for many regional banks.', 'They began paying a lot more for deposits so they could keep their funding intact, a change that cut into their profits. These mid-sized banks rely heavily on the spread they earn between loans and deposits, while bigger national institutions like JPMorgan and Bank of America can lean on other revenue sources.', '""The 2023 situation was another manifestation, another endorsement of the big-bank business model, and really, it\'s sort of damning for the regional banks with a niche business model,"" Steven Kelly, associate director of research at the Yale Program for Financial Stability, told Yahoo Finance.', 'Some, as a result, are already shedding assets and certain businesses. Others are expected to merge so they can better compete with larger rivals.', 'Margins for regional banks are expected to continue dropping in 2024 since rates will remain elevated even if the Fed starts cutting.', '""I think you’ll continue to see deposit costs go up for two to three quarters"" after the Fed declares that it is done raising rates, Harris Simmons, the CEO of regional lender Zions (ZION), said last week at a conference in New York City.', 'Some mid-sized banks also face the prospect of higher capital requirements imposed by regulators, which will also act as a damper on profits.', 'And if the US economy enters a recession, which some still think is possible, that presents other problems for these banks if borrowers run into more trouble and can’t pay back their loans.', '""The part of the cycle that we\'re not through yet is a slowing economy,"" said Wedbush bank analyst David Chiaverini, who anticipates a mild recession in 2024.', 'A specific worry is that commercial real estate could start producing major losses for regional banks, which are big financiers to office buildings across the US that emptied out during the pandemic and have not yet recovered pre-pandemic occupancy rates.', '""It is going to take some time for regional banks to repair their balance sheets,"" said Apollo\'s chief economist Torsten Slok in a recent note (Disclosure: Apollo is the parent company of Yahoo Inc.).', 'Read Yahoo Finance’s countdown of the biggest stories of 2023:', ""How Sam Bankman-Fried's 2023 meltdown put the crypto world on trial"", ""X's wild, messy 2023 — and what's next"", 'AI: A crazy year in review', 'David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.', 'Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.', 'Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance']"

What's driving that move?"", ""GERARD CASSIDY: It's a good observation, because from the October lows, the banks are really outperforming the market. Year-to-date, of course, as you've just shown on your screen, there have underperforming-- they have underperformed the market. But since October, they've really outperformed the market, and it's been driven by a couple of factors."", ""First and foremost, I think what the market is deciphering is that the Federal Reserve, you know, obviously, they came out yesterday and pointed this out-- excuse me. But the Federal Reserve looks like they're at their terminal rate for Fed funds. And that, in the last four tightening cycles, has been the catalyst to get bank stocks to move higher. Second, there's an increasing possibility or probability we're going to have a soft landing in the economy. And if we do do that with the terminal rate for Fed funds, this is shaping up to look like 1995 when the stocks are up 55% that year."", ""So those are the two main factors. But also, the long end of the curve, the 10-year government Treasury, in October, was up against 5%. There was talk of maybe 6% in the 10-year. And today it broke 4% on the downside. That's been another factor for that move as well."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Gerard, when you look at rates, though, is that on balance, a headwind or a tailwind, rates coming down, that is?', ""GERARD CASSIDY: I would say it's a tailwind, because, if rates come down, the economy is going to be stronger. And we always have to remember in bank stock investing, credit trumps interest rates. And so if rates were to come down and refinancing activity picks up at the long end of the curve, if the Fed-- we don't want the Fed cutting too aggressively, because that would suggest maybe the economy is weaker than expected."", ""But if you get one or two Fed fund rate cuts in 2024, the yield curve starts to come down a bit, that's very positive for the banks, because the credit picture really improves. And when you talk to investors today, many long lonelies, their number one concern about owning a bank stock going into '24 is the fear of credit problems. And if you start taking that off the table, the stocks are going to work better. So lower rates would be positive in our view because it suggests credit won't be that material of a problem.""]"

Abbott sells one the of the leading continuous glucose monitors, the FreeStyle Libre, which reported a sales increase of 30% in the recent quarter.', ""You'll like Abbott for its solid earnings track record, its four strong businesses -- and one other thing -- its dividend. Abbott is a Dividend King, meaning it's increased payments for more than 50 straight years, so you can count on this company for passive income growth."", 'Trading at 24x forward earnings estimates, this stock is a must-buy right now.', ""Moderna took center stage as it brought its coronavirus vaccine from the drawing board to market in less than a year -- and the vaccine generated billions of dollars in earnings as the biotech's first and only product. Those earnings helped Moderna build up cash and fund other programs in the pipeline."", ""Today, even though vaccine demand is on the decline, Moderna's future looks bright. First, vaccine demand isn't what it was at the height of the pandemic but isn't disappearing. Seasonal vaccination should represent significant recurring revenue for Moderna. And the company is developing a combined COVID/flu candidate that may become a popular product as it could interest the population that generally goes for an annual flu shot."", 'Second, Moderna may not be a single-product company for long. The biotech says it aims to launch 15 new products within the coming five years. Even if it only wins approval for a few, it still could deliver impressive growth.', ""That's why, trading at 8.5x forward earnings estimates, Moderna looks like a bargain you don't want to miss."", ""Like Moderna, Pfizer sells one of the leading coronavirus vaccines -- and Pfizer sells a billion-dollar coronavirus treatment, Paxlovid. Also, like Moderna, Pfizer faces declines in sales of these products. On top of that, some of Pfizer's other blockbusters outside of the coronavirus program are facing patent expirations later this decade -- and this should lead to a drop in sales."", ""Why should you buy this stock? Because Pfizer is prepared to compensate for those losses -- and go on to grow over the long term, thanks to new products. The company aims to launch 19 new products or indications during an 18-month period, and has already released 13. So it's well on its way to meeting the goal."", 'Pfizer also pays a dividend, with a yield that beats that of the S&P 500, and has put the focus on dividend growth.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) is a company most people have heard of. It was spun off from eBay Inc. (EBAY) in 2015, and while the stock price surged 790% until July 2021, it is now down 80% from its all-time high. There are some significant reasons for this that I will address, but I am also confident the stock is currently one of the largest value opportunities on the market right now.', 'The GF Score currently ranks the company at 97 out of 100, which is nothing short of exceptional. However, I am also interested in picking apart some of the hidden discrepancies in the stock, looking into the operational details to find potentially overlooked defects and competitive struggles that could be coming.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PYPL.', ""One of the major factors contributing to the company's share price decline is eBay's transition to its own payment system in June 2021. This significantly reduced how many people on eBay paid using PayPal. In 2021, Benzinga reported PayPal's revenue coming from eBay was just 4% due to this, after dropping 45% in a quarter. However, PayPal's payment volume went from $1.25 trillion in 2021 to $1.36 trillion in 2022, showing continued resilience and growth in the face of eBay's transition."", ""CNBC's Juhohn Lee observed the online payment provider thrived during the pandemic. He noted the company's revenue increased from $17.8 billion in 2019 to over $25 billion in 2021. At one point during the pandemic, e-commerce sales contributed 16.4% of all retail sales in the U.S., but it has been under 15% for the past two years. As life returned to normal, the stock began to crash."", ""Additionally, greater competition from the likes of Block (NYSE:SQ), Stripe, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Pay have thwarted areas that PayPal used to dominate. It is challenging to precisely ascertain PayPal's market share, especially in an ever-evolving industry focused on multiple revenue sources that I do not think accurately fall under one umbrella: the payment management market. Yet according to 6Sense, PayPal has the greatest share of this market with 40.43% as compared to Stripe's 36.99%."", ""However, Apple Pay, for example, does not appear in its peer comparison group despite Apple Insider reporting a transaction volume of $6 trillion annually for the service. PayPal's annual transaction volume in 2023 is approximately $1.49 trillion, calculated using real first-, second-, and third-quarter 2023 data. To do this, I sourced transaction volume data of $355 billion from the first quarter, $377 billion from the second quarter and $388 billion from third quarter, took an average and multiplied it by four as fourth-quarter earnings have yet to be reported. These foundational figures were sourced from Insider Intelligence, DemandSage and GuruFocus. As such, Apple Pay clearly dominates PayPal in this regard."", 'Moving forward, PayPal will struggle to remain resilient against such intense competition. As newer technologies take over, it is difficult for some older companies to stay current. This could be a slower growth chapter for PayPal, yet the investment still looks compelling.', 'Of the most effective operational strategies PayPal is employing, its Buy Now, Pay Later initiative that it launched in August 2020, are the most convincing to me. The only issue is Apple Pay and Stripe also now have such services. Apple started rolling out its own Apple Pay Later in spring 2023. Stripe partners with third-party BNPL providers, including Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM), Klarna and Afterpay.', ""One of the reasons I think PayPal will struggle to keep up is the power-dominant hardware providers now have to control consumers' tastes based on ease. For example, Apple Pay has such a straightforward application on people's phones that it almost seems silly to pull out PayPal in most in-person transactions. I have found PayPal most useful in online money transfers; perhaps this is a core area it could harness to remain competitive and corner a part of the payments business moving forward."", ""Let's look at how PayPal plans to harness artificial intelligence. It seems like every technology company in the world right now is planning on becoming AI integrated. I think there is a good reason for this; the companies that do not will get left behind and will not be able to keep up with the efficient and more attractive products of AI-integrated companies. PayPal is already using AI for fraud detection and payment processing, data management and improvements, enhanced security and, most interesting to me, machine learning models to improve authorization rates of valid transactions."", 'From my research, there are three core areas where PayPal will compete in the payments industry on AI integrations. These are:', 'Fraud detection harnessing AI to analyze datasets and detect fraudulent activities in real time.', 'Regulatory compliance using AI to review customer data and monitor transactions, ensuring compliance with financial regulations.', 'Customer service AI assistants processing payments and responding to queries, allowing humans to focus on more sophisticated tasks.', 'While the risks I have presented thus far are related to future operations and not immediate revenue growth concerns, it is worth considering how this could play out to get a deeper perspective on future earnings.', 'GuruFocus currently gives the company a growth rank of 10 out of 10. Evidence shows that a high score is warranted, including a 17.90% 10-year average annual revenue growth rate and a one-year growth rate of 12%. On an even stronger note, the earnings per share without non-recurring items 10-year average annual revenue growth rate was 15.5% and, on a one-year basis, it is a massive 47.10%.', ""While this shows continued resilience in the face of some of the operational challenges I have highlighted, I am not sure the company can sustain such intense growth forever. While removing PayPal's direct partnership with eBay was a big blow to the company, its strategies to remain relevant are working. Yet, could this be an era of slow growth for PayPal? Or will it miraculously innovate to become a cutting-edge, future-oriented and AI-focused electronic payment provider? Perhaps, but let's look at the evidence for this."", 'The company is rigorously entering the world of cryptocurrency, introducing measures like Checkout with Crypto, allowing users to buy and sell crypto through their PayPal account, and integrating crypto utilities into Venmo, a mobile payment service owned by the company. This strategy is smart, and one of the ways it could remain one of the most crucial payment services in the world is by fulfilling a more extensive, more fully integrated payment system that accommodates all types of currencies and easy exchanges.', ""However, it is worth noting that just in the last few days, it has been widely reported that Amazon (AMZN) will no longer accept Venmo as of Jan. 10, 2024. This will significantly affect Venmo's revenue and transaction volume and hurt PayPal's stock."", 'Yet the most significant risk to PayPal remains the heightened competition. Becoming the ""everything to do with money app"" is not a small task, and multiple prominent players, including Elon Musk, who started at PayPal as one of the founders, want to achieve this. As such, I am pondering which company\'s leadership has the direction and resolve to make it happen. Arguably, with the old guard of PayPal moving on to their own respective platforms and enterprises, the innovation needed to pull this off could be gone.', ""However, I do not think that is the case. Instead, I believe the company has to rigorously face its competitors and innovate quickly toward an evolved goal to remain relevant. If it does that, it could avoid a worst-case scenario of being phased out in the decades to come as an initial e-payment provider that more revolutionary enterprises have since dominated. I believe this will be the defining factor contributing to a decline or continued growth in PayPal's future revenue and earnings."", 'To reiterate, PayPal is currently a significant value opportunity. It will require work to remain competitive and keep its revenue growth rates up, and this is the most significant risk I see for the company moving forward.', 'Yet, with a significantly low price, a forward price-earnings ratio of 10 and a fantastic discounted cash flow analysis, one has to wonder why not buy the shares. I know I definitely am. This is as true a value investment as they get; the only question is whether it can double up as a growth stock in the future. Either way, it is a sensible capital allocation while I watch the operations unfold.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

If you want to skip our overview of the energy industry and the latest news, then you can take a look at 5 Most Profitable Energy Stocks. ', 'The energy industry is once again at the center of global attention as 2023 comes to a close. This is because of the COP28 climate conference in Dubai, where governments from nearly every country on the planet agreed to a climate deal after two weeks of intense negotiations. The past two years have been full of dynamism for oil industry participants and investors, as the oil climate surged to feverish pitches in 2022, nearly two years after global demand snapped in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.', ""Year to date, the S&P 500 Energy index is down by 7.31% due to lax demand in a tight industrial environment influenced by high interest rates and persistent inflation. The fall is unsurprising when we take a look at the revenue trends for some of the biggest energy companies in the world, such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL). For instance, Exxon's trailing twelve month revenue currently sits at $346 billion to mark a substantial drop over 2022's figures of $398.6 billion. Similarly, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, Aramco, has witnessed a 200 billion Saudi Riyal revenue drop between its 2022 revenue and the TTM figures for September 2023. However, even as the oil companies' revenues stagger now, over the past three or four years, they have demonstrated remarkable growth."", ""Sticking with Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company brought in SAR1.2 trillion in revenue during 2019, so even though its TTM figures of SAR2 trillion are lower than 2022 sales, they have nearly doubled since the last normal year before COVID-19's full impact on global energy markets. In a similar vein, Exxon raked in $264 billion in 2019, to lead its September 2023 TTM revenue to mark a respectable 31% growth."", ""Therefore, it's clear that even as global delegates wrack their brains to figure out how to save the planet from carbon emissions, big oil is ticking along to ensure that economies can continue to grow. At the same time, global oil prices are weaker, as investors fine tune their 2024 demand prospects keeping the high rates limiting growth right now in mind. In its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) commented on the price trends for oil in November. The organization measures global crude oil prices through its OPEC Reference Basket, or the ORB."", 'In November, ORB dropped by 7.5% month over month to close at $84.92 per barrel. According to OPEC, at the heart of this rather high price drop was widespread speculation in the market driven by the strategies that hedge funds and other financial trading institutions typically engage in to make a return. It shared that the funds and money managers turned bearish about the market in November and started to offload their bullish positions.', 'In its report, the OPEC shares:', 'Crude oil futures prices experienced a significant downturn, marked by heavy selloffs amidst a highly volatile futures market. Speculators played a major role in this trend, cutting their bullish positions sharply while increasing short positions. The market dynamic was fuelled by exaggerated concerns about oil demand growth, which negatively impacted market sentiment. The ICE Brent front-month averaged $6.67, or 7.5%, m-o-m lower in November to stand at $82.03/b, and the NYMEX WTI fell by $8.09, or 9.5%, m-o-m to average $77.38/b. DME Oman crude oil futures prices decreased in November by $6.25, or 7.0%, m-o-m to settle at $83.06/b. Hedge funds and other money managers turned more bearish about crude oil, closing a large volume of bullish futures and options positions, specifically in the NYMEX WTI market. At the same time, they raised bearish positions for nine consecutive weeks to the week of 28 November. This has fuelled volatility and accelerated the decline in oil futures prices. Between late October and the week of 28 November, hedge funds and other money managers sold an equivalent of 89 mb, after liquidating an equivalent of 204 mb in the previous month.', ""Considering the recent trends in the oil industry and the return to normal after 2022's high revenues, we decided to see which energy companies remain the most profitable.

Dividends are a large factor in reducing portfolio risk and volatility, and the dividend itself helps mitigate losses in a stock price. But ultimately, it just feels good to have a company pay you a little bit for having skin in the game.', 'Here are three fantastic dividends with upside: Stellantis (NYSE: STLA), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), and The Home Depot (NYSE: HD).', ""One of the best automotive dividends is often forgotten. Stellantis sometimes lags its crosstown rivals Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) in headlines, but over the past year it's arguably been the best dividend stock of the three."", ""In fact, in terms of stock price performance, Stellantis is up nearly 50% over the past year while Ford and GM declined 18% and 12%, respectively. Stellantis' 6.5% dividend yield tops Ford's 5.5%, and is well above GM's 1.1%."", ""What's even more wild, perhaps, is that Stellantis recently shocked some investors by announcing that its electric vehicles (EVs) were in the black not only in Europe, but in the U.S. market as well. That's well ahead of GM, which predicts its EVs to be profitable in 2025, and Ford, which says its EVs will be in 2026."", ""The automaker has even managed to overtake Tesla for Europe's No. 2 seller of EVs, a feat not to be taken lightly."", ""If you're looking for a stock that's been beating the market and offers a high dividend yield -- with the potential to pour more capital into the dividend as it curbs costs on its EV lineup faster than competitors -- Stellantis is suddenly and quietly becoming a top option in the automotive industry."", 'For stable companies with upside, there might be no better list to check than the stocks Warren Buffett owns. Kraft Heinz is one of his top holdings, valued at nearly $11 billion.', ""Kraft has refocused its growth strategy around three key pillars: Food service, emerging markets, and growth platforms in U.S. retail. The strategy has fueled profitable growth, and that held true in the company's third quarter."", ""Kraft turned in organic net sales growth of 1.7%, which fueled a 12.9% surge in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and a 14.3% jump in adjusted earnings per share, all compared to the prior year's third quarter. Its price increases also gained traction, pushing adjusted gross margin up nearly four percentage points to 34%."", 'Going hand in hand with its profitable growth is a focus on improving productivity across its value chain, and then reinvesting back into marketing and research and development. Management has also been diligent on improving the balance sheet and has reached its target net leverage of roughly 3.0.', 'The upside for income investors is that Kraft trades at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of 15 times earnings, and has a dividend yield of 4.3%. Better yet, as you can see in the graph above, once its profitable growth gains more traction, the company could eventually boost its dividend back up to pre-pandemic levels.', ""The Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement retailer, with more than 2,300 stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The upside for investors is that the home improvement sector is also fragmented, leaving big brands such as Home Depot plenty of room for market share growth."", 'While Home Depot has lagged the broader S&P 500 over the past year, as the company struggled with slowing big-ticket and discretionary categories, it has managed to outperform a key rival.', ""Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) and Home Depot have much in common, but one slight difference is that the former gets roughly 25% of its revenue from professional contractors, while Home Depot generates roughly 50% of its revenue through those contractors."", ""Right now, Home Depot's larger focus on professional contractors is paying off.

The negotiations between United Auto Workers (UAW) and major automakers can sometimes get bitter, and with the former aggressively going after the best contracts in recent memory, it was an ominous development for auto investors.', 'Fortunately, we may already have an answer to the previous question, and it appears to be good news for Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) investors.', 'From the start of negotiations, the UAW made it clear it was going for an ambitious contract that would aim to be the largest amount of gains in wages seen in years. That goal was fairly well accomplished, and the price tag for the new contract hit automakers like Ford and General Motors hard.', ""In fact, Ford anticipates the new UAW contract to cost roughly $8.8 billion -- two times the initial expectation -- over the four-and-a-half-year deal. Ford's crosstown rival, GM, predicts its deal with UAW and Canadian union Unifor will cost up to $9.3 billion."", ""Those are big figures when you consider Ford's updated full-year guidance calls for adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the range of $10 billion to $10.5 billion. Investors are already seeing real impact, as Ford lowered its guidance due to the new contracts from a previous range of $11 billion to $12 billion."", ""Let's put those figures into perhaps more understandable numbers for investors. Ford's new UAW contract will increase costs per vehicle by roughly $900. GM's number is actually lower because it employs roughly 10,000 fewer UAW members than its cross-town rival; GM expects its per-vehicle costs to increase as much as $575 on average throughout the life of the contract."", ""One of the biggest questions now facing major automakers is if they can offset these drastic cost increases. While investors should take these initial comments with a grain of salt -- we don't really expect management to fold and say they're going to go out of business -- both Ford and GM appear confident they can almost completely offset these wage increases."", ""GM management said it's preparing a 2024 budget that should offset much of the increases already. In fact, GM is working to cut $3 billion in fixed costs by the end of 2024."", 'Further, and grain of salt still in hand, it appears labor cost is less significant than it was in the past. ""Labor cost is not as significant from an overall cost perspective as it was in the past,"" Michael Ward, equity research analyst at Benchmark, told Automotive News. ""GM and Ford should be able to offset most of the increase in labor costs with other improvements.""', ""To be fair, if GM management is puffing out its chest to show confidence, it's at least putting its money where its mouth is. GM announced it would buy back $10 billion in shares while also increasing its dividend 33%. If management can confidently announce that right after contract negotiations, they're doing everything they can to appear at ease as they work their 2024 budget to mostly offset the new contracts."", ""Investing in cyclical industries, especially the automotive industry, which is notoriously capital intensive, isn't for everyone. However, for value investors, or perhaps income investors, there's a compelling case for both Ford and General Motors right now. Ford and GM trade at a cheap price-to-earnings ratio of 7 and 4.7 times earnings, respectively, and have declined 16% and 12%, respectively, compared to the market's 17% gain over the past year."", ""On top of being cheap, Ford also offers income investors a juicy 5.4% dividend yield. While GM's yield is much lower, management's recent decision to boost the dividend 33% with a $10 billion share buyback plan shows willingness to return value to shareholders."", 'If management of both automakers prove they can execute and offset much of the new labor costs, this could be a great entry point into the two Detroit auto stocks before they bounce back.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Ford Motor Company wasn't one of them.

So basically the news here is that activist investor, Nelson Peltz, plans to nominate himself. That's really important."", 'And this is interesting. The part where they\'re also nominating Jay Rasulo, who was, of course, the former Disney CFO. So this is a guy who, obviously, has a very deep knowledge, background, insight into the company. He is talking tough, by the way. He\'s saying, ""The Disney I know and love has lost its way.""', ""Lots of questions here, obviously. One, is Peltz actually going to be successful here? Pull this off. And in addition, what is Mr. Peltz's plan here? What's his strategy exactly?"", ""Because Bob Iger could say, of course, listen, Nelson, I have been working here. I have been making moves. I've been cost cutting. I've been adding-- listen, we've been adding power hitters to the board. Recently announced, Morgan Stanley's Chief, James Gorman, is joining its board of directors. We'll see how it shakes out."", ""- We'll see how it shakes out. I mean, the stock has recovered a little bit as of late. Although--"", ""- It's about 8%."", ""- You could argue-- it's up 8% this year but it's really bounced like in the month of November, specifically. You could argue that's because of Peltz's involvement and not necessarily because of anything Iger himself is doing. So we'll see how that works out."", ""But as you and I have talked about before, there does seem to be-- it feels like there's a personal element to all of this.

But, again, tied to autonomous driving.', ""So I think there are bigger questions here. Yes, there's stuff that's specific to cruise but it feels like we're at a moment where there's some bigger questions about where we are with true autonomous driving."", '- Yeah. t remember two GM execs did say, just a few weeks ago, when they reported some color about this, they did say, listen, we expect kind of the pace of cruise expansion is going to be more deliberate. They noted, listen, we understand, trust has to be kind of rebuilt here at this point, with regulators, after these incidents. And they said to expect substantially lower spending at cruise. So they kind of laid it out there for you.', ""- They did lay it out, although it's interesting that the stock is seeing such an upside today, even after they gave some hints that this was going to be happening. Yeah."", ""- And finally, let's turn to Schwab here. Shares of Schwab rising today after the bank reported a rise in core net new assets.

It's down about 15% in 2023. Though we should know, I mean, many of the analysts see better days ahead. You've got about 20 buys on the stock."", '- Yeah, so the story for Schwab this year was that it was caught up in the regional banking crisis. There were concerns about deposit outflows from the company. So this latest month showing that there are some reassurance on that front with those net new assets climbing by the pace that they did.', ""And at the same time that we are hearing this from Schwab, just wanted to mention a broader milestone as well, which is that if you look at regional banks, and Schwab is not a regional bank, per se, but was caught up in that whole thing, we are seeing regional banks come back to the level where they were before the collapse of SVB. We're looking at a couple of the different indices there of those regional banks and we've recovered the losses now that were incurred in the April, May time frame."", ""So it's interesting that Schwab is making this announcement today at the same time that's happening. Emblematic of--"", ""- I mean, to your point-- you're absolutely right. The regional banks-- look at some of those ETFs. They've popped like 20% in four weeks. I mean, it was a big jump."", ""- Yeah.

Listen in on any corporate earnings call, and you’d hear CEOs like Amazon’s (AMZN) Andy Jassy, Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, Intel’s (INTC) Pat Gelsinger, and AMD’s (AMD) Lisa Su\xa0tout their companies’ AI capabilities.', 'Heck, even Wendy’s (WEN) got in on the action, adding a generative AI assistant to its drive-through in May as part of a test program. The fast-food chain is expanding it to more locations in 2024.', 'AI might have been the most important story of 2023, but it actually started to gain steam in November 2022 when OpenAI released ChatGPT. The chatbot quickly became the fastest-growing app in history to that point, reaching 100 million monthly users in just two months.', 'Nevertheless, here are some of the highlights from the biggest story of 2023: the generative AI explosion.', 'On the heels of ChatGPT’s success, Microsoft, in January, announced it was investing $10 billion in OpenAI over several years. In February, with rumors swirling that Microsoft was set to launch its own AI chatbot powered by ChatGPT, Google debuted its Bard bot. The unveiling, however, was light on details. Days later, Microsoft took the wraps off of its Bing chatbot and new Edge browser. Both Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took the stage, explaining the partnership and how the two companies would bring generative AI to Microsoft’s customers.', 'Google jumped in, opening up access to Bard to a limited number of users. The move was largely seen as a means for Google to keep pace with one of its biggest competitors in the tech space. Not to be outdone, in March, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, announced AI was the company’s largest investment.', 'Google announced that it was bringing together its Brain AI team from Google Research and DeepMind to form a new AI-first organization: Google DeepMind. That same month Amazon announced its Bedrock platform, giving enterprise customers access to generative AI foundation models and its own Titan foundation models.', 'Google kept pouring on the news. It opened up its Bard chatbot to the public. It also launched its Search Generative Experience, a generative AI-powered version of Google Search, during its I/O developer conference. Microsoft then fired back by revealing that it was bringing its AI-powered Windows Copilot to Windows 11. Oh, and Nvidia’s market capitalization briefly topped $1 trillion for the first time, cementing its status as the AI chip leader.', 'As AI continued to generate headlines, the Biden administration announced that it secured agreements from Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to abide by voluntary rules related to AI safety and development. Also in July, Microsoft announced it would charge customers $30 per month per user for its Microsoft 365 Copilot, which adds generative AI capabilities to the company’s productivity suite. The next month, in August, Google responded, saying it will also demand $30 per month, per user for its own generative AI productivity offering, Duet AI for Workspace.', 'Amazon, keen on getting deeper into generative AI, announced it was investing $4 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Meta also revealed it was rolling out AI stickers across its apps and a new AI assistant for WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. It also rolled out AI personalities — featuring celebrities like Tom Brady and Kendall Jenner. Also in September: With rising fears of AI being used in negative ways — and no sign of movement from Congress — the Biden administration signed an executive order seeking to address potential cybersecurity, discrimination, and growth questions related to AI.', 'OpenAI hosted its first developer event in November, unveiling a more powerful version of GPT-4 called GPT-4 Turbo and an app store for ChatGPT called the GPT Store. (That\'s where customers can buy customized versions of the company’s AI software.) Then all hell broke loose at OpenAI. The board fired CEO Sam Altman seemingly out of nowhere. Microsoft stepped in and offered him a job, hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to resign, and OpenAI finally brought back Altman with some new board members, including a nonvoting ""observer"" role for Microsoft. Meanwhile, Amazon announced its own Q chatbot to better compete with the likes of Microsoft and Google.', 'December:', 'Finally, this month, Google unveiled its GPT-4 competitor Gemini.', 'And here’s the thing, that’s not even all of the AI news that made headlines this year.

Shares fell about 10% immediately following the recent earnings update. For Oracle shareholders who have been around a while, though, 2023 has been nothing to complain about. Despite the recent drop, the stock is still up 23% with just weeks to go until the new year, capping off a market-beating total return (including reinvested dividends) of 250% over the last decade.', ""Does this recent sell-off suggest it might be time to buy Oracle stock for 2024? Let's take a closer look and try to find an answer."", 'Oracle reported its financial results this week for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (the three-month period that ended in November 2023), and it was another solid quarter. Total revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.9 billion, driven by cloud computing segment growth of 25% to $4.8 billion. Breaking the cloud segment down further revealed the following:', ""Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) revenue is up 52% year over year to $1.6 billion, further validating Oracle's early adoption of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI) systems and software."", 'Software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue -- including the Cerner healthcare software business, which was acquired in the summer of 2022 -- rose 15% year over year to $3.2 billion/', ""Even better, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share rose 41% year over year, or 11% on an (non-GAAP) adjusted basis. That's exactly the type of profit growth performance that should please investors in a big mature business like this one."", ""So why the post-earnings stock slump? Hyperfocus was turned to the cloud segment, where CEO Safra Katz and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison had said a few months ago to expect cloud growth of at least 29%, resulting in overall revenue growth of up to 7%. Adjusted earnings-per-share growth did wind up at the high end of the outlook anyway, but the market didn't seem impressed enough with the outlook. Such are the vagaries of how the market rationalizes such things in the short term."", ""With its pivot to cloud-based infrastructure and services, paired with big bets on generative AI, Oracle has established itself in the ever-evolving fabric of the tech sector in the years ahead. Nevertheless, as I pointed out in October following the company's AI event, some investors were expecting elevated growth for Oracle Cloud would kick in far sooner."", ""Put simply, Oracle's buildout of AI infrastructure (again, thanks in no small part to Nvidia) is going to take time. And that infrastructure trickling down to higher software service growth may take even longer. Additionally, there's been a general slowdown in cloud software spending in 2023, and Oracle (except for its IaaS segment) hasn't been exempt."", ""But here's the good news: Even at just a mere single-digit revenue growth rate, Oracle is still stoking low-teens-percentage earnings-per-share growth from its lumbering cloud operation. Q3 fiscal 2024 (which ends in February of calendar year 2024) adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow 10% to 14% year over year."", ""And after yet another tumble, Oracle stock now trades for about 16 times Wall Street analysts' estimates for next year's earnings, or about 22 times next year's expected free cash flow (which aligns a bit more closely with adjusted earnings). It's now a far more reasonable price tag than earlier in 2023 when Oracle's rate of expansion was being boosted by the integration of Cerner, as well as generative AI hype."", ""At this juncture, Oracle stock doesn't exactly look like a crazy good deal for 2024, but the value looks pretty decent for investors wanting to buy and forget an all-weather cloud stock ready for the AI era."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Oracle wasn't one of them.

After all, the company was hit hard by the crash in personal computer (PC) sales, and it failed to take advantage of the fast-growing demand for data center graphics cards on account of the growing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) servers.', ""However, investors seem upbeat about AMD's prospects going into 2024. The stock surged 16% in the past week after unveiling a new line of AI chips on Dec. 6, which it says have been selected by major cloud service providers for deployment in their AI servers. These new chips, no doubt, could give AMD's growth a nice boost considering the booming demand and short supply of AI-related chips."", ""But will AMD's advent into the AI chip market be enough to help drive a sustained rally in the company's stock over the next three years? Let's find out."", ""The market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs) heated up significantly in 2023, and Nvidia made the most of this opportunity with its H100 and A100 graphics cards. Nvidia's A100 became a hot commodity when it emerged that it was deployed by the thousands to train ChatGPT, the popular chatbot from OpenAI."", ""The raging popularity of ChatGPT triggered a race between tech giants, governments, and start-ups to get their hands on the most powerful GPUs available to train AI models. Nvidia has been the prime beneficiary of this demand, as its recent results indicate. However, Nvidia hasn't been able to produce enough chips to satisfy the huge customer demand. The waiting period for its H100 and A100 data center GPUs runs as high as 52 weeks, which means that customers need to look elsewhere to procure more chips."", 'So, it was not surprising to see AMD pointing out last week that the likes of Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms will be adopting its MI300X and MI300A accelerators for training AI models and also for tackling AI inferencing workloads. Microsoft, for instance, has already deployed a new cloud instance powered by the MI300X, while Oracle plans to use this processor to power its upcoming generative AI service.', 'Meanwhile, data center infrastructure providers such as Dell, Lenovo, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be adding the MI300 accelerators to their server systems. All this explains why AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company anticipates at least $2 billion in revenue from sales of data center GPUs next year. Su points out that AMD secured enough supply and has a strong customer lineup that could help it generate more than $2 billion in sales from its new chips.', ""That points toward a significant ramp-up when compared to the $400 million revenue the company expects to generate from selling data center GPUs in the current quarter. What's more, Su claims that AMD's chip can equal Nvidia's H100 as far as training AI models is concerned. She also added that the MI300X could perform better at AI inferencing, which refers to the process of deploying the trained model to make predictions or solve problems."", 'The AMD CEO is also quite bullish about the state of the AI chip market. Su now sees an addressable market worth $400 billion for AI data center accelerators by 2027, up substantially from the prior estimate of $150 billion. Nvidia is currently the dominant player in this space, with an estimated market share of 80%. However, if AMD could corner even 10% of this market after five years, its revenue from the data center GPU business alone could hit $40 billion.', 'That would be significantly higher than the $2 billion revenue the company is estimating from this segment in 2024. Also, the chipmaker expects to finish 2023 with $22.6 billion in revenue, which means that even a small share of the data center GPU market can double its top line in five years.', ""Analysts anticipate AMD's revenue to increase at a pace of 16% in 2024 and 2025, which would be a nice improvement following this year's estimated decline of 4%. This is evident from the chart below."", ""Assuming AMD's top line jumps 16% in 2026 as well, its annual revenue could hit almost $36 billion after three years. AMD currently has a price-to-sales ratio of 10. Multiplying that with its projected sales of $36 billion points toward a market cap of $360 billion after three years, pointing toward a 62% jump from current levels."", 'However, AMD may be able to deliver even stronger gains by clocking faster revenue growth, which could lead the market to reward it with a higher sales multiple. As such, investors looking to buy an AI stock without having to pay through their noses may want to buy AMD before it becomes expensive like other AI plays.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.', 'The AI race is intensifying: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is doubling the pace of its artificial intelligence (AI) chip launch cycle and integrating the latest memory technology into its servers for higher compute capacity. We expect key competitors to follow suit.', 'Increased AI usage requires more compute power, which requires more memory. While we continue to view this as a cyclical industry, we expect durable, multi-year demand growth for memory manufacturers.', 'Hard disk drive and memory manufacturers should benefit from shortages: Production capacity for HDDs and memory was cut substantially over the last two years, from 25 to 40% across manufacturers. Demand is recovering for the data centers, PCs, and smartphones that use these components.', 'We think end-customersand the marketare underestimating the degree of undersupply and the time it will take to restore sufficient capacity. Supply of HDDs and memory may fall short of 2024 demand, even if sluggish, favoring their manufacturers. We also note these two industries have largely consolidated over the past decade, and industry participants have demonstrated business discipline in the current cycle.', ""Shallow downcycle for overall equipment spend: China's semiconductor manufacturing is buoying overall equipment spending. China's spending levels may be peaking but, in my view, should not decline precipitously, given China's ongoing domestic capacity additions to increase self-reliance. For the next upcycle, technology transitions, such as a new transistor architecture, should support complex semiconductor manufacturing."", 'Conor Muldoon, Fundamental Portfolio Manager', 'Coverage: Finanicials, Materials, Real Estate', 'I spent a week in London meeting with real estate investment trusts (REITs). Here are some insights on real estate segments in the UK and US.', ""UK Office and Retail: Old office stock appears distressed, exemplified by a 100 million bid for a building that sold in 2015 for 260 million. London office properties benefit from a diverse occupier base, but valuations may continue to decline as rental growth is offset by rising cap rates (a property's net operating income/market value). Tenant preferences are growing increasingly distinct: for quality or new buildings, prime city locations and, in retail, parks over indoor malls."", 'UK Logistics: Occupier demand for warehouses, data centers, and transport businesses has normalized after the strong Covid period. London logistics pricing is robust due to supply constraints and demand for priority delivery. Transaction volume has declined due to a spike in interest rates, with buyers and sellers still wide apart on valuations. Many companies expressed the desire to be well-capitalized for future purchases during the upcycle.', 'US Residential: The outlook varies across regions: rental income pressure is anticipated in the Sunbelt for the next few years due to unprecedented new supply levels. Demand is weak in San Francisco and Seattle but so far resilient in Southern California, although non-paying tenants and high levels of bad debt are challenging Los Angeles markets. Despite positive renewals, new lease rates are expected to decline while various factors like client selection and property location and type contribute to the market dynamics.', 'US Shopping Center: There has been a decade without new supply in US shopping centers and current high cap rates are deterring new development. Anchor tenants, mainly grocery stores, often pay rents 30-40% below market. Smaller shops generally have high occupancy and pay close to market rates. In many instances, cash conversion (cash flow/net rental income) and tenant sales have remained strong, with current tenants interested in adding space.', 'US Hotels: A recovery in group travel continues, but 2023 levels are still 10% below those of 2019. Leisure rates are substantially above 2019 levels but are expected to gradually decline, partially offset by a recovery in international tourism. Activity from frequent business travelers remains below pre-Covid levels, so this segment may be more resilient in an economic downturn.', 'David Khoo Fundamental Senior Research Analyst', 'Coverage: Financials, Real Estate', 'I traveled through Singapore, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou for company meetings and property tours. These themes emerged from my research.', 'Chinese retail landlords are adjusting to changing consumption patterns: Mass-market consumers have been more cautious, focusing on value, and shifting towards experiential purchases like dining and entertainment. To continue attracting shoppers, many landlords are changing the tenant mix and shrinking individual store sizes to broaden variety. Such repositioning can be dilutive to returns, but the properties I toured have largely completed the adjustment process.', 'Retail supply is relatively disciplined in Singapore and Hong Kong: To manage land constraints, urban planners generally match new supply of non-discretionary retail to new residential estate developments, which limits the cannibalization of existing properties. Properties with direct connections to public transportation have a material competitive advantage.', 'Mixed bag for Hong Kong real estate companies: Residential prices are down and office properties oversupplied, but balance sheets are generally conservative with lowand decliningleverage. Equity valuations have derated significantly, creating investment opportunities in quality assets that may outperform over a longer-term horizon.', 'Excess liquidity in Singapore and Hong Kong: High interest rates have not only reduced demand for new borrowing but also incentivized debt repayments. Given the competition for quality borrowers, many companies have been able to reduce credit spreads for refinancings.', 'Claudia Crivello, Fundamental Research Analyst', 'Coverage: Consumer', 'I spent a week in Japan meeting with cosmetics, food & beverage, and retailing companies. I also had a chance to visit many of the retail store formats in Japan. These are my key takeaways.', 'The Japanese economy has continued to benefit from reopening: Japan was one of the last developed markets to open from Covid lockdowns, at the end of 2022. Many companies reported tourist levels reaching or surpassing pre-Covid levels, although the mix includes fewer Chinese tourists. As for domestic consumers, their purchasing is bifurcated between luxury and value (down-traded) goods over mid-priced products.', 'Consumer companies are increasing prices for the first time in decades: Sales volumes are holding up under these increases and some companies are considering additional price raises to help offset cost inflation, particularly given a weaker yen. After years of stagnant pricing, future price increases could become an attractive driver of future top-line growth for companies.', 'Some companies are raising wages but lowering headcount: Because of inflation, many companies have increased wages. The Japanese government and major labor unions plan to meet regarding a mandatory wage increase in 2024. But some companies plan to reduce headcount to offset rising employment costs, a practice rarely exercised by Japanese companies.', 'Japanese cosmetics companies are selling less to Chinese customers. The economic slowdown in China, below-average Chinese travel, and concerns over treated waste-water release from the Fukushima nuclear power plant have depressed sales of Japanese cosmetics to Chinese customers. Some cosmetic companies (along with other consumer packaged goods companies) are rethinking long-term investments in China.', 'Convenience stores and drugstores are gaining share from supermarkets and department stores. Japanese shoppers are prioritizing price and convenience, favoring these store formats. Convenience store food sales are strong, and drugstore companies are using profits from high-margin segments to subsidize lower prices on products that compete with supermarkets. General home and apparel retailers are ceding share to specialty retailers.', ""This market commentary expresses Causeway's views as of December 2023 and should not be relied on as research or investment advice regarding any stock.

Wall Street currently forecasts about 23% upside potential in the next 12 months. Plus, Recursion’s strategic partnership with some big names, including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), to revolutionize AI in drug discovery has Wall Street optimistic about its long-term potential.', 'Recursion’s commitment to tackling rare diseases will drive its fundamentals in the right direction, which is why I believe it has the potential to shine bright over the long term. Hence, I am bullish on RXRX stock.', 'Recursion Pharmaceuticals utilizes AI and advanced automation to rapidly identify potential drug candidates and accelerate the traditionally time-consuming process of developing new treatments. By leveraging technology to explore the complexities of rare genetic conditions, the company aims to develop therapies that were previously deemed unfeasible or overlooked.', 'Biotech companies aiming to cure hard-to-treat diseases will always remain in demand despite macroeconomic conditions. This is probably why famous investor Cathie Wood, who is known for her investments in hyper-growth, disruptive businesses, recently increased her stake in this biotech stock. According to\xa0TheStreet,\xa0Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK)\xa0purchased around 1.9 million shares of Recursion, amounting to $12.3 million.', 'In total, ARK holds roughly\xa09.7 million shares\xa0of Recursion, with the investment totaling $80.7 million. Recursion accounts for 0.92% of the ARKK ETF.', 'Clinical-stage biotech companies often take time to be profitable. Recursion’s total revenue in Q3 dipped to $10.5 million compared to $13.2 million in Q3 2022. Its net loss in the quarter came in at $93 million, up from $60.4 million in the prior year quarter. However, Recursion is making every effort to turn its bottom line green.', 'Currently, it has many promising drug candidates in clinical trials. Also, in July, tech giant NVIDIA made a\xa0$50 million investment\xa0in Recursion. As part of the deal, Recursion will use NVIDIA’s accelerated computing capabilities to develop its AI foundation models for drug discovery.', 'In its recent Q3 report, the company announced the expansion of its on-premise supercomputer, BioHive-1, which it expects to complete by the first half of 2024. The company believes that adding NVIDIA’s most popular and efficient H100 GPUs (graphic processing units) will increase BioHive-1’s computational capacity by over 4x.', 'Management noted that once complete, “BioHive-1 will be in the top 50 most powerful supercomputers in the world across any industry (according to the Top500 list) and will be the most powerful supercomputer owned and operated by any biopharma company.”', 'Besides NVIDIA, Recursion has collaborations with other prominent healthcare companies, such as\xa0Bayer AG\xa0and\xa0Roche-Genentech, for various oncology programs.', 'Furthermore, Recursion has a partnership with\xa0Tempus\xa0to use its “oncology-focused clinical and DNA/RNA molecular observational datasets.”\xa0The agreement calls for Recursion to pay Tempus a total of up to $160 million in cash or equity over the next five years.', 'It is also heavily increasing its research and development (R&D) expenses to expand and strengthen its drug discovery capabilities. In the third quarter, R&D expenses totaled $70 million.', 'Following its Q3 results, Needham analyst\xa0Gil Blum\xa0reiterated a Buy rating on RXRX, highlighting its strategic partnerships with Tempus and Bayer as one of the reasons for the rating.\xa0The analyst is also impressed with the company’s financial status and its pipeline progress. For context, Recursion had a $387.3 million cash balance at the end of the third quarter.', 'Overall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy rating on RXRX stock. Out of the three analysts covering the stock, one rates the stock a Buy, while two rate it a Hold. The average price target for RXRX stock is $11.33, implying 23.2% upside potential.', 'Biotech stocks are risky, as trials may fail or the company may fail to get approval for its potential candidates. This could mean that it will be years before RXRX’s bottom line turns green.', 'That said, disruptive technologies like AI bring a lot of lucrative prospects for companies dipping their hands in this niche. Once its potential candidates get approved and released into the market, doors of opportunity will open for Recursion.', 'This potential success could lead to more strategic investments and partnerships, which would strengthen the company’s fundamentals and likely turn it profitable. I believe these reasons make a compelling high-risk, high-reward case for Recursion. Hence, I share Wall Street’s enthusiasm for this biotech stock.', 'Disclosure']"

With a GDP that exceeds $25 trillion, the US dwarfs most competitors. Even some of the states in the US have a higher GDP than many of the biggest and most successful countries in the world. The US dollar is also the world’s most dominant reserve currency.', 'One of the main reasons behind the economic dominance of the US is its unwavering commitment to innovation. The constant pursuit of new advancements across various industries has helped the US rank high among the most advanced countries in the world in 2023. Further innovations are expected to help in advancing America’s economy in the coming years.', 'According to a report by JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The report also mentions that the fiscal deficit, which stood at $950 billion in 2022, almost doubled in fiscal 2023 to reach $1.84 trillion or 7.4% of the country’s GDP. The federal government took in a lot less cash than it sent out this year. The federal deficit is expected to narrow down in 2024 to 5.9% of GDP, which would still be a lot.

We expect segment sales to increase 3.5% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.That said, the company’s Pet segment retail sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were somewhat affected by pet parents’ shift toward value products and channels, along with smaller pack sizes. Additionally, the company has been witnessing challenges in the wet food and treats categories, with pet parents spending more time at work or away from home. Management expects the difficult category dynamics to persist in the Pet segment throughout fiscal 2024 as it does not see any major change in economic viewpoint for pet parents in the near term. This raises concerns about the quarter under review as well.Apart from this, General Mills input cost inflation has been moderating. On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that the biggest factors impacting its performance in fiscal 2024 are likely to be consumers’ economic status, the moderating rate of cost inflation and the rising stability of supply-chain status.

280,ef4c914e-a390-3788-98dd-43b55ceda5b9,DVN,2023-12-15,Devon Energy Is Great. Here's Why You Shouldn't Buy The Stock.,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ef4c914e-a390-3788-98dd-43b55ceda5b9/devon-energy-is-great.-here%27s.html,1702635000,STORY,['DVN'],"[""Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) is an onshore U.S. energy producer with a 6.5% dividend yield. That may lead income investors to consider the stock, given that the average energy stock, using Vanguard Energy Index ETF (NYSEMKT: VDE) as a proxy, has a yield of just 3.5%. Only there's an important thing to consider about Devon Energy before you buy it if you are looking to live off of the income your portfolio generates."", ""One of the first things that investors need to understand about Devon Energy is that it is solely focused on the upstream portion of the oil industry. So unlike an integrated energy company such as ExxonMobil, which has assets across the energy value chain, Devon only owns oil and gas production assets. That's the upstream sector, and it means that energy prices are effectively the driving force behind the company's financial results."", ""Oil and natural gas are commodities and are prone to dramatic and often rapid price changes. So Devon's financial results can sometimes swing pretty wildly. As an example, in the third quarter of 2023, Devon's adjusted earnings were $1.62 per share. That was up from $1.18 in Q2. That's a big change in just a single quarter and it was largely driven by a spike in oil prices. But it gets more interesting because in Q3 of 2022, Devon's adjusted earnings were $2.18 per share, with the difference again driven by the prices of the commodities it produces."", ""Devon's stock price will roughly track energy prices, as the chart below shows, which might actually be what you want as an investor. And Devon is a well-respected energy producer. Notably, it has a roughly $40-per-barrel break-even point, which is strong. And it has over 10 years' worth of drilling inventory ahead of it. So far, so good, assuming you want to own an energy stock. The potential problem is that lofty dividend yield."", ""What's not to like about a solid energy company with an above-average dividend yield? The answer is the dividend policy, which is variable. Over the past two years, the dividend has been as high as $1.55 per share in the third quarter of 2022 and as low as $0.49 in Q3 of 2023. The dividend yield that you see listed for the stock really isn't a reliable gauge of the income you can expect to receive. If you are looking to create a consistent income stream off of which you can live in retirement, Devon Energy is probably best avoided."", ""That said, there is one situation where it might make sense to own Devon Energy. The company's dividend will, more or less, track the price of energy. So, when oil and natural gas are rising, the dividend will likely increase, and vice versa. That means you will collect more income from Devon just as you are facing higher costs for things like gasoline and heating fuel. Thus, it could be considered a hedge against real-world energy costs."", ""Although Devon's ability to help hedge real-world energy costs with its variable dividend policy is interesting, most investors probably don't think about investing in this way. As such, despite the company being a perfectly good upstream energy stock, most folks will probably want to err on the side of caution in this volatile sector and pick an energy option that offers a less volatile income stream. An integrated energy giant like ExxonMobil would likely be a better starting point, as it has increased its dividend annually for over four decades."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Devon Energy wasn't one of them.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at United Rentals (NYSE:URI) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.', ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for United Rentals:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.18 = US$3.9b ÷ (US$26b - US$3.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, United Rentals has an ROCE of 18%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 13% generated by the Trade Distributors industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals ', ""In the above chart we have measured United Rentals' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for United Rentals."", ""Investors would be pleased with what's happening at United Rentals. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 18%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 55%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers."", 'To sum it up, United Rentals has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 433% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.', ""One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with United Rentals and understanding it should be part of your investment process."", 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Three stocks that are big names within their respective industries and that can make for excellent long-term investments are UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). These businesses have excellent track records, they pay their shareholders dividends, and their futures remain bright."", ""Healthcare and insurance are two relatively safe places of the economy for investors to focus on. There's an ongoing need for both of those services and one company that gives you the best of both worlds is health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group. It has also made for a fantastic growth stock, having doubled in a span of just five years."", ""At a market capitalization of around $500 billion, it's one of the most valuable healthcare companies in the world. The company doesn't have the greatest bottom line as it has averaged a profit margin of just 6% over the trailing 12 months. But UnitedHealth generates over $300 billion in revenue on an annual basis, which means that at a 6% margin, it can still generate more than $18 billion in profit each year. Over the past four quarters, its earnings have been higher than that, at $21.7 billion."", 'UnitedHealth is also always on the hunt to get bigger. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to acquire home health company Amedisys for $3.3 billion. That builds off its $5.4 billion acquisition of another home health business, LHC Group. With a plethora of profits and cash coming through its business, UnitedHealth is in excellent shape to continue growing and expanding via acquisitions in the long run.', ""Investors also have plenty of incentive to hold on to the stock as UnitedHealth pays a dividend that yields 1.4%. And while that may seem modest, it's deceptively low as the company has an excellent track record for dividend growth. "", ""UnitedHealth is one of the safest healthcare stocks investors can own, and it's a no-brainer if you want an investment that you don't want to worry about."", ""Soft drink giant Coca-Cola doesn't need much of an introduction. Go into any grocery store or restaurant within the country and there's a good chance you'll find one of its products either being served or available for purchase. The simplicity of its business is what makes it appealing to long-term investors such as Warren Buffett; Coca-Cola is among the top holdings in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio."", ""Coca-Cola earns great margins on its products. In the past 12 months, the company's profit margin has been just under one-quarter of the top line. The business has been resilient, even in the midst of rising costs. Its low-priced products make it easier for Coca-Cola to raise prices without making them appear too expensive.

That ability to evolve is an important one for long-term investors to consider, which is why the business is a solid one to hang on to for years.

And the stock is a Dividend King, making it highly probable that the dividend income you earn from the stock will increase over time.', ""Another big name for investors to consider is Oracle. The brand has become synonymous with databases but it's also much more than that. These days, it's also focusing on the rising popularity of artificial intelligence (AI). Chief Technology Officer and Chairman Larry Ellison stated earlier this year that the company was spending billions of dollars on AI chips from Nvidia as it aims to grow its cloud computing business. "", ""Oracle's strong profit margins in excess of 18% put it in a great position to pump more money into AI so that it can take advantage of what's proving to be a hot trend not just in tech, but in other industries as well, with companies looking for ways to make their operations more efficient. The company pays a dividend yield of 1.4% but it's not getting in the way of growth; Oracle's payout ratio is around 43% of profits. That leaves plenty of room for the company to invest back into its growth opportunities."", 'Shares of Oracle are up more than 40% this year, but with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of just over 20, the stock is trading in line with the S&P 500 average.

Shares fell about 10% immediately following the recent earnings update. For Oracle shareholders who have been around a while, though, 2023 has been nothing to complain about. Despite the recent drop, the stock is still up 23% with just weeks to go until the new year, capping off a market-beating total return (including reinvested dividends) of 250% over the last decade.', ""Does this recent sell-off suggest it might be time to buy Oracle stock for 2024? Let's take a closer look and try to find an answer."", 'Oracle reported its financial results this week for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (the three-month period that ended in November 2023), and it was another solid quarter. Total revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.9 billion, driven by cloud computing segment growth of 25% to $4.8 billion. Breaking the cloud segment down further revealed the following:', ""Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) revenue is up 52% year over year to $1.6 billion, further validating Oracle's early adoption of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI) systems and software."", 'Software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue -- including the Cerner healthcare software business, which was acquired in the summer of 2022 -- rose 15% year over year to $3.2 billion/', ""Even better, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share rose 41% year over year, or 11% on an (non-GAAP) adjusted basis. That's exactly the type of profit growth performance that should please investors in a big mature business like this one."", ""So why the post-earnings stock slump? Hyperfocus was turned to the cloud segment, where CEO Safra Katz and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison had said a few months ago to expect cloud growth of at least 29%, resulting in overall revenue growth of up to 7%. Adjusted earnings-per-share growth did wind up at the high end of the outlook anyway, but the market didn't seem impressed enough with the outlook. Such are the vagaries of how the market rationalizes such things in the short term."", ""With its pivot to cloud-based infrastructure and services, paired with big bets on generative AI, Oracle has established itself in the ever-evolving fabric of the tech sector in the years ahead. Nevertheless, as I pointed out in October following the company's AI event, some investors were expecting elevated growth for Oracle Cloud would kick in far sooner."", ""Put simply, Oracle's buildout of AI infrastructure (again, thanks in no small part to Nvidia) is going to take time. And that infrastructure trickling down to higher software service growth may take even longer. Additionally, there's been a general slowdown in cloud software spending in 2023, and Oracle (except for its IaaS segment) hasn't been exempt."", ""But here's the good news: Even at just a mere single-digit revenue growth rate, Oracle is still stoking low-teens-percentage earnings-per-share growth from its lumbering cloud operation. Q3 fiscal 2024 (which ends in February of calendar year 2024) adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow 10% to 14% year over year."", ""And after yet another tumble, Oracle stock now trades for about 16 times Wall Street analysts' estimates for next year's earnings, or about 22 times next year's expected free cash flow (which aligns a bit more closely with adjusted earnings). It's now a far more reasonable price tag than earlier in 2023 when Oracle's rate of expansion was being boosted by the integration of Cerner, as well as generative AI hype."", ""At this juncture, Oracle stock doesn't exactly look like a crazy good deal for 2024, but the value looks pretty decent for investors wanting to buy and forget an all-weather cloud stock ready for the AI era."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Oracle wasn't one of them.

I would now like to turn the call over to Tee Green Executive Chairman."", ""Thank you, Jacob, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As previously announced on October 13th, 2023, the company executed a strategic restructuring when Steve was promoted to the role of CEO, supported by BJ. Ray's as our interim CFO, for I've stepped into the role of Executive Chairman since the execution of the restructuring, the strategic decisions made by Ben and BJ have confirmed the board's confidence in this leadership team. Streamline remains committed to its mission to ensure our health system clients are compensated for the care they provide this has never been more critical for our nation's health systems. And we know that preserving in our effort to deliver prebuilt revenue cycle solutions will deliver tremendous value for clients. Shareholders and our associates. The Board and management understand the long-term value of this business and are evaluating several options to improve the Company's financial flexibility. We expect to update you in the near future on our progress. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ben, a corporate update, Ben?"", ""Since the restructuring, I've been impressed by the dedication and commitment of our associates, their drive for success and ability to rapidly evolve in a changing situation for strategic decisions we announced in October allow us to continue to deliver value for our current clients efficiently convert our backlog to live revenue and focus our sales execution, all while realizing significant cost savings. And we expect that these savings have meaningfully lowered our future breakeven run rate today, we believe that a $15.5 million SaaS ARR run rate will translate to persistent adjusted EBITDA generation and that any ARR generated beyond that level will result in gross margins in excess of 80% with significant operating leverage. As we announced yesterday, booked SaaS ACV, which is the annual contract value for all agreements currently being recognized as well as bookings that have not been implemented, totals $14.5 million. Of that, approximately $11.2 million has already been implemented. Following the restructuring, our client success team has had an increased emphasis on connecting with each of our clients, ensuring they understand their overall satisfaction with our products and provide clarity about the changes we were making at Streamline, they continue to be supported by our clients rely on our solutions to successfully collect all the cash they're owed for their services and are overwhelmingly happy with our team and their results. As evidence, our team has recently able to convert some of our single year renewal contracts to three-year contracts. One of our clients are so pleased with our eValuator solution that they asked for a five year renewal in conjunction with transitioning to Epic's EHR within our backlog, the team successfully completed the implementation of a $1 million SaaS ACV rev ID project with a large multi health system client during the final and final end user training, the super user, their free latest excitement to the facility staffed by saying we have never been able to look across our systems. The way rev ID enables us to this tool will allow us to get accurately paid for the care we provide. It was gratifying to see our client comprehend and echo our company mission on profit and this was the first health system to go live on revenue within a much larger multi-region client suite. We believe that the combination of our smooth implementation, talented client success team and substantial financial impact will allow us to expand our relationship in fiscal 2024. Our implementation team's effectiveness has been enhanced by this year's architecture improvements, and we expect that they will continue to improve their processes, resulting in a smoother client experience while reducing our overall expense. Our innovation team was the most impacted by our restructuring during the past 18-months. We made significant improvements to both platforms, including Remedy's architecture and evaluators AIML. system, which enhances rule development to drive cleaner way. And so today, the innovation group is aligned as one team and leadership structure, which allows them to work on the top priorities regardless of solution. Currently, those priorities include the completion of a significant user interface upgrade for evaluator and client facing features for remedy combined innovation leadership structure also allowed for new opportunities for high-potential leaders. We have been cultivating. And to be clear, we believe that the development progress we've already made with eValuator and remedy are sufficient to maintain a strong competitive edge in the marketplace while allowing us to aim our efforts in response to the growth direction of the business. And so turning to that growth team, we're now focused on four key strategies with specific named accounts where we believe we can execute and have shown success strategy strategies include one, a displacement campaign related to an existing offering in evaluator space, where we believe our tool delivers significantly better results in a SaaS format instead of an on-premise infrastructure heavy format two, a continued emphasis on our Oracle partnership, which continues to aggressively push rev ID3, the development of a new and effective channel partner for the last one Beyond new client sales, we have significant potential for upsell and cross-sell within our existing client base. For example, in addition to the significant new client wins towards the end of the third quarter and the one we announced yesterday. The team recently closed a deal to expand an existing eValuator relationship with the addition of our prophy module, a testament not only to our growth team, but also the value that client success can have. We also have several late-stage discussions with existing clients to become the first enterprise user of both our flagship solutions, which has been a key corporate objective for fiscal 2023. We've also shifted our marketing focus to sales and procurement cycle in our industry has always been onerous, but in the last 12-months. It's been elongated or complicated due to macro and industry specific factors that have increasingly impacted our nation's health systems negatively. In response, we have shifted our marketing efforts to emphasize the acceleration of known prospects and developing marketing plans and collateral health specific deals at each stage of the pipeline. Clients and prospects continue to recognize the ROI we can deliver. And in many cases, we are getting better at helping them navigate their internal IT processes to help them get out of their own way. The heightened level of scrutiny on which revenue cycle projects to pursue emphasizes the need for our solutions. Health systems continue to be financially challenged and our ability to ensure they are accurately paid for the care. They provide is paramount. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Interim CFO, BJ Reeves. BJ?"", ""Thank you Ben, for the quarter ended October 31, 2023 total revenue was $6.1 million compared to $6.2 million during the prior year period. For the nine months ended October 31, 2023, total revenue was $17.2 million compared to $18.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2022. As previously reported, the company had a large professional services contract that did not renew at the end of its 2022 fiscal year. These professional services contracts are not expected to be part of the Company's core business going forward. Saas revenue grew 22% in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same prior year periods. During the previously announced nonrenewal of a legacy due to the previously announced non-renewal of a legacy client. We anticipate sequential declines of quarterly SaaS revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and first quarter of fiscal 2024, and that SaaS revenues will return to a sequential growth during the second half of fiscal 2024. Total operating expense was $19 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $9.4 million for the third quarter of 22. For the first nine months of fiscal 2023 operating expense totaled $35.8 million compared to $27.1 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2022. The higher operating expense was primarily attributable to a $10.7 million noncash impairment charge, primarily related to goodwill, not including the impairment. The lower operating expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2022 is associated with lower headcount and the integration of the Abilene and evaluator businesses. Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 net loss totaled $11.9 million compared to a loss of $3.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. For the first nine months of 2023. Net loss totaled $17.3 million compared to a loss of $9.2 million during the first nine months of 2022. The increased net loss was primarily the result of the noncash impairment charge, offset by the lower operating lower cash operating expenses on relatively static total revenues during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we generated $0.4 million of adjusted EBITDA compared to a loss of $1.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. For the first nine months of fiscal 2023, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $1.8 million compared to a loss of $3.5 million for the prior year period. The improved adjusted EBITDA as a result of the shift in the company's revenue composition in favor of high margin SaaS revenue as well as significant cost savings achieved through the fiscal 2022 strategic alignment has been mentioned. We believe that beyond $15.5 million of implemented SAP have implemented SaaS ARR, the Company will generate persistent adjusted EBITDA with significant operating leverage from that point. Currently, we expect we can achieve that run rate during the second half of fiscal 2024. Moving to the balance sheet. As of October 31, 2023, we had $2.6 million of cash on hand compared to $6.6 million at January 31, 2023. The balance of our term loan was $9.4 million, and we had drawn $0.5 million on our revolver. The Board and executive team have prioritized improving the company's liquidity position. We have a strong working relationship with our current lender, and we are exploring a number of options and working to ensure we make the right move for the business and not just the most expedient. As Tee mentioned, we expect to update you on our progress in the near term. The company's accounts receivable was $3.7 million at October 31, 2023 compared to $7.7 million as of January 31, 2023. The Company has a number of large annual receivables, which it expects will be created during the fourth fourth fiscal quarter. That concludes my review. I will now turn the call back to Ben for his closing remarks."", ""Thank you, BJ. Let me close by reiterating the confidence we have in the current and go-forward business. First, I have the privilege of talking to our clients and prospects every day they are facing staffing challenges, increased denials and complex or inefficient systems, macro and micro variables and require them to be conscientious of how they prioritize projects and investments. That's translated into current clients who are incredibly appreciative and demanding while prospects are looking for more validation due to the complexity and enormity of the problems we're solving it ironically creates both lags in timing and increased confidence that we are in exactly the right business. And second, while working with my associates through this transition, I have been incredibly inspired by their willingness to step up lean and and be creative with our new structure. There's no team I would rather put in front of our clients from the persistence of our growth team to the agility of our innovations associates to the tacrolimus and implementation to the empathy and value drive and client success. We are all motivated and aligned to help our clients get paid for the care they provide. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator?', 'Operator', 'Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Matthew Hewitt of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.', ""Good morning and thank you for taking the questions out. But maybe first up, I'd like to dig in a little bit on the environment. Obviously, it's been pretty challenging over the past year, hospitals under pressure, as you mentioned. I'm just curious, you know, as you have these daily conversations with customers and prospects, are you hearing any change in tone or to your expectations as we start to look in the new calendar year?"", 'Yeah. Thanks, Matt. To your high band one or two, take that for Matt.', ""Sure. Yes, I think that as it's become more obvious that some of the challenges are starting to be structural. So like the staffing shortages and even the relationship with with the health care insurers, it's become more clear that there needs to be longer term fixes. And they've these health systems have looked up, for example, the entire revenue cycle and done a comprehensive solution to say here's where we are strong and weak and where we need to invest. I think in the short term, there was a lot of outsourcing that was done and now they're looking for things that are going to be a little bit more sustainable. And honestly, that's where are our sweet spot is trying to drive structural revenue cycle improvements."", ""That's helpful. And then maybe separately. And maybe this is for you, Ben, obviously, given the challenges over the past year, the structural realignment and some of the other changes that you've implemented. I'm just curious with the current employees, the morale, the excitement that they bring into the office every day, how are you how is your team doing?"", ""Yeah. We have a group that got together in person last week and then a management team meeting earlier this week. And I'd say that they're they really are rising up and leaning in. I think it's allowed us to be creative and question, some of the structures we had previously, the there's no doubt that making sure that we hit for bookings targets and secure the financing is over their head and I think yesterday's announcement around the large remedy win was a huge one for us, and I think they see the path to to to move forward. Good questions."", 'Thank you.', ""Thank you. The next question is coming from Brooks O'Neil of Lake Street Capital Markets.Please go ahead"", ""Thank you, good morning, everyone. I guess I have a few questions. A follow on with Matt, in terms of trying to dig into this a little bit more, obviously, you've got at a minimum two and some might argue three, [800 pounds] gorilla. Is it in the broad marketplace. And I'm thinking most specifically about I'm Oracle, Cerner and Epic, and maybe you could just give us a sense for a couple of things related to those two. One is, you know, how willing or reasonable are they in terms of speed open to working with you guys and allowing your systems to at least interface and coexist with theirs and whether you've seen either of those two entities making any efforts to create their own products that do more or less, what are your products?"", ""Yeah, Ben why don't you go ahead, Brooks to you go ahead, but directly IT burden we have we have insights on the Oracle side, and we also have some insights on the FX out of their system doesn't do so. Go ahead, Matt."", ""Yeah, there was a an earnings call earlier this week where Oracle talked a little bit about their strategy with Cerner and what they're doing there. Obviously the fact that we have a formal relationship with them and they continue to recognize that they're not trying to build something to do. What revenue does is very reassuring. They are trying to move their clients to new accounting platforms and make a number of changes after the Oracle acquisition. We view those as entry points for us to be able to come in and we've been at their trade shows they did a sponsored webinar for us. There's a lot of good activity on that side. On the on the EPIC side, they're notoriously not as famous for signing the sets a similar agreement like the one we have with Oracle. On the flip side, they're very easy to integrate with. It's a very standardized set of data. They have some tools that, in theory would would directly compete, but the sophistication and the service level is just very different. We believe that they have a lot of runway to invest in the clinical side of their EHRs, still to make sure that physician burnout is at a minimum and that they continue to convert various health systems. So at this time, we don't think that they are we know that they're not trying to invest specifically in the space that we play, but even if they were to we have a moat around the value of our workflow rules and knew why that. And then you add on the service component where we're sitting with our clients on a monthly basis and helping them giving them the tools to succeed. So there's the technology and the insight part. They're very good at investing in the technology, and they're very focused on the clinical side. So I'm not that worried about them for the foreseeable future, especially given the pace of change within healthcare IT."", ""Thanks. Great that color was helpful for you. So let me just ask you a second question. You obviously have to primary products that you sell into into that hospital and physician world that's out there. I guess I'm curious if you envision sort of keeping these two separate or whether in your longer-term vision, you could envision a sort of product they actually that ultimately integrate and some level does the majority of the work that I hospital would be looking for from the kinases you guys offer?"", ""Yeah, that's a great question, Brooks. This Tee Green. But certainly the teams are all integrated now so there's not separate organizational structure. So that's the first step. But yes, it's a good question and one that we continue to look at as we as we move forward Ben one of to your point on on some of your thoughts there?"", ""Yes, there's a lot of really good standalone value in RFID today. I think long term, we would be able to merge the technology platforms. And if you look at eValuator is very easy to see how we could expand further into denials tracking and quality measurements in a handful of other that would just look like an additional module. The workflow that we have already has multiple teams and they're each module that you could you could add there would use the same data model, same workflow, just a different team and a different outcome. There's we have a huge effect on the rate of denials today, but we believe that there's a lot that we can do and denials are the ultimate post spill error, and we want to make sure that we manage and prevent those. I think there's a lot that we can expand into and I think making sure that our sales pipeline helps us creep into that without getting too far past our strategic core is critical."", ""Yeah okay. Let me just ask one more and I appreciate the color. So when I think about the booked SaaS ACV versus the implemented, obviously you're making some good progress there, but you still have in the range of $3 million of I guess I'd call it implemented, but sold of the business. So talk to us about sort of the timeframe, whether there's still bottlenecks there in terms of completing implementations and any other headwinds you see VERSUS, you know, nice sales traction and hopefully we can get that implemented in a timely way in 2024. But just talk to us about what's happening out there in that regard?"", ""Yes, BJ, why don't you take the first part of that on the on the actual numbers? And then Dan can can jump in on some of the timing we're seeing with our client."", ""Yes. Thanks, Tee. And thanks, Brook. So yes, as you mentioned, we are tracking to that $15.5 million number that we've mentioned and with yesterday's announcement gets us even closer on the books, SaaS ACV so that we are now closing in on having it booked and then with the implementations, we are seeing some headwinds that then we'll give some color. There is still a little bit with the staffing, but the implementations are progressing and we are seeing that the DES, those projects go forward that we mentioned that we'd see the SaaS revenue from that start to grow back in the second half of the year. So we're seeing progress there. And that's just some of the of the business challenges that they're not elaborate on that that's just slowing them down a little bit. But then do you want to jump in on the business aspect?"", ""Yes, the eValuator side seems to have largely returned to what our expectations was, but we still have trouble kicking off the projects, even though IT has budget and things like that, but we're pretty confident the couple that are in our backlog right now will be in the early part of next year. The revenue side, it has two factors. One, it's obviously just a much more complex system that you have to train individual departments. It's a it's a larger rollout. It's a harder problem that we're solving there. So we're pretty conservative in our forecasts. And even the one that we announced yesterday, we have we've pushed pretty far into 2024 just to be conservative, even though they have the client has expectations to go live a lot sooner because we're replacing a another vendor. There are some still when we're tied to a much larger upgrade within Oracle that get pushed out and may end up being much up to a year or are more kind of projects. We only have really one or two those those left. And so the remedy one should be in the middle of 2024. That's why we're targeting that EBITDA slip in the midpoint of 2024 right around there."", ""Okay. That's great Ben, I did well, I apologize, but are you seeing Oracle Cerner being battled up with their own internal integration and expansion efforts? Or do you think there? They're pretty and I'm capable of interacting with you in ways that can allow you to get to make the progress you hope to make with the business?"", ""Yeah after the initial acquisition, there definitely was a it was slower than we all would have would have liked and understanding who we were supposed to go to. It's a very large complex organization. So it took a while to figure out that for this for the community works, which are the smaller hospitals, it's a whole different, not only just the sales team, but the way that they approach those clients and the way that they deploy them for the for the larger clients, it's by this region and that so there's some getting to know you kind of stuff even though their product management team was super excited to have us in the portfolio, but it took a little bit. And obviously with the acquisition, there are people coming in and out I think now we're in a pretty good spot. So like I mentioned, they sponsored a webinar for us. They brought us to their community works for and they brought us that gives us a great spot at their Oracle Health Conference. So I do think that there's there's momentum and as we think we mentioned last quarter that we have had three through that channel. And we have a list of clients that were specifically targeting to convert the it's a lot easier when they're pushing us sort of stand-alone VERSUS if they're trying to roll out an entire patient accounting system at 10 facilities for larger ACV. Don't get me wrong. And so it'll be great, but it is a lot more complicated process they bring in outside consultants to help with that implementation. It's more hands in the cookie jar substantially more complex than that. The one that I mentioned that is still much later in 2024 that's tied to an Oracle project. That's the reason is there's large implementation teams and many moving parts."", ""Okay. That's great color. I'm excited about what you guys are doing and I'm pretty sure we're going to see better results in 2024. So keeping."", 'Thanks, Brook.', 'Operator', ""Thank you.

That's why Yum! Brands aims to be part of the solution and is working with suppliers to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."", '""We rely on healthy agriculture systems to support sustainable crop yields and livestock productivity,"" said Yum! Chief Sustainability Officer Jon Hixson. ""If temperatures rise and extreme weather events increase, then there may be less supply of items like beef, chicken and cheese worldwide. It\'s all connected. Improving supply chain resilience helps mitigate these risks, benefiting our consumers, suppliers and franchisees.""', 'In 2021, Yum! Brands announced science-based targets (SBTs) and established a clearly-defined path to reduce its GHG emissions intensity from core proteins, which include beef, chicken and dairy, by 46% by 2030, compared to its 2019 baseline, in line with the Paris Agreement goals.', 'In order to reach these goals, Yum! is partnering with its protein suppliers, investing in targeted pilots, engaging with sector and industry partners from land use to animal feed, and working across the food industry to ensure transparency and alignment with how agricultural emissions are being tracked and reported.', 'Tapping into technology to make dairy more sustainable', ""United States dairy farmers have worked hard to reduce their GHG emissions, so much that the U.S. dairy industry is responsible for less than 2% of the nation's total carbon output."", ""Their expertise is evident in the Dairy Farmers of America's (DFA) partnership with Pizza Hut U.S. In 2022, Pizza Hut set a goal to source 50% of the dairy used to make its pizza cheese from farmers focused on using sustainable practices by 2025 and met the goal two years early."", 'Now the brand is focused on helping those dairy farmers become even more sustainable by providing them with a SCiO cup. Farmers place a scoop of cattle feed into the cup to determine levels of dry matter in the feed, delivering precise nutrition to the cows. As a result, the cows eat less feed but consume more nutrients, resulting in less methane released, causing an overall GHG emissions reduction.', '""This DFA partnership provides dairy farmers with technology that makes feeding cows more efficient and reduces environmental impacts while still delivering the same great taste our customers have come to expect,"" said Emily True, the global sustainability manager at Pizza Hut. ""The technology is so effective that we\'re applying it to markets around the world.""', 'Investing in sustainable agricultural practices', 'Native grasslands make up a critical component of the U.S. beef supply chain; they also generate many important ecosystem services, including helping with carbon storage, supporting water retention and providing habitats for fish and wildlife. But these systems are adversely affected by climate change, land use conversion, overgrazing and the spread of invasive species.', 'To address these environmental impacts, Taco Bell and long-time supplier Cargill are jointly committing $2 million and will leverage up to an additional $2 million in funds from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to provide grants to U.S. beef producers in the Intermountain West via the Rocky Mountain Rangelands Program. The first round of grant recipients have already been identified for their impactful restoration and regenerative ranching work.', '""In partnership with Cargill, Taco Bell will help organizations working directly with ranchers to provide a better habitat for wildlife, increasing carbon sequestration and creating a more resilient ecosystem for people and for the species that depend on these rangelands for their very survival,"" said Jeff Trandahl, executive director and CEO of NFWF.', 'Combatting biodiversity loss', 'Another way the protein supply chain contributes to climate change is when forests are cleared to grow crops or raise animals, like in the Amazon and other areas of South America, which then releases carbon. As soy is a key ingredient in poultry feed, KFC is committed to being part of the solution with its Western Europe market aiming to source 100% of its soy sustainably by 2030 (2025 for KFC U.K. & Ireland). Plus, the brand has already incorporated a soy sourcing policy into its Sourcing Code of Practice, conducting a soy mapping exercise, engaging with suppliers on sustainability programs and sharing progress and challenges through disclosure.', '""Delivering finger lickin\' good chicken to our fans is important, as is ensuring that KFC does so responsibly. Soy raised in areas known for higher risks of deforestation is a topic we continue to focus on to mitigate our impact on climate and biodiversity,"" said Aurélie Dufour, head of Responsible Sourcing & Regulatory Compliance in KFC Western Europe. ""Tracking soy used across the poultry supply chain is complicated, but we are committed to preventing deforestation with the help of our suppliers and trusted NGO partners.""', 'Engaging suppliers about climate action', ""Beyond the targeted engagements, Yum! knows how important it is to engage its suppliers more broadly when it comes to climate action. That's why the company joined the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (LOCT) in 2022. Suppliers that participate in the program receive education and training on the climate landscape, measurement and reporting, and abatement. The goal is that participating suppliers will make impactful changes in how they operate, ultimately benefitting the climate, but also, their bottom line."", '""This is hard work and takes a real commitment,"" said Ann Davidsons, director of Energy, Sustainability & Infrastructure at Guidehouse, the global consultancy firm that manages the Supplier LOCT. ""Our experience is proving that, with access to hands-on education and practical tools, suppliers can make a measurable impact in a more rapid fashion.""', 'Looking ahead at decarbonization in food systems', 'Collaborating with suppliers and sharing key learnings across its global business will remain integral as Yum! continues its climate journey. This includes areas that are still in development like how to track and calculate emissions in food systems which can vary by commodity and supplier.', '""Our brands remain committed to making their supply chains more sustainable whether it be by reducing emissions or investing in more sustainable agriculture practices,"" said Hixson. ""While there\'s still a lot of work to be done, our cross-sector collaborations are helping identify new innovations and providing space to test what works before we look to scale solutions more broadly.""', ""For more information about Yum!'s Recipe for Good Growth, click here."", 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum!

That makes sense since higher yields make investments like CDs more competitive for income-oriented investors.', ""Interest rates also impact the cost of capital for REITs. But the property markets have adjusted to rising rates before, and investor worries are likely to be overblown if you have a long-term investment horizon. This is why you might want to jump on industry-leading REITs like Realty Income (NYSE: O), Prologis (NYSE: PLD), and AvalonBay Communities (NYSE: AVB) while there's still time (their stock prices are already starting to recover)."", ""Realty Income's market cap is roughly $39 billion, which is about three times larger than its next-closest peer. Add in an investment-grade-rated balance sheet, and Realty Income's size is a material competitive advantage."", ""Realty Income can more easily sell stock and debt to raise capital, which keeps its costs low when it's buying new assets. It also has the scale to make massive acquisitions that smaller peers couldn't even consider, including buying up smaller competitors."", 'Realty Income has increased its dividend annually for 29 consecutive years, and its dividend yield is roughly 5.7% today. That yield is near the highest levels over the past decade, which suggests that the stock is attractively priced right now. In fact, the last time the yield was this high was during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.', 'The portfolio is heavily focused on retail properties (nearly 80% of rents), and the REIT has a growing portfolio of European assets that add geographic diversification to its portfolio (this is fairly unique in the net lease sector). More conservative investors will probably find Realty Income quite appealing.', 'With a market cap of $110 billion, Prologis is even bigger than Realty Income. That said, it operates exclusively in the industrial sector, with a massive portfolio of warehouses.', 'It is almost hard to fathom the size here, with Prologis owning 1.2 billion square feet of warehouse space across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. The REIT is focused on owning assets in key transportation regions, making it something of a one-stop shop for large customers looking to build a reliable supply chain. Like Realty Income, Prologis has the heft to be an industry consolidator.', ""The dividend yield is a modest 2.9%, but that happens to be toward the high end of the yield range over the past decade. It's probably not as attractively priced as Realty Income, but there's a nuance here. Realty Income's dividend has grown at a roughly 3.8% compound rate over the past 10 years, while Prologis' dividend has grown at 11% annually over that span (with increases in each of the past 10 years). In other words, dividend growth investors might want to take a look at Prologis today."", ""AvalonBay is one of the largest apartment landlords you can buy, with a market cap of about $25 billion. The company's claim to fame is really its ability to shift between buying, building, and selling properties to maximize shareholder value over time."", 'The end goal is to ensure that money is being spent in the most advantageous way, given the prevailing market conditions. So far, AvalonBay has proven quite adept at changing with the world around it while keeping its portfolio modern and well-located (largely in and around major U.S. cities).', ""AvalonBay's dividend yield is 3.7%. Like the other two REITs mentioned here, that's toward the high end of the range over the past decade. One notable difference for AvalonBay, however, is that the dividend hasn't been increased every year even though it has trended steadily higher over time. If you can look past that relatively minor difference, the necessity value of apartments, combined with the REIT's size and strong operating history, make AvalonBay an attractive investment choice."", ""While Realty Income, Prologis, and AvalonBay are all around 30% or so below their highs reached in 2022, they have all begun rising off of their recent lows. In other words, Wall Street might be getting more comfortable with the fact that rising interest rates aren't a fatal blow to any of these REITs. And if that's the case, you'll probably want to act sooner rather than later, because waiting too long to buy these industry-leading REITs could mean missing the opportunity completely."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

The Fed officials have held the benchmark rate steady, a move that was widely anticipated. But what was more encouraging was the signal from the Fed that it is done with rate hikes this time around and forecasting three rate cuts for next year. The dot plot further indicates another four rate cuts in 2025, lowering the rate by a full percentage point.These rate-cut projections bring REITs to the forefront. The FTSE NAREIT U.S. Real Estate Index for all equity REITs gained 3.71% yesterday. There were increases across all asset types, with office, industrial and retail categories registering decent gains.Notably, almost all REIT stocks, big or small and from different asset categories, including Prologis PLD, Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. ARE, The Macerich Company MAC and Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. IIPR, moved higher.REITs’ dependence on debt for business keeps investors optimistic about their performances in a rate-cut environment as the companies benefit from lower borrowing costs. Moreover, low interest rates contribute to higher valuations. Also, their dividend yield grabs investors’ attention more than yields on fixed-income and money market accounts in times like these.Specifically, the Fed officials’ median projections for the federal funds rate by the end of December 2024 is 4.6%, down from the 5.1% stated earlier, suggesting the comfort of the Fed officials with the easing of the inflation rate and the economy holding on well. With a full percentage point decline expected in 2025 and another spate of reductions in 2026, the median projection for the federal funds rate by the end of December 2026 is pegged at 2.9%, which is close to the long-run outlook.The revised outlook also indicates reduced inflation for the current and upcoming years, with the Fed's preferred price index increasing 2.4% in 2024, excluding food and energy.Moreover, the projections for the U.S. GDP growth rate have been upgraded to 2.6% from the 2.1% stated in September. While the GDP is expected to grow 1.4% in 2024, close to the 1.5% mentioned earlier, the projections for unemployment have been unchanged.There are pockets of strength amid this scenario, with the REIT industry offering a real-estate structure for several economic activities — real or virtual. Investors should keep a close watch on the REIT stocks to grab solid opportunities in this special hybrid asset class.Presently, Innovative Industrial Properties carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Prologis, Alexandria Real Estate and Macerich carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

Seagate Technology Holdings lost money last year, so the fact that it's paying a dividend is certainly disconcerting. There might be a good reason for this, but we'd want to look into it further before getting comfortable. Considering the lack of profitability, we also need to check if the company generated enough cash flow to cover the dividend payment. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. The company paid out 102% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses.

Today, investment bank Oppenheimer is going BofA four better, raising its price target to $168 per share, as The Fly just reported. What\'s more, whereas BofA assigns UPS stock only a ""neutral"" rating, Oppenheimer thinks the stock will ""outperform.""', 'UPS has apparently been making the rounds on Wall Street lately, with both investment banks citing separate ""investor meetings"" with the company as prompting their price target revisions.', 'Last week, BofA\'s takeaway from its meeting is that UPS is off to a ""solid"" start to peak shipping season this year -- but that UPS seems to be trending toward the low end of its forecasted 3% to 8% volume growth in Q4 2023. The banker responded by cutting its estimate of earnings growth at UPS by 2% in both 2023 and 2024, raising its price target but keeping its rating at neutral.', 'Oppenheimer is a bit more optimistic, thinking that UPS is both increasing shipping volumes and also winning back customers it lost during the period of uncertainty when UPS was negotiating with its union, and the Teamsters were threatening to strike.

The analyst added that it sees UPS making progress on optimizing ""network flow"" and cutting costs, which might help to stabilize the company\'s profit margin.', ""It remains to be seen how big those margin improvements will be, however, or whether they will be good enough to justify UPS's current valuation of 16 times earnings, as well as earnings trending lower."", ""On the plus side, 3% or 4% volume growth, plus a dividend yield of 4.1%, get UPS about halfway to justifying the stock's modest 16x P/E ratio.

In 2019, for example, UPS scored a 6% net profit margin, which more than doubled to 13% in 2021, and has only fallen back to about 9% at last report, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence."", ""Falling margins mean that 2023 will probably mark a near-term nadir in UPS's profits -- as much as 36% below 2022 levels. Granted, higher revenue growth may counteract weak margins going forward. But even so, most analysts don't see UPS returning to 2022 levels of profitability until 2028 at the earliest."", 'Long story short: Valuing UPS stock on a level of earnings that it\'s unlikely to be ""earning"" again for several years is a strategy likely to turn the stock into a value trap for investors.

And before I start, I'm just a heads up for everyone that I'm trying to get over a cost. And I apologize in advance if some if I start to cough, it becomes a nuisance. I'll just have Ron finish the call. So first and foremost, thanks for joining us this evening. During our fiscal fourth quarter and through today, the Company continued to make significant strides in our objectives relating to commercial progress, product development and regulatory clearances. I would first like to discuss what I believe is the Company's most significant accomplishment in our history, and that is FDA clearance of our one RF ablation system, which is the first FDA-cleared system that has obtained an indication for both recording electrical activity and ablation of nervous tissue utilizing the same device.I mentioned last quarter that we had submitted a five 10 K application to the FDA. This past June, the FDA responded to the submission with questions that we responded to last month. We were confident in our responses to FDA and this past Monday, we announced that the FDA provided a five 10 K clearance for the system for the creation of radiofrequency lesions and nervous tissue for functional neurosurgical procedures. We anticipate the commercial launch in the first half of 2024. Currently, we are waiting for hardware components for the RF generators. Once they are available, we will release the product for commercialization We remain in discussions with two strategic organizations regarding their interest in licensing the technology for these procedures and expect to reach a decision in the near future and also remain open to commercializing the device directly, if excuse me, if we believe it presents the best option for the Company. In addition, the Company is exploring other applications for the system to treat pain. We believe there are additional market opportunities. We may be able to take advantage of with the system, and we'll provide further updates regarding this in the future.We are extremely excited with this major accomplishment and continue to demonstrate the company's ability to execute on our strategic plan. We believe that the addition of the system to our profit product offering positions us well to compete not only for the ablation business, but also for the SEG. electrode sales opportunity.I'd now like to provide an update regarding the expanded launch of our Evo SEG. electrodes electrode product line with our commercialization partner, Zimmer Biomet. In our fourth fiscal quarter, Zimmer continued to strategically open new centers. Feedback remains consistently positive.Regarding the device performance and we are seeing increasing usage in recent months. We expect to see continued ramp in device sales and revenue as the launch expands further and believe that the clearance of our one RF ablation system will also have an additional potential positive impact on the EVOSEG. sales.Moving on to our drug delivery program, you might recall that I discussed the potential for SEG. electrode technology to offer the ability to deliver genes or drugs to the brain as well as record the therapy's impact during the past quarter, we defined the product requirements for use in both clinical and research developed prototypes for future studies and were granted a patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We are currently in contract discussions with a biotech company regarding their interest in using our device and their upcoming clinical studies and have discussions scheduled with other potential partners as well. We are excited with the prospects of this technology and how it may assist the biopharma biotech industry in their drug or gene therapy delivery development, but also its value clinically and current neurosurgical procedures. If we are able to reach an agreement with our existing contract negotiations, excuse me, that technology has the potential to add revenue later in calendar year 2024.Regarding our development efforts with our spinal cord stimulation program to treat chronic back pain, members of our Physician Advisory Board successfully placed a nine millimeter paddle electrode paddle electrodes are very similar in concept to cortical or film electrodes, but they were able to place nine millimeter paddle electrodes utilizing a percutaneous placement approach and a cadaver model. In addition, we completed a histological analysis of a 28 day implanted paddle electrodes. Without any notable concerns excuse me, spinal cord stimulation and pain management remain a priority for the company given the market opportunity and potential competitive advantages of our technology.Thank you for your time. And now I'd like to turn it over to Ron for a more in-depth review of our fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 financial results, highlighting highlighting revenue gains, past financing and other key financial metrics. Ron?"", ""Thank you, Dave. Product revenue was $742,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and $1,952,000 for the full fiscal year compared to a product revenue of about $69,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 and $171,000 for the full fiscal year 2022. The company had no collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 and $1.45 million for the full fiscal year 2023 compared to collaboration revenue last year of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter and just slightly below $1.950 million for the full year of fiscal 2022. Collaboration revenue was derived from the Zimmer development agreement and represents the portion of the exclusivity and milestone fee payments we're eligible for revenue recognition during the respective periods.Our total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 were $3.4 million compared with $3.3 million in the same period of the prior year. R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 were $1.8 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period of the prior year. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 were $1.6 million compared with $1.9 million in the prior year period. Total operating expenses for the full fiscal year of 2023 were $13.9 million compared with $11.9 million in the prior fiscal year.R&D expenses for the full fiscal year of 2023 was $6.9 million compared with $4.9 million in fiscal 2022. SG&A expenses for the full fiscal year of 2023 were $6.9 million compared with $7 million in the prior fiscal year. Our net loss was $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to a net loss of $1.4 million in the prior-year period. For the full year, net loss was $11.9 million for fiscal '23 compared to a net loss of $10 million in fiscal 2022.On July 27, 2023, the company consummated an underwritten public offering of its common stock for $6 million in gross proceeds from which the Company received $5.2 million in net proceeds. In addition, the company sold common stock under the ATM program at an average price of $1.77 per share, from which the company received net proceeds of $2.5 million as of September 30, 2023. At the end of our fiscal year, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $5.3 million compared to $11.1 million as of September 30, 2022. We had working capital of $5.5 million at September 30, 2023, compared to working capital of $9.1 million as of September 30, 2022, company had no outstanding debt as of September 30, 2023 or 2022.With that, I will turn it back to Dave."", 'Thanks, Ron. Operator, at this time, I think we can open up the call for questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Ben Haynor, Alliance Global Partners.', ""Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the FDA clearance of First off for me. Just regarding the commercialization with it's you guys are through a partner. I was just curious on how you have kind of scoped out what sort of sales force and activities that might be needed if you do choose to go it alone."", ""Sure. I'll take that and thanks for the question, Ben. Good to hear from you on what we see now is that when you look at the number of centers that are really doing the bulk of these procedures. It's about 50 centers on the upper end. And when you look at what's reasonable in terms of a sales rep or distributor and in terms of how many accounts they can handle, probably five and if you're pushing that six. So this isn't a situation like many technologies where you have thousands of hospitals that are licensed to do the procedure in the U.S., it's only about 100 to roughly about 190, and it's kind of the old 80 20 rule, 80% of the procedures are being done at 20% of the centers. So we think with a combination of distributors and we've already had distributors express interest on working with us to distribute this product and a handful of direct people that we could effectively call on those top 50 centers. And what we're going to do then as well is we would obviously focus on the centers that are already using the product that have already converted to the product and start there because those are kind of the low hanging fruit there already believers and Tom, adding the ablation procedure would really be a no-brainer.Okay."", ""That makes sense. And I imagine it will be to a huge number of people but a half a dozen sounds a fairly reasonable. And then I'm just curious on any feedback that you received from folks who clinicians and such, Al now that you are following the FDA clearance?"", ""Yes, the feedback is one, can we get a system, which is which is a nice problem to have. So there's been really for the last since since we submitted to FDA for building enthusiasm from the field. And what's been happening is in the cases that we've been supporting them with our Zimmer Partners and physicians will bring up the fact that they're very interested in using the device for ablations and when will the device be available and what's the rollout plan and things like that. So and now that it's gotten cleared. I mean, literally the on Monday, the day we put out the announcement, I had e-mails from physicians from our advisory board neurosurgeons, who were who were already wondering when they were going to be able to get the system. So and so it's exciting for me because this this obviously has been in the works for a while, and I kind of see the interest in the momentum build from Keno. I I'm I'm pretty excited to get this product out into the field. I think it's going to do very well."", ""Okay. That's helpful. And so what have you been telling them on when they can get that system?"", ""First half for the March to April, May February ended the problem is whenever you make a whenever you throw a date out to physicians, well, really to anybody, then that becomes the expectation. And when that doesn't happen, there's a lot of people disappointed. So what we told physicians is that we're waiting for parts to come in as for the generators. Those parts from a schedule perspective are due in March, but these are parts that had about a 10 to 12-month lead time. So we would have these quite a while ago, and we're completely dependent on the vendor to get those parts in. And as we all know now, the reliability of some vendors is not just during COVID, but after it has been challenging.Now the good news is this company has been pretty consistent on when they feel they can deliver. But until until our vendor that's making the boxes for us has those parts in hand, we're going to continue to say in the first half of the year. We're confident confident doing that. But if we can expedite those time lines by three months, four months when those units first become available, the product will be available for commercialization. We will not delay. So I'm hopeful we get them in when when they say. But we've we've certainly all been burned before on commitments from vendors when parts are coming in and that is 100%. So the devices that we're actually manufacturing ourselves, the assemblies, the electrodes, we have full confidence and you know that we can launch this product in in January, February, but it's just the generator parts, a few of them that we're waiting on.Okay."", ""That's understandable and Fair enough. And then lastly, for me just on drug delivery, what are the clinical trials that the firm that you're in contact with now I would presume their earlier stage trials. I mean, is that accurate and then with the folks that you're scheduled to talk to or are talking to at some point, what's kind of the right way to think about what sort of stage these trials might be at?"", ""Yes.So it would be very difficult for a company that has done a Phase one Phase two, but without our device to then kind of incorporate that in that would be, in my mind, a significant change to their protocol. So it would be very, very unlikely that any of those companies would want to change their protocol because it brings added risk to the FDA have had this happen personally in other companies where if something goes wrong, then the FDA, the question is, is it your product or is it this new technology that you introduced. And so these would all be Phase one studies that we're talking about, but they haven't started yet. The protocols are being developed, but the studies with the company that we're talking to are expected to start late Q3, early Q4, Tom and the areas that they're looking to evaluate with our technology. And this has been really consistent with other companies that we're speaking to now, it's been for epilepsy, which is kind of a slam dunk, given that that's where our procedures are being done today. Parkinson's is another one. And then one that was a little bit surprising to me was some ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. So that one, we still need to learn a little bit more about how they would want to use our device. And it may be the cortical or the strip electrodes versus the SEG. for that type of procedure."", ""Okay.That's helpful. That's all I had, gentlemen, thanks for taking the questions.Thanks a lot."", 'Sure.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to management for any closing."", 'Yes. Thanks, operator. I just wanted to close with that. We really believe the Company has made extraordinary progress towards the goals that we actually set for fiscal 2023. And just to remind everyone of just a handful of these, we received FDA clearance actually on our SEG. electrode during fiscal 2023. We commercially launched that line in May with Zimmer Biomet, our distribution partner, we submitted for FDA clearance on our one RF ablation system. Obviously, subsequently received FDA clearance for that product as well. In addition, we did raise capital with existing and for me, even more importantly, new institutional investors without including warrants, we launched the drug delivery program and continued to make progress regarding our implantable electrode intended to treat back pain. I also believe the company has the potential to add revenue in 2024 beyond SEG. sales with contributions coming from our ablation system and potentially our drug delivery partnership or partnerships.In closing, I hope you all continue to follow our exciting progress. Thank you and have a good evening.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 18% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.92 total annually to $0.88. Payments have been decreasing at a very slow pace in this time period. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. It's encouraging to see that Pentair has been growing its earnings per share at 14% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time."", 'Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year.

In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$172b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$172b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$94b', 'The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$136b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$70.7, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.', ""We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mondelez International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.', 'Weakness', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', 'Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn\'t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.

GIS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.5%, on average.', 'General Mills’ commitment toward its three priorities as part of its Accelerate strategy is likely to have aided in the quarter under review.

Our model suggests price/mix to be up 3.8% in the second quarter.Notably, General Mills’ North America Foodservice business has been performing well, gaining from high consumer traffic in hospitality, travel, education, and other non-restaurant away-from-home food channels. We expect segment sales to increase 3.5% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.That said, the company’s Pet segment retail sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were somewhat affected by pet parents’ shift toward value products and channels, along with smaller pack sizes. Additionally, the company has been witnessing challenges in the wet food and treats categories, with pet parents spending more time at work or away from home. Management expects the difficult category dynamics to persist in the Pet segment throughout fiscal 2024 as it does not see any major change in economic viewpoint for pet parents in the near term. This raises concerns about the quarter under review as well.Apart from this, General Mills input cost inflation has been moderating. On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that the biggest factors impacting its performance in fiscal 2024 are likely to be consumers’ economic status, the moderating rate of cost inflation and the rising stability of supply-chain status.

The Oracle of Omaha, as he's affably known, has overseen a nearly 20% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) since taking the CEO role in the mid-1960s. On an aggregate basis, we're talking about a gain of 4,355,584%, as of the closing bell on Dec. 8."", ""When you double up the annualized total return of the benchmark S&P 500 over nearly 60 years, you're going to get noticed. It's why professional and everyday investors closely monitor Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13F filings to uncover which stocks the Oracle of Omaha and his team of investors have been buying and selling."", ""As we prepare to close the curtain on 2023 in roughly two weeks, it's readily apparent that one highly regarded stock is a virtual lock to be purchased by Warren Buffett throughout 2024."", ""A quick look at Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs over the past couple of years reveal some popular names that Buffett and his investing lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have piled into."", ""Tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is an ideal example of a great business that Buffett and his aides have the utmost faith in. Apple accounts for nearly half of Berkshire's $365.5 billion investment portfolio."", 'Since opening a position in Apple during the first quarter of 2016, Buffett and his team have added to their stake on numerous occasions. In fact, Buffett stated during Berkshire\'s annual shareholder meeting in May that Apple is ""a better business than any we own."" It\'s an incredibly strong statement, given that Berkshire owns well-regarded insurer GEICO and highly successful railroad BNSF, among roughly five dozen other businesses.', ""Buffett's belief that Apple is Berkshire's best business likely has to do with the company's innovation-driven operating model. It's consistently No. 1 in U.S. smartphone market share, and it has a loyal base of consumers that were drawn in by its physical products (iPhone, Mac, and iPad). To boot, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a natural evolution of the company's operating model that will have Apple focused on higher-margin subscription services."", 'The Oracle of Omaha is also, undoubtedly, a huge fan of Apple\'s capital-return program. The largest publicly traded company by market cap in the U.S. is returning $15 billion a year to shareholders via its dividend, and it\'s repurchased more than $600 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. These buybacks are increasing Berkshire\'s stake in Apple without Buffett or his ""lieutenants"" having to lift a finger.', ""Another familiar name Warren Buffett and his team have been piling into is energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Since the start of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway has added more than 228 million common shares of Occidental. This is on top of the $10 billion in preferred stock in Occidental (yielding 8%) Buffett's company received in 2019."", ""Having close to $13 billion invested in Occidental common stock is a pretty clear indication that Buffett and his closest investing confidants believe the spot price of oil will remain elevated or head even higher. Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine, along with multiple years of reduced capital investment by energy majors because of the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to tight oil supply worldwide. Anytime the supply of a major commodity is constrained, there's a good likelihood the price of said commodity will increase."", ""What's noteworthy about Occidental Petroleum compared to other integrated oil and gas operators is that it generates most of its revenue from its drilling operations. This is to say that its operating performance is considerably more sensitive to changes in the spot price of crude oil than other integrated energy companies. If the spot price of crude oil remains high, Occidental will disproportionately benefit from it."", 'Over the past two years, Apple and Occidental Petroleum have been regularly purchased stocks for Buffett and his team. But if I had to wager on which stock is likeliest to be bought by Warren Buffett in 2024, neither of these two companies would top the list.', ""Interestingly enough, the stock Warren Buffett is virtually guaranteed to buy in 2024 isn't going to be found on Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13Fs. Instead, you'll find evidence of these purchases toward the tail end of the company's quarterly operating results. That's right -- the company that's a practical lock to be bought by Buffett in 2024 is... Berkshire Hathaway."", ""Prior to July 17, 2018, Berkshire Hathaway had a share repurchase policy in place that only allowed for buybacks if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above stated book value). At no point for well over a half-decade prior to this date did Berkshire Hathaway's stock reach this threshold. As a result, Buffett was never able to pull the trigger on any buybacks."", ""On July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board passed new measures that allowed its dynamic duo -- Warren Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger -- to get off the proverbial bench and repurchase their company's stock more frequently. In order for buybacks to take place:"", 'Berkshire Hathaway needed to have at least $30 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet; and', ""Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger needed to agree that Berkshire's stock was intrinsically cheap."", ""Admittedly, I'm not entirely certain who, if anyone, will step in and play the sidekick role to Warren Buffett when it comes to share repurchases moving forward. What I do know is that the Oracle of Omaha has overseen the repurchase of more than $72 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock since July 2018. Further, Buffett has bought back his own company's stock for 21 consecutive quarters, through September 2023."", ""As of the end of the most recent quarter, Berkshire's cash position ballooned to an all-time record $157.2 billion. With little in the way of value tickling the fancy of Buffett, Weschler, or Combs, it's a virtual guarantee that at least some of this cash will be deployed to repurchase Berkshire's common stock in 2024."", ""To add, Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend. The way Buffett regularly rewards his long-term shareholders is through buybacks. Reducing the number of outstanding shares over time should increase the ownership stakes of Berkshire's shareholders, much in the same way that Apple's buyback program has grown Berkshire's stake in the company."", 'Furthermore, reducing the outstanding share count of a company with steady or growing net income can increase earnings per share (EPS) over time. This helps Berkshire Hathaway become even more fundamentally attractive to value-seeking investors.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

The company's GF Score stands at 75/100, indicating a potential for above-average performance. However, its GF Value Rank is at a lower 3/10, suggesting that the stock may not be undervalued at its current price."", ""Comparing Occidental Petroleum's current stock price to its GF Value, the stock is trading at a 1.17 ratio, indicating it is modestly overvalued. The stock has seen a 920.14% increase since its IPO and a year-to-date price change of -3.75%. The recent trade by Buffett has resulted in a 4.63% gain in the stock's price, showcasing the market's positive reaction to his investment decision."", ""Buffett is not the only guru invested in Occidental Petroleum. Other notable investors include Dodge & Cox, Smead Value Fund (Trades, Portfolio), and Prem Watsa (Trades, Portfolio). However, Berkshire Hathaway remains the largest guru shareholder, with a significant portion of the company's shares."", ""Buffett's top holdings predominantly lie in the technology and financial services sectors, yet his investment in Occidental Petroleum underscores a strategic position within the oil & gas industry. This move comes at a time when the energy sector is experiencing market volatility and a global shift towards renewable resources, highlighting Buffett's knack for identifying value even in traditionally cyclical industries."", ""Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s latest transaction in Occidental Petroleum Corp reflects a strategic enhancement of his portfolio in the energy sector. The trade's impact on both the stock and Buffett's holdings is significant, reinforcing his position as a major investor in the company.

SCD patients report health-related quality of life scores well below the general population and significant health care resource utilization. SCD affects the red blood cells, which are essential for carrying oxygen to all organs and tissues of the body. SCD causes severe pain, organ damage and shortened life span due to misshapen or ""sickled"" red blood cells. The clinical hallmark of SCD is vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), which are caused by blockages of blood vessels by sickled red blood cells and result in severe and debilitating pain that can happen anywhere in the body at any time. SCD requires lifelong treatment and significant use of health care resources, and ultimately results in reduced life expectancy, decreased quality of life and reduced lifetime earnings and productivity. In Europe, the mean age of death for patients living with SCD is around 40 years. Stem cell transplant from a matched donor is a curative option but is only available to a small fraction of people living with SCD because of the lack of available donors.', 'About Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia (TDT)', 'TDT is a serious, life-threatening genetic disease. TDT patients report health-related quality of life scores below the general population and significant health care resource utilization. TDT requires frequent blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy throughout a person’s life. Due to anemia, patients living with TDT may experience fatigue and shortness of breath, and infants may develop failure to thrive, jaundice and feeding problems. Complications of TDT can also include an enlarged spleen, liver and/or heart, misshapen bones and delayed puberty. TDT requires lifelong treatment and significant use of health care resources, and ultimately results in reduced life expectancy, decreased quality of life and reduced lifetime earnings and productivity. In Europe, the mean age of death for patients living with TDT is 50-55 years. Stem cell transplant from a matched donor is a curative option but is only available to a small fraction of people living with TDT because of the lack of available donors.', 'About CASGEVY™ (exagamglogene autotemcel [exa-cel])', 'CASGEVY™ is a non-viral, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy for eligible patients with SCD or TDT, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are edited at the erythroid specific enhancer region of the BCL11A gene through a precise double-strand break. This edit results in the production of high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is the form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth. CASGEVY has been shown to reduce or eliminate VOCs for patients with SCD and alleviate transfusion requirements for patients with TDT.', 'The use of CASGEVY in the European Union remains investigational.', 'CASGEVY is approved in the U.S. to treat people aged 12 years and older with SCD who have recurrent VOCs.

CASGEVY is currently under review by the Saudi Food and Drug Authority for both SCD and TDT and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for TDT.', 'About Conditional Marketing Authorizations (CMAs)', 'CMAs are for medicines that fulfil a significant unmet medical need such as being for serious and life-threatening diseases, where no satisfactory treatment methods are available or where the medicine offers a major therapeutic advantage.

Having more HbF increases overall hemoglobin levels and has been shown to improve the production and function of red blood cells. This can eliminate VOCs in people with SCD.', 'IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION', 'What is the most important information I should know about CASGEVY?After treatment with CASGEVY, you will have fewer blood cells for a while until CASGEVY takes hold (engrafts) into your bone marrow.

You should discuss options for fertility preservation with your healthcare provider before treatment.', 'STEP 1: Before CASGEVY treatment, a doctor will give you a mobilization medicine. This medicine moves blood stem cells from your bone marrow into the blood stream. The blood stem cells are then collected in a machine that separates the different blood cells (this is called apheresis). This entire process may happen more than once. Each time, it can take up to one week.', 'During this step, rescue cells are also collected and stored at the hospital. These are your existing blood stem cells and are kept untreated just in case there is a problem in the treatment process. If CASGEVY cannot be given after the conditioning medicine, or if the modified blood stem cells do not take hold (engraft) in the body, these rescue cells will be given back to you. If you are given rescue cells, you will not have any treatment benefit from CASGEVY.', 'STEP 2: After they are collected, your blood stem cells will be sent to the manufacturing site where they are used to make CASGEVY. It may take up to 6 months from the time your cells are collected to manufacture and test CASGEVY before it is sent back to your healthcare provider.', 'STEP 3: Shortly before your stem cell transplant, your healthcare provider will give you a conditioning medicine for a few days in hospital. This will prepare you for treatment by clearing cells from the bone marrow, so they can be replaced with the modified cells in CASGEVY. After you are given this medicine, your blood cell levels will fall to very low levels. You will stay in the hospital for this step and remain in the hospital until after the infusion with CASGEVY.', 'STEP 4: One or more vials of CASGEVY will be given into a vein (intravenous infusion) over a short period of time.', 'After the CASGEVY infusion, you will stay in hospital so that your healthcare provider can closely monitor your recovery.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Casgevy (developed as exa-cel) for sickle cell disease (SCD) and will consider it for beta thalassemia early next year. A few weeks earlier, U.K. regulators authorized the therapy for both blood disorders."", ""This represents CRISPR Therapeutics' first commercialized product, meaning revenue growth is just ahead. Since the U.S. approval, though, the company's shares have slipped, falling a little more than 4%. With its first major product approval behind it, has CRISPR Therapeutics said goodbye to its biggest share-performance catalyst, or could this biotech player gain over the long term? Let's find out if the shares are a buy after the company's landmark win."", ""First, a bit of background on the company and its exciting new product. CRISPR Therapeutics is a specialist in gene editing, or the repair of faulty genes responsible for disease. The company uses a technique inspired by the way some bacteria protect themselves from viruses. It's called CRISPR, short for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats of genetic information."", 'CRISPR gene editing involves the cutting of DNA at a particular location, allowing a natural repair process to happen.', 'The company uses this technique throughout its pipeline, so a nod from regulatory agencies is a vote of confidence in this innovative technology.', ""CRISPR Therapeutics partnered with big biotech Vertex Pharmaceuticals on Casgevy. Vertex has taken on 60% of the program's expenses but also keeps 60% of profit. This is a good deal for the smaller company as it allows it to benefit from Vertex's commercial expertise -- Vertex already markets billions of dollars of cystic fibrosis drugs annually -- and minimize its costs. At the same time, even a 40% share of profit could be big for CRISPR Therapeutics as Casgevy has the potential to become a blockbuster."", 'Today, treatments for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia are limited, and Casgevy is designed as a one-time curative therapy. So, in spite of the complex treatment procedure, involving blood stem cell collection and a chemotherapy phase, patients and doctors may flock to this new option. Today, about 16,000 patients are eligible for the treatment, according to CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex.', ""Revenue growth won't happen overnight though, as the treatment procedure takes a period of months, so it will take time to recruit patients and launch their therapies. The companies are also working with payers regarding reimbursements for the treatment, which carries a list price of $2.2 million."", ""Now, let's take a look at CRISPR Therapeutics' stock. The shares have climbed about 50% this year on anticipation of the regulatory win, but they remain considerably lower than their peak\xa0when there was much less visibility on future revenue. Even if the shares don't return to that high point, revenue growth ahead should offer them a significant lift over time."", ""Let's consider our question: Is CRISPR Therapeutics a buy after its big win? It's true the approval may have been baked in to today's share price, but the future revenue potential isn't. And this revenue, when it starts and as it grows, could represent an ongoing catalyst for the stock. It's also important to remember that CRISPR Therapeutics has a pipeline of candidates based on the same gene-editing technology. Any progress there could also support share performance."", ""So CRISPR Therapeutics' share price and growth catalysts are far from over. The stock may not soar from here overnight, but that's OK. Long-term investors are likely thinking of potential over at least five years, and from that perspective, CRISPR Therapeutics looks like an excellent buy right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

Three stocks that are big names within their respective industries and that can make for excellent long-term investments are UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). These businesses have excellent track records, they pay their shareholders dividends, and their futures remain bright."", ""Healthcare and insurance are two relatively safe places of the economy for investors to focus on. There's an ongoing need for both of those services and one company that gives you the best of both worlds is health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group. It has also made for a fantastic growth stock, having doubled in a span of just five years."", ""At a market capitalization of around $500 billion, it's one of the most valuable healthcare companies in the world. The company doesn't have the greatest bottom line as it has averaged a profit margin of just 6% over the trailing 12 months. But UnitedHealth generates over $300 billion in revenue on an annual basis, which means that at a 6% margin, it can still generate more than $18 billion in profit each year. Over the past four quarters, its earnings have been higher than that, at $21.7 billion."", 'UnitedHealth is also always on the hunt to get bigger. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to acquire home health company Amedisys for $3.3 billion. That builds off its $5.4 billion acquisition of another home health business, LHC Group. With a plethora of profits and cash coming through its business, UnitedHealth is in excellent shape to continue growing and expanding via acquisitions in the long run.', ""Investors also have plenty of incentive to hold on to the stock as UnitedHealth pays a dividend that yields 1.4%. And while that may seem modest, it's deceptively low as the company has an excellent track record for dividend growth. "", ""UnitedHealth is one of the safest healthcare stocks investors can own, and it's a no-brainer if you want an investment that you don't want to worry about."", ""Soft drink giant Coca-Cola doesn't need much of an introduction. Go into any grocery store or restaurant within the country and there's a good chance you'll find one of its products either being served or available for purchase. The simplicity of its business is what makes it appealing to long-term investors such as Warren Buffett; Coca-Cola is among the top holdings in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio."", ""Coca-Cola earns great margins on its products. In the past 12 months, the company's profit margin has been just under one-quarter of the top line. The business has been resilient, even in the midst of rising costs. Its low-priced products make it easier for Coca-Cola to raise prices without making them appear too expensive. "", 'The company has been able to adapt to changing consumer trends over the years, such as launching healthier products and drinks with no sugar. That ability to evolve is an important one for long-term investors to consider, which is why the business is a solid one to hang on to for years.

And the stock is a Dividend King, making it highly probable that the dividend income you earn from the stock will increase over time.', ""Another big name for investors to consider is Oracle. The brand has become synonymous with databases but it's also much more than that. These days, it's also focusing on the rising popularity of artificial intelligence (AI). Chief Technology Officer and Chairman Larry Ellison stated earlier this year that the company was spending billions of dollars on AI chips from Nvidia as it aims to grow its cloud computing business. "", ""Oracle's strong profit margins in excess of 18% put it in a great position to pump more money into AI so that it can take advantage of what's proving to be a hot trend not just in tech, but in other industries as well, with companies looking for ways to make their operations more efficient. The company pays a dividend yield of 1.4% but it's not getting in the way of growth; Oracle's payout ratio is around 43% of profits. That leaves plenty of room for the company to invest back into its growth opportunities."", 'Shares of Oracle are up more than 40% this year, but with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of just over 20, the stock is trading in line with the S&P 500 average.

Dividend stocks provide truly passive cash flow in the form of quarterly or annual payments that often increase with each passing year. Income investors can also use those regular payments to supercharge overall returns if they choose to automatically reinvest them. That way, you can accumulate more shares during market downturns and fewer shares when stocks are rallying."", ""Many dividend stocks have climbed higher in the past year, partly thanks to those appealing qualities. But several still seem like attractive options for income investors. Let's look at a few reasons to like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO)\xa0today."", ""Don't let Apple's relatively modest dividend yield scare you away from this excellent stock. Sure, the roughly $4 per share in total quarterly payments translates into just a 0.5% yield based on today's stock price. But Apple maintains one of the market's biggest capital return programs. In the past year, the tech giant has sent $15 billion to shareholders through dividend payments in addition to nearly $80 billion of stock buyback spending."", 'Those figures illustrate how Apple prefers to allocate more of its excess cash toward stock repurchases. But its dividend is still a priority for executives and has been increasing steadily since 2012.', ""There are plenty of reasons to expect more growth in 2024 and beyond.\xa0Apple reported modest sales gains last quarter thanks to robust demand in the core iPhone business. The tech giant's services division is expanding nicely, too, which is a great sign for long-term profitability."", 'The best part is that investors can hold this tech stock and watch those profit margins rise while they collect cash returns both from stock buybacks and its rising dividend.', 'Coca-Cola has been a passive income giant for decades. Its dividend dates to the 1890s, in fact. And that payout has been rising annually for the past 61 years.', ""But there's more to be excited about in Coke's future as well. The company is growing sales at a double-digit rate today, for one. The sales spike is coming from a healthy mix between higher volumes and increased prices. Consumers still like core brands such as Coke Zero, and they're also enthusiastic about non-traditional beverages like sparkling waters, energy drinks, and teas."", ""You'll struggle to find a more financially impressive business than this. Coke's operating profit is sitting at an industry-leading 30% of sales, giving management plenty of resources it can direct toward growth initiatives like the company's massive marketing program."", ""Its flood of cash flow supports a rising dividend that's currently yielding more than 3%. Investors can thank pessimism on Wall Street around Coke's short-term growth prospects for that higher yield. The stock dropped 6% in 2023 even though its earnings trends have strengthened this year."", 'As a result, you can buy shares of Coke for 2024 at a relative discount of 24 times earnings.\xa0Investors were paying nearly 30 times earnings in early 2023. It might take time before Wall Street wises up to that obvious value, but patient income investors can just collect its rock-solid dividend in the meantime.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

With this in mind, two well-known consumer stocks might be on your radar.', ""I'm talking about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), which readers have undoubtedly heard of. There are compelling reasons to want either of these businesses in your portfolio. But which of these top Warren Buffett stocks is the better buy right now? "", ""Apple sells some of the most in-demand products and services on the planet, and it enjoys extreme customer loyalty. However, it's the ecosystem that it built between all of its hardware and software that really makes this business special. Customers pay higher prices for its devices, and then get locked in thanks to all the services Apple offers, and how well they integrate across those devices. This gives it a huge competitive advantage."", 'To be fair, Apple has hit a rough patch recently. Its revenue declined 2.8% in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept. 30). Macro uncertainty, mainly around higher interest rates and inflationary pressures, might be discouraging shoppers from spending on discretionary items.', 'But this is still one of the most financially sound enterprises out there, providing a level of safety and security that not many stocks can offer investors. Apple produced $100 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2023, the vast majority of which it used to repurchase shares. This boosts earnings per share, something that Buffett certainly appreciates.', ""Coca-Cola's defining trait is its incredible brand strength. The company sells its products in more than 200 different countries across the globe -- an unbelievably wide reach that makes it recognizable to people everywhere. Plus, Coca-Cola's consistency is something that consumers can rely on, especially for a low-cost product like soft drinks."", ""This brand advantage has benefited the company by allowing it to flex its pricing power. In the third quarter, Coca-Cola's sales were up 8% year over year. Management also highlighted that pricing was up 9%, a key reason for the healthy top-line gain. Due to strong momentum, executives raised their full-year guidance for both revenue and earnings."", ""Coca-Cola is a mature business, so it isn't going to register outsized growth like many tech stocks, but its stability and durability could be intriguing for some investors. The company boasts a stellar operating margin of 27.4%, which supports a\xa0 dividend that at current share prices yields 3.1%."", ""There's no doubt that both Apple and Coca-Cola are outstanding businesses. The main reasons being that they possess some of the strongest consumer brands in the world and have excellent profitability, which helps explain why they are large holdings in the portfolio of Buffett's conglomerate."", ""There isn't much disparity between these two companies when it comes to their earnings growth outlooks. The consensus analyst estimate is that the beverage maker's earnings per share are expected to grow at an annualized clip of 10.3% in the next five years, about the same rate as is forecast for Apple."", ""Valuation could be more a meaningful metric to differentiate between them. Coca-Cola shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of under 24 right now, a sizable discount to Apple's 32. It's worth noting that Apple stock's 50% gain in 2023 is all attributable to investors deeming it worthy of a higher multiple."", ""Apple gets a lot of attention for good reasons. It's the world's most valuable company, sells one of the most successful tech products in history in the iPhone, and is ingrained in millions of people's day-to-day lives. But its shares are expensive enough that some investors might view buying stock in Coca-Cola as a better choice."", ""However, Apple has been the better investment by far over the past one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods. Its valuation is steep, for sure, but I think it's a better stock to own than Coca-Cola."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

Markets have remained under pressure due to uncertainty caused by higher interest rates. While many believe we are still not out of the woods, the Fed’s acknowledgement that its efforts against inflation are working and its readiness to take a dovish stance is enough to soothe investors’ nerves in the short term.', 'But will stocks keep rebounding in 2024? Will socks rise after the Fed actually starts to cut interest rates? An interesting report from LPL Research takes a look at the behavior of equities during interest rate cuts. The report said that while assessing or predicting stock movements driven by interest rate cuts, it’s extremely important to pay attention to where we actually are in the business cycle. For example, the report said that when the Fed began to cut rates after series of hikes in January 2001 and September 2007, the economy entered recessions. However, rate cuts of 1984, 1987, 1989, 1995, and 1998 saw the S&P 500 significantly rise over the next six to 12 months.', 'A report by Meeder Investment Management takes an interesting look at the effect of rate cuts on stocks and whether it makes sense to be overly bullish on stocks on expectations of rate cuts next year.', '""One common perception among investors is that the stock market will perform well once the Fed starts cutting interest rates. History tells us this is not necessarily always the case. In fact, over the past nine initial interest rate cuts, more than half of the Fed’s first cuts were followed by declines in the S&P 500 Index ranging from -22.6% to -55.5%. The Technology bubble in the early 2000s and the Great Financial Crisis proved to be the worst scenarios, with the Fed cutting interest rates at two different times during the secular bear market of 2000–2009. On the other hand, four of the nine occurrences were followed by minimal weakness and achieved strong 6-month returns. On balance, over the past nine initial interest rate cuts, the S&P 500 Index had an average decline of -20.5% and an average 6-month return of 3.4%. So while the market has experienced both bull markets and bear markets following the first rate cut, history does not indicate that the Fed’s accommodative policy will simply carry the market higher. Valuations matter too. When the market had a decline of at least -20% after the Fed’s first cut, the average S&P 500 trailing PE ratio was 18. On the other hand, when the S&P 500 had a decline of less than -10%, the average PE ratio was 11.4. The current P/E ratio of 22 could be another reason to be more cautious once the Fed makes its first cut.""', 'Risky stocks were ruthlessly shunned by investors when the inflation storm forced the Fed to take a hawkish stance. The market was more gravitated towards safe stocks like Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and Kroger Co (NYSE:KR). But as investors begin to look towards the era of rate cuts and monetary ease, small companies might see a rebound in investor interest in the coming weeks and months.

In addition to clocking in better-than-expected quarters, these software plays stand to benefit greatly from artificial intelligence (AI) and its productivity-enhancing effects in the workplace.', 'Undoubtedly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the enterprise software kingpin that’s shown us all how to effectively turn cutting-edge AI tech into profits. In 2024, I’d look for other enterprise software players, like INTU, NOW, and MNDY, to take a page from its AI playbook. And that entails more than merely “sprinkling” a bit of AI across various software platforms. It may change how workers use enterprise applications to get jobs done faster and more accurately.', 'It’s an exciting time to be an investor and an even more exciting time to be in enterprise stocks while they’re still viewed favorably by the Wall Street community. Therefore, let’s check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to see where the previously mentioned trio of workplace software stocks stand going into the new year.', 'Intuit is quickly becoming one of my favorite workplace software companies to benefit from AI’s rise. The company behind hit accounting software Quickbooks and its more mature TurboTax tax-preparation software has been staying innovative to protect its corner of the software market.', 'The stock has been soaring since bottoming out late last year. Year-to-date, it’s up a whopping 52%, thanks in part to strong recent quarters (the latest quarter saw adjusted earnings per share of $2.47 vs. the $1.98 consensus) and hopes for AI-driven growth in the near future.', 'Undoubtedly, Intuit already has a relationship with a slew of small businesses out there. As it improves its platform and looks to empower its users to do more with less with the help of AI, I view Intuit’s QuickBooks platform as one of those indispensable value-adding software platforms poised for impressive growth. For this reason, I’m staying bullish on the stock alongside the Wall Street crowd.', 'Furthermore, Intuit seems closer to turning AI innovation into actual cash flows, at least closer than some other firms out there that are merely “dabbling” with the technology. Tax preparation and accounting seem like fields that could be vastly improved with the help of AI.', 'One of the new AI features coming to its tax offering is AI analysis of one’s return. Tax lingo can be tough for many to deal with. With some AI, it’s suddenly crystal clear. That’s a big deal — one that leads me to believe that the 37.2 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), roughly in line with the application software industry average of 36, is not high enough.', 'Intuit stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 16 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average INTU stock price target\xa0of $623.82 implies 3.8% upside potential.', 'ServiceNow is another powerful enterprise software company that’s been on a hot run of late, now up 76.5% year-to-date and 102% off its lows of last year, to hit a new all-time high of over $720 just yesterday. Solid quarterly results and increased enthusiasm over the company’s role in the AI race are big reasons many analysts have been in a hurry to upgrade the stock. I stand with analysts and am staying bullish on shares heading into 2024.', 'Most recently, UBS Securities hiked NOW stock’s price target to $820 from $650. Why the huge hike? UBS analysts are factoring in the company’s Pro+ AI SKU into its financial models, and it sees the technology playing a larger role in the growth story, moving forward. Indeed, UBS is right on the money. Enterprise software (or ITSM in the case of ServiceNow) plus cutting-edge AI tech seem like the perfect formula for growth.', 'Going into 2024, we’ll gain a glimpse of just how much of an impact AI can have on ServiceNow’s fundamentals. I have a feeling UBS may need to upgrade its target again in the new year as the company looks to unleash the power of its platform.', 'Of all the enterprise tech firms embracing AI, ServiceNow may be the one that does it best. Even near highs and a now-lofty 56.5 times forward price-to-earnings multiple, I still don’t think the stock is absurdly valued in the slightest.', 'NOW stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 28 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average NOW stock price target\xa0of $681.62 implies that shares are fairly valued at the moment.', 'Last but not least, we have Monday.com, a workplace project management platform that’s starting to pick up traction after getting clobbered severely during its 2021-22 sell-off, which saw shares shed more than 78% from peak to trough.', 'So far this year, the stock is up 59%, a minor rally relative to the implosion in the rear-view mirror. After increasing its full-year outlook and winning some fans from the analyst community, it seems that the Israel-based enterprise tech firm is ready to continue its recovery in the new year. Given this, I find it hard not to be bullish.', 'For the full year, Monday.com expects 2023 sales in the $723-725 million range, up from $713 million. Also, adjusted operating income is now expected to be in the $47-49 million ballpark, up from $24-28 million. That’s quite a hefty jump on the bottom line.', 'Last month, DA Davidson upgraded shares to Buy, also remarking on the “geopolitical risk” of the Israeli firm. With “strong cash generation,” as outlined by DA Davidson, and a modest multiple, Monday.com stock certainly seems like one of the workplace software plays to keep watch of in the new year as we look for AI innovation to take center stage.', 'MNDY stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 13 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average MNDY stock price target\xa0of $211.21 implies 10.7% upside potential.', 'Enterprise software stocks are full of potential going into the new year as they look to turn AI innovation into real cash flows. Of the trio of names presented in this piece, Monday.com holds the most upside potential (10.7%). At this juncture, I think it’s the best buy of the batch.', 'Disclosure']"

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. (See link below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings.)', 'The ratings reflect UnitedHealthcare’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strong, as well as its very strong operating performance, very favorable business profile and very strong enterprise risk management.', 'The rating upgrades for Chesapeake Life are based on its strategic importance as a writer of UnitedHealthcare branded ancillary products.', 'The rating affirmations of UnitedHealthcare reflect its continued favorable balance sheet and operating performance trends. The company’s risk-adjusted capitalization is at the very strong level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Consistent capital and surplus growth, driven by favorable net earnings, generally has outpaced premium growth driving increased risk-adjusted capitalization. AM Best anticipates that this ratio will moderate in the near term based on tighter management of statutory capital and growth in higher risk charge business, mostly Medicare Advantage. At the same time, while not fully captured in risk-adjusted capital metrics, UnitedHealthcare’s overall underwriting risk has trended downward as the organization has increased its value-based and capitation arrangements under which a growing amount of risk is shared with providers.', 'UnitedHealthcare’s invested assets are held predominantly in investment grade fixed income securities and cash/cash equivalents. There is no material exposure to equities, real estate or Schedule BA assets. The company’s investment portfolio is quite liquid and has relatively low risk. Operating performance is very strong with a consistent trend of premium and earnings growth. Premium growth is driven by enrollment gains in most lines of business. The company’s Medicaid membership is contracting with state redeterminations of eligibility driving declines offsetting growth from new contracts. Net earnings are mostly driven by the favorable underwriting results. Although investment income is positive, it contributes modestly to overall net earnings. UnitedHealthcare’s operating earnings benefit from its large membership and the economies of scale it provides the organization on both medical expenditures and administrative expenses. UnitedHealthcare is focused on medical cost reduction through targeted direction of care to low cost, high quality providers, as well as an expansion of home care and virtual care options where appropriate.', 'UnitedHealthcare maintains solid market shares by line of business and geography.

The company has a solid equity position despite significant use of capital for return to shareholder and merger & acquisition (M&A) activity. Financial leverage is managed at approximately 40% on a long-term basis with a tolerance to exceed this for strategic M&A with the expectation of moderation of this metric over time. Earnings before interest and tax coverage have remained strong at about 14 times. Ample liquidity is supported by operating cash flows, parent company cash, an active commercial paper program and an $18 billion revolving credit facility. Nevertheless, there is a large amount of goodwill and intangibles on the balance sheet totaling approximately 130% of equity. There have been no material impairments and acquired assets historically have contributed favorably to earnings.', 'UnitedHealth Group’s favorable balance sheet and operating trends are sustainable. The company has demonstrated a history of attaining solid growth in both revenues and earnings annually. The company has significant scale and is well-diversified between business segments in its insurance operations as well as within its non-regulated Optum healthcare service businesses. Business development and retention are supported by the organization’s focus on innovation around member experience, operations, product design, provider reimbursement, care management and health-related services with an emphasis on the use of technology and data analytics. Due to its geographic diversity of operations and segmented customer base, UnitedHealth Group has no undue reliance on any single market, customer or health-care provider. However, similar to industry trends, the share of revenue and earnings from government programs has increased materially over the years.

A fiscal tightening by the Federal Reserve to tackle soaring prices also led to recession fears. The United States economy, however, weathered these storms to emerge stronger than ever. Analysts are now predicting a major boom for stocks.

The stocks of these three companies are up by 58%, 56%, and 50% this year. After a 12% plunge in 2022, the benchmark S&P 500 is likely to end 2023 with 14% in gains.\xa0', 'This optimism is riding on recent statements from the Federal Reserve that indicate that rate cuts will begin next year. On December 14, Fed chief Jerome Powell said that the Fed was done raising rates as inflation cooled. Stocks rallied and bond yield shrunk after that statement, with analysts jacking up their price forecasts for the coming months. The Fed is expected to make three quarter point cuts to the benchmark interest rates next year. These rates had been at their highest level since 2001 after record inflation in 2022.\xa0', 'Not everybody is convinced about the emerging trends. In late November, prominent investment firm JPMorgan released a gloomy forecast for 2024. In a transition year for the economy, the investment bank predicted that the benchmark S&P 500 would drop to around 4,200 by the end of 2024. The bank identified shrinking global growth and household savings, rising geopolitical risks, and elections in the United States that could add to policy volatility as some of the prime reasons behind this pessimistic forecast.\xa0', 'The position of JPMorgan stands in contrast to others on Wall Street. In addition to Yardeni, famous firms like Bank of America and Deutsche Bank have also backed the S&P 500 to touch record highs next year. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also constructive on the index, with David Kostin at the former and Mike Wilson at the latter both predicting that the index will come close to the previous peak in the next few months. The average analyst estimate for the index for 2024 sits at around 4,664, per Bloomberg.\xa0', 'Investors eager to get on top of these growth trends should have a listen to recent remarks by Sundar Pichai, the CEO of tech firm Alphabet Inc.

Pichai highlighted the market opportunity offered by the rapid evolution of products and services in the artificial intelligence domain and urged investors to focus on strides being made in countries like India and Japan.

(NYSE:DHI) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine D.R. Horton’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.', ' View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton ', ""The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that D.R. Horton’s ratio of 10.75x is trading in-line with its industry peers’ ratio, which means if you buy D.R. Horton today, you’d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since D.R. Horton’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market."", ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 6.6% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for D.R. Horton, at least in the short term."", 'Are you a shareholder? DHI’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at DHI? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DHI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

The recent decision by the Federal Reserve to keep key interest rates steady is a positive signal for the homebuilding sector, offering a breath of fresh air amid economic uncertainties. With the inflation rate showing signs of easing and the economy holding its ground, the Federal Open Market Committee\'s unanimous vote to maintain the benchmark in a targeted range between 5.25% and 5.5% provides stability for homebuilders.Policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee, anticipating further economic developments, have not only decided to hold the current interest rates but have also hinted at potential rate cuts in the coming year. The committee members expect at least three rate cuts in 2024.The committee\'s graphical representation of individual members\' expectations, known as the ""dot plot,"" suggests an anticipated four additional rate cuts in 2025. Further, three more reductions projected for 2026 would potentially lower the fed funds rate to a range of 2%-2.25%, approaching the long-term outlook and providing a more optimistic outlook for the housing market compared to earlier indications.These advancements unfold against an improving backdrop of the inflation scenario. The Consumer Price Index, a key indicator, rose 0.1% in November, and was up 3.1% from a year ago, the Labor Department reported on Dec 12. Fed officials project a gradual decline in core inflation over the next few years, reaching the 2% target by 2026. This paints a brighter picture of the overall economic landscape and, in particular, the housing market.', 'Homebuilders have been quick to adapt to the evolving market conditions. One significant strategy employed by many is offering mortgage rate buydowns, where builders cover upfront costs to lower loan rates. This approach not only attracts potential buyers but also aligns with the current low-rate environment, further fueling the demand for new homes.Meanwhile, large public homebuilders, benefiting from their scale and capital advantages, continue to thrive, particularly in entry-level price points and urban fringe markets. The ability to build spec houses, even in the absence of a confirmed buyer, underscores the resilience of these industry giants.Despite the challenges posed by high labor and land costs, homebuilders remain optimistic about expansion. Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL, a leading player in the market, has outlined plans to grow its communities by approximately 10% in 2024. The aim is to be well-prepared with inventory when a potential drop in rates coincides with the spring selling season, showcasing strategic foresight amid market fluctuations.', ""As we look ahead to 2024, the housing market stands on a more solid foundation, supported by the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates and its optimistic outlook on economic indicators. Homebuilders, armed with strategic moves and a keen eye on market dynamics, are poised to navigate challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities, creating a promising horizon for the industry in the coming year.Various homebuilding companies have been registering gains from the positive momentum of the industry. Notable among them are Dream Finders Homes, Inc. DFH, Lennar Corporation LEN, Toll Brothers and D.R. Horton DHI."", 'Investors’ decision to keep a close eye on some homebuilding stocks seems to be a judicious move at this point, given solid demand and an improving macro scenario.Dream Finders Homes: This Jacksonville, FL-based company’s land-light operating model and strategic position in high-growth markets, providing affordable homes to entry-level, first and second-time move-up homebuyers, are tailwinds. Also, the build-for-rent platform provides a consistent home deliveries pipeline, which is less susceptible to temporary changes in demand from individual homebuyers.DFH — a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock — has rallied 186.9% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 65.2% jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings has been upwardly revised to $2.62 from $2.61 over the past 30 days. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average being 131.6%.Lennar: Based in Miami, FL, Lennar is engaged in homebuilding and financial services in the United States. The company is reaping the rewards of its digital marketing efforts and a flexible pricing approach. Additionally, its strategy of minimizing land holdings and implementing efficient cost-saving methods has been advantageous.LEN — a Zacks Rank #2 stock — has gained 59.9% in the past year. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2024 have increased to $14.89 per share from $14.65 over the past seven days. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 19.3%.

Also, the emphasis on affordable luxury communities and its build-to-order model bodes well.TOL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have rallied 91% in the past year. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2024 have increased to $12.13 per share from $12.09 over the past 30 days. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 29.4%.D.R. Horton: Based in Texas, this homebuilder enjoys one of the broadest geographic diversities in the industry and is not dependent on any particular market. With 82,917 homes closed during the 12 months ended Sep 30, 2023, D.R. Horton has positioned itself as one of the largest homebuilders in the United States.D.R. Horton — a Zacks Rank #3 stock — has jumped 64.8% in the past year. DHI has seen an upward estimate revision for fiscal 2024 EPS to $14.18 from $14.02, over the past 60 days.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PepsiCo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

GPS is well-poised to tap the positive trends in the fashion world, thanks to its robust strategic initiatives including the Power Plan 2023 Strategy. The company is gaining from brand strength and the solid demand for its products that resonate well with customers. It remains committed to creating a trend-right merchandise assortment, deepening relations with customers via marketing, enhancing the digital commerce agenda and efficiently controlling expenses. Management is encouraged by the improved performance at Old Navy and its namesake label and expects a longer recovery time for Athleta and Banana Republic.Buoyed by such strengths, shares of this clothing and accessories retailer have surged a whopping 89.6% compared with the industry’s 12.6% growth in the three-month time frame. A Value Score of A further adds strength to this current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPS fiscal 2023’s earnings per share is pegged at $1.15, reflecting an increase of 387.5% year over year. This highlights analysts’ confidence in the stock.', 'Gap has been aggressively undertaking cost-management actions. It has been making efforts to simplify and optimize its operating model and structure, including increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve the quality and speed of decision-making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across its brands. The company is focused on actioning more than $550 million as annualized cost savings, realizing margin expansion on lower air costs, improved discounting and effective sourcing strategies.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Gap is on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores. Further, it expects to leverage its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs,\xa0 fueled by its scaled operations. Through the plan, the company expects to deliver consistent sales growth, margin expansion and strong operating cash flow.The company expects to open 15 to 20 Old Navy and Athleta stores and close 50 Gap and Banana Republic stores in fiscal 2023. This is in sync with its plan to close 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by the end of fiscal 2023. With the closing of underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, the company expects to realize $100 million in EBITDA savings on an annualized basis by the end of the current fiscal year. As part of the plan, the company expects the Old Navy and Athleta brands to contribute about 70% of sales by fiscal 2023.Markedly, Gap has been gaining from lower airfreight and improved promotional activity for a while now. This has been aiding the company’s margins and, in turn, the overall profitability. During third-quarter fiscal 2023, the gross margin expanded 390 basis points (bps) year over year on a reported basis and 260 bps on an adjusted basis. Merchandise margin increased 340 bps on 180 bps of leveraged commodity costs and lower air utilization, as well as 160 bps of improved promotional activity from better inventory position and robust assortments. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin increased 290 bps to 6.8%, driven by an improved gross margin and adjusted SG&A leverage. Adjusted SG&A expenses also declined 7% year over year stemming from the organizational changes and other cost-control efforts.Going ahead, management expects the gross margin to expand in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This will be backed by merchandise margin expansion of 280 bps stemming from lower commodity costs and reduced air utilization. It anticipates promotional levels to be roughly in line year over year. For fiscal 2023, Gap expects gross margin expansion versus an adjusted gross margin of 35% in fiscal 2022, buoyed by an estimated 200 bps of leveraged airfreight and about 170 bps of leveraged promotional activity stemming from lower inventories and better assortments.Given all the positives, Gap stock seems to deserve a place in your investment portfolio.', 'We have highlighted three other top-ranked stocks, namely Abercrombie & Fitch ANF, Hibbett HIBB and American Eagle AEO.Abercrombie & Fitch, a leading casual apparel retailer, currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1.
