A. CCU, Owens Corning OC and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB.', 'Price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is essentially the ratio of stock price to book value, i.e., how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the book value per share.', 'In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.', 'While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.', ""Here's the formula for P/B ratio:"", 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company, Unum Group, Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S. A., Owens Corning and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', ""There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities."", ""It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value."", 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', ""But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock."", 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Here are five of the 10 picks that qualified the screening:', ""Headquartered in Detroit, General Motors is one of the world's largest automakers.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", ""Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ', 'As you can see below, Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$35.0b of debt, at December 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$8.08b, its net debt is less, at about US$26.9b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$14.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$37.9b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$8.08b in cash and US$9.66b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$34.1b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""Since publicly traded Thermo Fisher Scientific shares are worth a very impressive total of US$218.1b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Thermo Fisher Scientific's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.5 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 14.9 times, makes us even more comfortable. The bad news is that Thermo Fisher Scientific saw its EBIT decline by 14% over the last year. If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Thermo Fisher Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time.

You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by the aforementioned Jim Gillies. Jim, thanks for being here."", ""Jim Gillies: Thanks, Ricky for that intro. Let's indeed ask me those questions."", ""Ricky Mulvey: The story this morning that is unavoidable is the Capital One wants Discover. There will be questions among US regulators because headlines are acting like this is a done deal. Let's set the terms out first though. It's a $35 billion all-stock deal. The combo would surpass JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup by credit card volume according to Bloomberg. First and foremost, why does Capital One want this business?"", ""Jim Gillies: Well, they want it. The famous or infamous word, I guess would be scale. Discover is the smallest of the four US major global payment networks, so they're about to get bigger. They want to leverage the investments, they being Capital One, leverages the investments and their network they've put down for the last decades, and they can do that by getting larger very quickly with as you say an all-stock deal. They are claiming and you should always look at these claims with a very healthy shaker of salt, let's put it that way. They're claiming there will be strong returns on invested capital, post-deal synergies totaling about $2.7 billion, I think, through 2027, or it'll take until 2027 to fully realize that. But I think the Empire building is a thing, Ricky, and this is Capital One taking the next step on building their position to challenge the folks, as you mentioned, like JPMorgan and Citigroup."", ""Ricky Mulvey: But the shareholders of Capital One aren't too happy about it, even with these advertised synergies and scale building, they're going to get access to essentially a payment network that they didn't have before, where they had to go out to Visa and MasterCard to get their credit cards out there, and yet they don't seem too happy about it."", ""Jim Gillies: Well, last I saw it was down what one or 2%, Capital One. They're reacting a little bit, or some people are reacting and say, we want to get out of the way of this. I think that's a little silly. Capital One is not richly valued right now. Frankly, I think let's put, it looks pretty decent. I think Discovery is also similarly reasonably valued. Stock Advisor Canada has a recommendation on Discover Financial, for example, and the analyst covering that, Buck Hartzell, is very enthused about the company. I don't think he's terribly thrilled about it going away. It's a scale building, these types of acquisitions do happen all the time, which I suppose is a nice little softball to you to ask about regulatory issues."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's do it."", 'Jim Gillies: There you go.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Usually you do a softball question, not a softball answer for a softball question. But all the headlines are making this sound like it's a done deal from what I've read this morning, and then there's a little bottom paragraph where it's like it still has some regulatory hurdles to clear. There's a lot of big mergers that have been falling apart lately, and it seems like those watching this story, those invested in Discover, like Buck Hartzell, maybe he still has some hope that this could be a stand-alone company."", ""Jim Gillies: On the subject of regulatory approvals or not, look in a world where Amazon buying iRobot can fall apart because of regulatory concerns, admittedly, that was the European Union who were saying, Amazon's going to delist all their rival vacuum folks on their platform and that will hurt iRobot, which is a little silly. But whatever. I have to think that Capital One and Discover who jointly released the press release today, the CEO of Discover is widely quoted in the press release. Three members of the Discover Financial board are going to be joining Capital One board. I would like to think basic due diligence has had both parties run this up the flagpole in terms of legal and probably regulatory expert folks. Now, my take on this is look, again, Discover is the smallest of the big four. Visa, MasterCard, Amex, all much larger than Discover. On the banking side, which is more where Capital One is held."", ""Capital One is like number 10 in the US in terms of total deposits, Discover is at 26. The deal will move them to about number six in the US after of course, the big four, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and I think US Bank is number five. This would move them up to number six, but they'd still be one-third in terms of deposit base. They'd be one-third the size of Citigroup and Wells Fargo, less than one-third, actually. If you prevent this on an anti-competitive basis, you're sending a second message."", ""The second message is the big four are all that matter, and we will block anyone coming to any semblance of scale with the big four. I think that actually would send a worst method. Now it doesn't mean that it won't get regulatory scrutiny, and they might have to hive off one or two things to make it sure. But I think it's not the same, obviously, but Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard, where there was some concerns about that going on there. I think this will take longer than is expected, but I think it will ultimately get done. But that two bucks buys you coffee down the street. What do I know?"", 'Ricky Mulvey: Two bucks at the Capital One cafe.', 'Jim Gillies: There you go.', ""Ricky Mulvey: You get a coffee and do your banking. Let's go to Home Depot earnings. On Friday, JMo made Home Depot radar stock. He said he was going to be curious about the inflationary story, not much of an inflationary story on the call. In fact we have disinflation, which was interestingly brought up. I think it has to do with lumber, but why is disinflation a problem for Home Depot right now?"", ""Jim Gillies: I don't think it is. Disinflation is just a slowing of the rate of inflation. It's not deflation. Disinflation is arguably what we've been doing for the past two years, trying to slow the rate of inflation. That's why we've hiked, we being the federal banks of both of our countries, hiking rates. I don't think it's that much of a problem. I think these companies like Home Depot have seen all manner of economic environments before. I think the long-term investor just looks at this and doesn't particularly care. Investing is an expectations game, and expectations, they were already set, they were going to be light. They've been light for the last year. They'd be light again this year. But you knew they were going to be light. I think I am going to go in a bit of a sermon here. I know, act shocked. Home Depot is probably one of my favorite, if not my favorite case study for a company that transitions from growth mode to cash-cow. No one noticed."", ""They noticed, but 16 years ago now. In fiscal 2008, which their fiscal year is ending in February, it's always weird. This is a company that had been in major growth mode. They've been growing their store base by somewhat like 8% a year or somewhat like that before that and 2008, they only did about two-and-a-half billion, $2.2 billion in free cash flow in that last year of growth mode, and their store count was like just over $2,200, and their capex was $3.6 billion, which is actually higher than what the most recent is. Today, the store count has gone nowhere. I think they've grown at 0.3% annually for the last 16 years, but cash flow has exploded. Home Depot is a story of a dominant company in, effectively, an oligopoly. Lowes, you can argue it's an oligopoly. Yes, there's mom-and-pop hardware stores everywhere, but whatever."", ""They've turned into cash flow mode, and the cash flow exploded. The last 16 years since they went from rapid store growth, plow all their cash flow into growing the store count to, we're just going to do maintenance, very slow growth that they're calling for 12 stores this year. They're probably going to close a couple as well, so net store growth probably won't be 12. They have produced $143 billion in free cash flow for the past 16 years. They have thrown all of it at share buybacks, which has reduced the share count by 41%, and ever-rising dividends, they've just jacked their dividend to nine dollars a share for this coming year. When they stopped their major growth trajectory, like I said in 2008, they were at $0.90 a share. They've 10-folded their dividend."", ""On a dividend-adjusted basis over the past 16 years, Home Depot, mature giant cash-cow company, has given investors 20% annualized returns. Please tell me again, though, I know there's a bunch of growth-focused investors who like to say, when this happens, it's a sign of a company maturing and all the good stuff has gone. It's been about 16 years, 20% annualized. I'm picking a straw man, obviously. But please tell me how much better the new growth changing the world has done over the 20% annualized put up for the past 16 years at poky no-growth Home Depot, who still has their competitive position unchanged by the way. I go on, I'll wait."", ""Ricky Mulvey: They offered. I want to meet this straw man who's ready to go to town on Home Depot."", ""Jim Gillies: I can give you a name or two, but we'll talk after the show."", ""Ricky Mulvey: What you just described is why Home Depot is able to essentially offer a soft forecast and the stock does not flinch. That's always the story. Earnings beat expectations, stock forecast is down and then the stock gets pummeled. Let's go to Griffon Corp, which is a story you haven't heard. It's not going to be in the headline of today's show. But we're Slacking this morning, and I offer up some stories, you give some takes on it. You wanted to talk about, and I'm quoting now, a maker of fine residential and commercial garage roll-up doors in garden rakes run by a well-comped, in-depth artistic management team."", 'Jim Gillies: Guilty as charged.', 'Ricky Mulvey: I was like, we can talk about some other things, but I feel like Jim wants to talk about this story. This is an activist story, seems like the activist plays worked out. Give us the story with Griffon Corp here.', ""Jim Gillies: Sure. Yes, Griffon Corp is that very thing. They are well-comped. One of the reasons why the activist Voss Capital showed up a couple of years ago is, do you see what these guys are getting paid basically? They pointed to a myriad of compensation plans that seem to basically need a pulse, and they'd be met in full. In fact, the pulse might be optional on a couple of them. They pointed out Voss Capital, that is pointed out that the CEO, who is a gentleman, Rob Kramer. I believe his name is the CEO and Chairman that he made more for this tiny little company. I think today it's barely a four billion dollar company. Again, they make roll-up doors, garage doors, garden rakes, garden hose. They own the Hunter Douglas fan, the old ceiling fan brand. That guy made more than the CEOs of some other companies you've heard of one, we've already talked about Home Depot, Starbucks, and Disney."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Old Bobby? Your favorite entertainment CEO, Bob Iger?', ""Jim Gillies: I was going to say, I'm going to hold off on the Bob Iger love [laughs] right now. They said the board was compromised, was full of cronies. I came to the story about a year into the activist fight. They already had one fight and they were calling for a division to be sold off. I recommended it in Hidden Gems Canada in January of 2023, and I think one market day later, they announced the deal with the activist because I was gearing up for another fight and I love a lot of good activist fight. They announced that the head of Voss Capital, who'd already got one of their directors onto the board anyway, in the previous fight, they were announcing that the the lead for Voss Capital was himself joining the board, and they announced the standstill agreement."", ""We're all going to work together and kumbaya, and we're going to bring it everything together. We're going to create shareholder value for people. They sold off the previous division, but they were in the middle of a strategic review. That strategic review disappointed everyone except apparently me when it came out a couple of months later because everyone is expecting a sale of the company. Instead, it came out that, we're going to give you two dollars a share, special dividend, and we're going to up our buyback program. Stock promptly fell from the mid 30s to the mid 20s, very nice time to add by the way. But since then they've paid that special dividend, they've hiked the regular dividend twice. They have indeed been very aggressive in operational improvements that has led to more cash flow and that cash flow is lead to better buybacks, a little bit of debt repayment."", ""They got serious about board refreshment, so they actually got rid of a couple of the directors who had been there for forever and ever. The reason I call them nepotistic as the CEO is the son-in-law of the former CEO who himself was the son of the former CEO before him. I'm not scared by that kind of stuff because frankly, I think when you have people so nakedly looking out for their own self-interest, maybe who view to align yourself with their self-interest. But the thing that came out this morning that I think is kind of the end of the activist story. So why Griffon is going forward, is going to have to earn its place in your portfolio based on performance alone, is the word came out that Voss Capital is selling 1.5 million shares to Griffon themselves at a 3% discount to the market. So that's nice, I like that. But this will take their holdings from about 2.8-2.9 million shares down by 1.5 million."", ""It'll take them below the 5% threshold where you have to report, and the lead of Voss Capital is leaving the board. Now, they gave all the right words and said we're going to keep on owning shares. However, they can now sell without needing to file a form for the rest of their holdings, so it'll be interesting. But this is a stock again, Griffon Corp, maker of garage doors and yard implements. The stock is up. Basically, it's a double over the past year. It's up about 120%, if you did take the conclusion of the strategic review as a buy signal, that's about nine months ago. If I can be said to try anything, it's, I like to preach that you can make market beating returns in odd and weird places. You don't have to go for whatever is super-hyped in in the media at this time. You can find it in Home Depot as we talked about. You can find it in people who sell stuff to Home Depot, like Griffon Corp. So I thought it was an interesting story that most Motley Fool Money listeners probably haven't heard of."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Well. I think we just hit the SMCI story with that as well, so we're about out of time, Jim Gillies. As always, appreciate your time and your insights."", 'Jim Gillies: Thank you.', ""Deidre Woollard: Deidre Woollard, co-host of Motley Fool Money, here.

The Valentine's day is over and it's time for a little heartbreak. This time, Jason and Bill shared the ones that got away."", ""Alison Southwick: Last week, Jason Moser and Bill Mann joined us in a studio to talk about the great loves of their life, by which we mean, of course, investing in stocks. But you know what, that was last week. This week, it's time to talk about the heartbreak of investing. You guys ready, I've tissues nearby if you need them."", 'Bill Mann: Valentines is over, back to cynicism. Here we go.', ""Jason Moser: We're going to power through."", 'Alison Southwick: Here we go. So our first question today is to talk about the one that got away, by which we mean a stock that you never got around to buying and wish you had.', ""Jason Moser: Yeah, there are a lot. There a lot that I can put on this list. My recency bias is going to bring Nvidia here front and center. I'll go with Nvidia because it's funny. One of my roles here, I'm the advisor for Augmented Reality and Beyond service, and when i started that service almost five years ago, Nvidia was one of the stocks I recommended. They made a lot of sense at the time and I remember digging into the company thinking, these guys are coming around and doing a lot of cool stuff. This is a stock I really probably want to own. As I mentioned before on the previous episode, we have internal trading guidelines that make it a little bit tricky sometimes for us, just people transact whenever we want."", ""So it was just never a stock that was open. It was never available for me to actually go in there and purchase, so I didn't at the time it sort of left my mind and never thought about it. Five years later, it's up like 2,000%. Now, I'm thrilled that I've got it on the card for our members because our members have clearly one big from Nvidia. That's one where I looked back and I think, man, I should've just kept that on my radar and I just didn't catch it. I wish, I did because I feel like they still got a lot to do."", ""Robert Brokamp: I'll just add a little bit about the training guidelines for people who are curious. That is, once The Motley Fool has recommended or discuss the stock, we are as employees prevented from buying it for I don't know what it is 10 days or something like that. Then also if you own it and you want to sell it, you have to check and see if we've mentioned it, recommend you can't sell it. It does limit a little bit of the investment flexibility of working here."", ""Alison Southwick: Bill, how about for you? What's the one that got away?"", ""Bill Mann: I read this assignment as something that I had recommended for members and had never gotten around to buying myself, and the answer was a company that I loved the moment that I recommended it and never went back and bought it. It was a company called TransDigm, which since that point in time, and I looked this up and it was painful to do so it's up 4,500%."", 'Robert Brokamp: Oh, goodness gracious.', ""Bill Mann: TransDigm, what they do is they make basically all of the parts inside of an airplane tube. The tube itself is Boeing or Airbus, but all of the components inside are built by other companies. By other companies, I basically mean TransDigm. They did almost everything else inside Boeing planes. It turns out when you sell those sorts of things that works out really well, and I thought it was going to work out really, really well, and it has worked out really really well for a lot of people who are not me because I didn't buy it."", ""Alison Southwick: Do you feel it's too late to ask them out?"", ""Bill Mann: It's water under the bridge at this point. It's felt expensive for the entire time and for the entire time that's been wrong. Maybe."", ""Alison Southwick: It's not in your league now maybe. What about NVIDIA? Is it too late? Can you call out to Nvidia and be like"", ""Jason Moser: Not too late as far as the business goes now. The valuation is one where I feel like, I'm going to be patient here. I'm going to be patient and let it come back to me. If she comes back to me. [laughs]"", ""Bill Mann: You're talking about the Taylor Swift of stocks, right now my friend"", ""Alison Southwick: She's moving on."", ""Bill Mann: She's on TV and you're not."", 'Alison Southwick: Next question. Tom, we actually covered this a bit last week, but tell us about the one that broke your heart by which I mean, a stock that you bought and it just went nowhere.', ""Jason Moser: This one's funny for me because it's one that really did well for a while until it just didn't. That's Under Armour. Under Armour is one that had?"", 'Bill Mann: I dated Under Armour too.', ""Jason Moser: So much potential. We saw that stretch of time where Kevin Plank really seemed to have the answer for everything and then they just hit a wall and it was self-inflicted errors. I mean, he just made some strategic blunders. I think that really sent the company into a not a death spiral, but certainly something that's been very difficult for them to recover from. Thankfully it was a smaller position. It's not something that was naturally material to my portfolio. It was one where I was considering, maybe this is one we need to keep building this out. This could be the next Nike-like story until it became apparent that it probably wasn't going to be so. To be clear, I still own those shares today. It's a small, meaningless position, but I was telling you before about I default and not selling. The funny thing is, I think Under Armour makes great stuff, I'm wearing Under Armour pants. I mean, I love them. They just can't get that business in order. It's really interesting to watch. I remember before Bill, how we would talk about Lululemon versus Under Armour. I mean, all of these."", ""Bill Mann: Nobody's talking about that anymore."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. It's just, it's fascinating to see how well Lululemon's performed while watching Under Armour just completely flounder. It's been a real lesson."", ""Alison Southwick: What's been a difference you think?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, I think certainly just vision and leadership. Leadership with Under Armour, they've just never had any kind of consistent vision as to what they wanted to do with the business and recovering from those strategic blunders that Plank made long ago and most of that was in regards to supply chain management. It's just been a difficult road for him."", ""Bill Mann: I'm still completely distracted by the fact that you used the word brodie. [laughs]"", 'Robert Brokamp: To the max even, to the max. [laughs]', ""Bill Mann: Yeah. I think it's meaningful that off the top of your head know exactly the name of the founder of Under Armour and don't know the founder of Lululemon. They have a much more professional management."", 'Jason Moser: Was that Chip Wilson?', 'Bill Mann: Yeah.', 'Jason Moser: Now Wilson is out of the picture.', 'Alison Southwick: Wilson was a bit problematic.', 'Robert Brokamp: Arguably controversial.', ""Jason Moser: I'll argue a little bit out there. I don't know that much about him, but it was very clear that there were like, look we got to part ways and get this thing back on track. Under Armour has not had that luxury because Plank is still the majority owner of that business. Split those shares out. He's controlling the whole thing. I mean, I think we could argue that's a bad move and clearly investors have loss from that."", ""Bill Mann: I'm not suggesting that Wilson was the one that got away by the way. [laughs] I am simply saying that they had a professional management team and structure in place whereas with Under Armour, Kevin Plank's basically up their Napoleon style pointing here, we go there. If you're going to be a Napoleon, you'd better bring it and he hasn't."", ""Alison Southwick: What's the stock that broke your heart, Bill?"", ""Bill Mann: Mine's Kahoot."", 'Alison Southwick: Kahoot?', 'Bill Mann: You know Kahoot. The little Kahoots, the quizzes that basically?', 'Alison Southwick: Yeah, I know Kahoot.', 'Bill Mann: Got your kids 80% of the learning they did during the pandemic.', 'Alison Southwick: Yeah, the little quizzes.', ""Bill Mann: It was a great little company and we recommended it almost when it was pre-revenue. They were building up their business, didn't even have a marketing team. It was all word of mouth and just exploding. It was one of those companies that simply and I wouldn't take the other side of this, I wouldn't want the other experience, but it was one of those companies that really took hold during the pandemic and then lost its grip on the other side. Again, I don't wish we were still in the pandemic so that Kahoot would be doing well, but it's such a company with a purpose that I really wanted it to financially succeed more than it has."", ""Alison Southwick: Our last question is for you all. Now, this was the one that got Jason squirming in his seats, so we'll see if if it's true. The one time you cheated, by which we mean an investment that generally goes against your principles or what you've recommended to readers and listeners here."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, I think the reason why I squirm is because I look at these tickers and I'm like, yeah, they're not working out and yet I still own them and I don't know why. Oftentimes, I own them because, I either I'm holding out hope that things will turn around, or they serve as living lessons and reminders. I think in this case these are reminders. One of the rules I tend to espouse, and I follow it for the most part but every once in a while I stray, is to just not buy into IPOs, give it some time. I like to see four quarters of reporting. I want to understand how this management team works. What they're focused on, how they report, metrics."", ""Every once in a while I do stray and two that standout, I'll give you two here, Eventbrite and Unity Software, a couple of companies that I bought into early on in their public lives. They just struck me as interesting businesses with a lot of potential. I didn't worry so much about the valuations and the enthusiasm behind this stuff. Because with IPOs, that can often be a drawback as the enthusiasm that's there pushes those valuations up a little bit irrationally. Especially so in the case of Unity Software, given the time that it went public, but Eventbrite and Unity stand out to me as two where I should've listened to myself. I didn't. Maybe things will get better for them, but I'm not terribly optimistic at this point."", 'Alison Southwick: Bill, how about you?', ""Bill Mann: I have a basic rule and it is this, don't leave your money at risk of dictators."", ""Alison Southwick: We're getting back to Napoleon again."", ""Bill Mann: We are getting back to Napoleon again. I have a second rule and it is if the person who is running a company seems like a bad person, they are probably a bad person. I had recommended a company called JD.com, which is a Chinese company. It's a very interesting company, a clone of Amazon.

(NYSE:NCLH) will be pleased this week, given that the stock price is up 19% to US$19.39 following its latest full-year results. Revenues were in line with forecasts, at US$8.5b, although statutory earnings per share came in 15% below what the analysts expected, at US$0.39 per share. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' 14 analysts is for revenues of US$9.28b in 2024. This reflects a solid 8.6% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to soar 174% to US$1.07. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$9.29b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.05 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$20.63, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$32.00 and the most bearish at US$14.00 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' past performance and to peers in the same industry. The analysts are definitely expecting Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' growth to accelerate, with the forecast 8.6% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 1.2% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 9.5% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$20.63, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

As you mentioned, Norwegian had a really good fourth quarter. And the guidance for the first quarter, now, there are some easy comparisons in there."", ""But for pricing, that's up mid-teens year-over-year. That's a trajectory that we won't be able to sustain.

They were on the sidelines for a good amount of that time."", ""And so for a cruise space that's historically been what they would argue is an unfair discount to land-based vacations. They then sat that out. And so they found themselves at an even wider gap relative to land-based."", ""What we've seen over the last year, year and a half is a little bit of catch-up getting back to maybe 2019 levels. But they look at it and see significant pricing opportunity moving forward."", ""JULIE HYMAN: At the same time, James-- hey, Julie here. It's good to see you. At the same time, the cruise industry's message has been we are a better value than a land-based vacation, right? All in. And so how much room do they still have to raise prices and still sort of tout that value opportunity for travelers?"", ""JAMES HARDIMAN: Sure. Yeah, so historically, we've talked about this maybe call it 20% to 30% discount to comparable land-based. Coming out of the pandemic, that number was probably closer to 35 to 50 depending on what you're looking at. And we've seen that gap close a little bit."", ""But I think that leaves still on a like-for-like basis a meaningful opportunity. And that doesn't factor in-- what I would argue is some pretty good innovation in the cruise industry."", ""We've seen a number of these companies make big investments in land-based attractions, right? Private islands, resorts, water parks. And I think, those investments have allowed them to cater to a multigenerational vacation. And I think that is only going to drive pricing higher from here."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, James, I'm curious, you look at the stocks of these names.

Broadly, as you look across the market, the industry, James, any signs of softness that you would point out?"", 'JAMES HARDIMAN: No, I mean, I think, geographically, the Caribbean is clearly the strongest region in the world right now.

On the other hand, the revenues surpassed the consensus mark and increased year over year.Hyatt’s quarterly results reflected year-over-year growth in comparable system-wide revenue per available room, driven by an increase in occupancy and average daily rate. This uptrend is mainly driven by strong global travel demand, especially among leisure and business guests, and group customers. Moreover, rapid improvement in Greater China and strengthening group demand in the United States are encouraging. However, increased costs and expenses and foreign currency risks partially offset the aforementioned tailwinds and hurt the bottom line.Planet Fitness, Inc.

It noted rises in penetration levels among all generational groups. However, the company cited concerns about continued macroeconomic uncertainty and a slowing down of sales (owing to a transition toward more strength equipment over cardio).

This move aligns with its strategic focus on United Arab Emirates (UAE) with new opportunities in the capital markets business.Since 2006, MS has been operating in Dubai, which is recognized as the Gulf’s financial hub, alongside Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Hence, the current move signifies the company’s long-term commitment to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.Abu Dhabi has become a preferred destination for global asset managers and fund management institutions over the past few years. The Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) is witnessing augmented demand in the hedge fund, venture capital and private equity domains, primarily from U.S.-based global asset managers.In the third quarter of 2023, AGDM's assets under management witnessed 52% growth, driven by contributions from these globally established institutions.Clare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA and CEO of Morgan Stanley & Co International plc, said, “We are delighted to be expanding our regional presence and commitment by opening an office in Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). There are exciting times ahead for the MENA region and as capital markets activity continues to grow and diversify it brings new and rewarding opportunities for both regional and global investors.”Apart from Morgan Stanley, several other global banks are expanding their footprint in Abu Dhabi to cater to the demands of a diverse investor pool of wealthy clients, hedge funds and alternative investment firms. The major attractions for these companies are Abu Dhabi’s oil wealth and the fact that it houses the headquarters of three sovereign wealth funds.In November 2023, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM announced it would begin offering deposit-taking and payment-processing services to wholesale banking clients from ADGM. The Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) granted approval to JPM to upgrade its license to category one, which allows it to offer the abovementioned services.Likewise, last May, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS announced plans to set up an office in Abu Dhabi to enhance its footprint in the MENA region. This was the second office of GS in UAE after the first one in the Dubai International Financial Centre.Morgan Stanley’s shares have gained 5.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 12.7% growth."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'MS presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Please go ahead.', 'Gunnar Georg Hansen', ""Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call for the quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you have had a chance to read them before the call. Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, February 29, 2024, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that thank you for joining us and I'll turn the call over to Peter."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Thank you, Gunnar, and welcome, everyone, to the call. It was a great quarter and a year of execution for Veeva, with strength across the business and results above our guidance. Total revenue in the quarter was $631 million with non-GAAP operating income of $239 million. For the year, total revenue was $2.4 billion, and non-GAAP operating income was $843 million. This past year was important in many ways for Veeva and the industry and I'm proud of all the team accomplished. We delivered the Veeva Compass Suite, giving the industry a better alternative to legacy data. We established the clinical platform and progressed on our new commercial cloud. It was a milestone year that I think we'll look back on as one of the most significant. We'll now open up the call to your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.', 'Joseph D. Vruwink', ""I wanted to ask about services outlook and how it's changed from your preliminary views. The shareholder letter mentions investments related to both CRM at large customers. Maybe you can just go into the approach you're planning to take with these initial migrations and how it is differing from those original plans? And then related to that question, does this outlook assume there's maybe more large customers, top 20 customers, ultimately undertaking migration activity than perhaps has been publicly announced to this point?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I'll take that one and then Paul, maybe you can join in as well. There's no major change in our strategy. It's just a refinement as things get closer into view. We've decided and have been able to provide a little more internal guidance about how much investment we'll make in Vault CRM related services. We think it's just the right thing to do. It's not -- moving to Vault CRM wasn't anything our customers asked for. They were happy with Veeva CRM. We're going to bring them a better solution over time, an integrated solution with sales, marketing and medical, all industry-specific all in the same database. But it wasn't anything really they were asking for or budgeting for. So we really want to do the right thing for those customers because remember, Vault CRM is just -- that's just one of the things that we have with those customers. We have big customer relationships and Vault CRM is just one of the things. So we want to help them through that. So no real change and Paul, in terms of progress with top 20 type CRM customers, maybe you can give an update."", 'Paul Shawah', ""Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. We're progressing well with our top 20 customers. Really, all of our customers are pleased to announce that we -- you heard us announce 2 top 20 global commitments. We announced that last quarter. I'm pleased to announce a third moving their existing Veeva CRM footprint. They're committing to move all of that over to Vault CRM, so now this is 3 top 20 pharmas. So that's just another example of the kinds of progress that we're making. We're also in deep conversation with all of the rest of top 20 and many other customers. And those conversations are progressing well, given the innovation that Peter has talked about. We're doing something fundamentally different integrating sales and marketing and medical in a very tight and unique way. So I'm optimistic you'll hear more about top 20s over time committing to Vault CRM."", 'Joseph D. Vruwink', ""Okay. That's great color and congratulations on the new win. At the segment level, maybe it looks like the commercial business is set to accelerate based on the outlook, R&D decelerating. I suppose I wanted to focus on R&D because there's quite a lot of traction just in terms of what is being awarded at the moment. I think there were two new enterprise EDC wins with top 20 this quarter, for example. Is maybe the rating between the lines that the level of activity is actually better than might be reflected in revenue just in this upcoming 12 months, but you're seeing visibility for maybe strength beyond this upcoming fiscal 2025?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes, I'll take that one. So if you -- if we step back just for a high level and how the business breaks down, overall, the TAM is about $20 billion, right? So it's a big TAM, and we're less than 15% penetrated. So we got a long way to go. That's important to remember that. It's a long-term thing that this is going to be a growing and profitable business for many years. And then the other thing is quite durable because these products are critical products and they're complex products. They're not things like e-mail or something like that. And then we have a lot of products that fit together. So with that context, I think it's relevant to look at the different parts. And you can really break it down into three parts from sort of a revenue perspective, the Development Cloud, the R&D area. That's the biggest one. It's about 50% of our revenue right now, and it's about 65% of our overall opportunity, and it's growing roughly 20% or so and that will really grow well into the foreseeable future. And because we have a lot of new products, we have a clear competitive advantage there, and these are mission-critical systems. Now what you mentioned, Joe, is customers don't rush in these areas. These are critical systems. They don't rush and these are some long-term programs. So for example, a couple of these wins that we had they will roll out and they will get to full revenue 4 and 5 years from now. So yes, the fiscal impact comes much later. One thing important to remember about 10 years ago, when we were going public, Development Cloud, that was quite a bit less than 5% of our revenue, and now it's over 40% and still growing on in the 20%. So that's Development Cloud. And then you've got this -- the other areas like our CRM and the add-ons, we kind of call that the CRM suite. And in that area, the revenue is stable. It's not really growing because of two things. One, we have really high market share and happy customers on our core CRM or Veeva CRM and some of the add-ons. And then we need to migrate those customers to Vault CRM before we can sell the new add-on products like marketing automation and service centers. So that's kind of a stable 25%. And then the other 25% roughly is a mix of other things in commercial. And if we call that other commercial, this is some stable things like commercial content and Crossix where we are the market leaders, but we continue to grow at a moderate and steady pace and customer success is really high with those products. And then newer products like Link and Compass. And these are small now, but they're growing rapidly on a percentage basis, and they have high potential if we can execute well. Now we have to remain -- see if we can execute well. So overall, this other commercial area that I talked about, that's growing roughly 15% or so now, and that can continue to grow into the foreseeable future as well. So I thought it was good to just give that background on how to look at the business overall."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays.', 'Saket Kalia', ""Okay. Great. Brent, maybe I'll start with you. Maybe just congrats on those two additional EDC wins. The question is, can you maybe talk about how billings ramps are sort of contributing to next year's billings, right? You've had great success in the EDC market. Is there a way to think about sort of next year's billings growth with or without those -- the benefits of those ramps. Does that make sense?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes. I understand. Thanks, Saket. So real pleased with how we exited Fiscal '24, exceeding our billings guide, so executing well there. And if you think about the EDC wins, by way of example, we're still pretty early days, as Peter said, so 5 of those top 8 wins have been in the last 12 months. So we're still early in that ramping phase. So they're contributing. They're contributing more in fiscal year '25 than they did in fiscal year '24. And those 8 will continue to contribute more as we look out forward."", 'Saket Kalia', ""Got it. Got it. That's helpful. Peter, maybe for my follow-up for you. It's a little bit of a higher-level question. Can you just give us an update on how you're feeling about the health of your end markets. I mean, it seems like things are just relatively stable compared to last quarter, which is great to hear. But since you spend just so much time with customers, how do you think customers are thinking about investing in technology here in 2024 versus what was a tougher 2023?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', 'Yes. I think there\'s a little more optimism. The science is going well. And we\'ve had this disruption of conflicts and interest rates for a while now and people are getting kind of used to it. So there\'s a little more optimism. Of course, things could change. I think that will translate into a bit more projects that get thought about this year, especially towards the end of the year. But a lot of that time, those things get kicked off in the following year. So a lot of our projects, you just don\'t wake up one day and say, ""Hey, let me redo my drug safety system. Now it\'s -- these are big projects. There\'s some change management and there\'s some thought into it. But overall, I like the feeling that I feel from the industry right now.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.', 'Hoi-Fung Wong', ""The first question for you, Brent. As I think about the outlook, you have solid teens growth on subscription and billing. Yet I couldn't help but notice you mentioned being a little more prudent with the outlook which I think is a language you guys haven't used in the past. So I guess I would love to get a sense as we think about the guide, are you baking in additional cushion? Is it just kind of thinking about when the progression of the demand might come back through the year. Would love any additional color you can give on just how you're thinking about the makeup of guidance?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes, Ken, overall, philosophically, there's no change to how we approach guidance. There's obviously a number of variables in play, whether it's the macro and the impact and how that's impacting our service or our subs business on billings, you got things like duration and frequency. So we kind of take a step back and look at all those variables, and we think we've taken a prudent approach holistically given the variables at hand. So not a fundamental change in how we guide."", 'Hoi-Fung Wong', ""Got it. Okay. Really appreciate that color. And then for Peter, on the EDC side, I feel like historically, you guys have talked about that end market through the lens of winning new trials and that being where maybe the opportunity set was. I couldn't help but notice in January you guys did a migration of a study portfolio for an enterprise customer. Like could we possibly see the installed base as a potential opportunity going forward based on what you saw with that migration?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Let's see. How to think about that. On the EDC, when we sell EDC field, there's really two types. One would be an enterprise deal and that's where we agree, hey, it's a long term, it's enterprise agreements that will ramp over time. And over time, you'll run all your studies on Veeva. And that doesn't -- the revenue for that doesn't change based on how fast they ramp or whether they migrate or whether they don't migrate. Then we have other ones which are study-by-study costs where sometimes it's with a CRO or a small biotech, they may be only running one or two or three studies, and we may compete for that study and win that study. The migration really won't impact our revenue directly at all. What it is, is, let's say, if a customer signs up for an enterprise agreement with ours, and they're rolling out and they're quite comfortable with Veeva. They might get to a point where they have 20, 30 studies that will run for a long time, and they want to clean up their IT environment, and they want to have a consistent clinical research site experience. So they use our migration tools to clean that up rather than having some straggling studies on the legacy technology for honestly, what could be 3, 4, 5 years. And that gets brittle. Who knows what could happen with that straggling vendor, whether it has a downtime, security patch needs to be put on, whatever it is, it's just not clean. So that migration capability actually translates into an advantage in our enterprise sales because we have that capability and nobody else really has that capability. So it would only have an effect there. It doesn't really affect in the small market where we're competing study by study."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James.', 'Brian Christopher Peterson', ""Congrats on the strong wins this quarter. There's been some mention in the past that some customers looking to take large bites of the apple and buying several products at once. We obviously hear a lot about wins across multiple product areas this quarter. I'm curious, are those concentrated with a few customers like the one with BI? Or is it much more diversified across the customer base? Any color there?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I guess I can take that one. I would say this is diversified, more diversified. We had some quality wins and those were with certain customers. We had a big clinical operations win for multiple clinical operations products. That was with a customer in Europe. We have a couple of EDC of top 20 and those were actually with different customers. So no, it's spread all around, I think, it's the best way to say it, both in U.S. and Europe and just different customers."", 'Brian Christopher Peterson', ""That's great to hear. And Brent, maybe a follow-up. I know the cash balance continues to grow. How are you guys thinking about looking at capital deployment priorities over the next few years here?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes. Overall, Brian, continuing to our current capital allocation strategy, no change. We run a profitable business. We generate a lot of cash. So we are focused on M&A as a use of that cash. And we are a disciplined company, and we'll take a disciplined approach to how we look at M&A. We do consider other uses of cash as a management leadership team, but our focus today is M&A."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Rishi Nitya Jaluria', ""I wanted to first ask on AI and maybe ask in a little bit different way because I know it feels like you're playing your cards a little bit close to the chest on your own AI strategy. But I want to ask what are you seeing out of life sciences companies in terms of how AI is changing things. Whether that's accelerating drug development, whether that's more targeted marketing, maybe if you could walk us through kind of what those conversations would look like? And what sort of role you think you can play in those changes? And I've got a quick follow-up."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Rishi, I would say the most direct impact and it's been happening a while before large language models as well with AI and drug discovery. Very, very targeted AI models that can do things like protein folding and analyzing retina images, things like that. So this is -- this is very powerful, but very therapeutic area specific, very close to the science in the R&D, and I -- there's not just one AI model there is multiple specialized AI models. So that's going on, and that will continue. I would say that's kind of part of the fabric of the industry now. Then in terms of other areas, really, there's a lot of experimentation with large language models. And what people look at it for are: a, can I just have general productivity for my people, can they write an e-mail faster? Can they check their e-mail faster? Can they research some information faster. So that's one thing that's going on. Also, specific use cases like authoring, can I -- can I author a protocol faster? Can I author a regulatory document faster. Now faster is one thing, but also have to be very accurate. So I would say there's experimentation on that. There's not yet broad production use on that. And certainly, some of these critical things has to be lot of quality control on it. So those are probably the two biggest use cases -- really three: research, general productivity and authoring. And then as far as our role, we've been doing some really heavy work over the last 2 years on something in our Vault platform that's called the Direct Data API. And that's a pretty revolutionary way of making the data come out of Vault in a consistent -- transactionally consistent manner much, much faster, roughly 100x faster than it happens now. That's going to be critical for all kinds of AI applications on the top, which we may develop, which our customers may develop, and we're also utilizing that for some really fast system to system transfer between our different Vault family. So that's been the biggest thing that we've done. We haven't really invested heavily in large language models. So far, we just don't see quite the application in our application areas, not to say that, that wouldn't change in the future. I would -- I guess, I would say we're in a pretty good position because AI really -- the durable thing about AI is the data sources, the data sources. The AI models will come on top, and that will be largely a tech commodity, but the control and the access to the data sources, that's pretty important, and that's kind of where Veeva plays."", 'Rishi Nitya Jaluria', ""Yes. Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then you had your first full Vault clinical ops suite customer in the deal -- sorry, in the quarter, can you maybe talk about the uplift from eTMF to adopting the full suite, what that looks like and what you can do to maybe accelerate more of those types of wins?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', 'Yes. Now that\'s the specifics of that customer, of course, I won\'t go into the exact specifics here, but I can quickly give you my thoughts on it. I would say there that customer had eTMF, and that\'s one of our larger applications and has had for a number of years, fully deployed that one. When they got the other four applications in clinical operations, they more than tripled our opportunity, our end-state in clinical operations, so in that case. And I won\'t go into the exact numbers, but I know it\'s more than tripled. So it\'s significant. When you look at the CTMS, the clinical trial management system, that\'s a really important system study training, really important system for training thousands of research sites around the world and maintaining compliance and doing that in a friendly way. The payments processing. That\'s another thing that\'s key, processing the payments out to the clinical research sites and then our product called Site Connect, which is about automating the information flow from the sites to the research -- sorry, from the sites to the pharma company. During the startup, during the conduct of the study and also critically at the end of the study, things that are called end-of-study media that have to get out to the site and we\'re doing that in an automated way. So there\'s a ton of value there that more than triples our value of eTMF.And I would say last comment. That customer won\'t always be like that where a customer says, ""Hey, we just really want to modernize clinical operations, and we\'re looking to this partner to do it, and we\'re going to do it in a holistic way over a number of years across a number of products."" What\'s more common is there\'s a need in a certain area ,study training. The study training group has a need, hey let\'s use Veeva or the payments group has a need, hey, let\'s use Veeva. That\'s still the more common use case.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Stan Berenshteyn with Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Stanislav Berenshteyn', ""So you rolled out Compass Prescriber, Compass National. I realize it's still early, but can you share any anecdotes about customer reception, customer demand on those products?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', 'Yes. It\'s very early. It\'s a good question, especially well, Compass patients, but especially Prescriber and National, these are quite innovative products. So it\'s going to take a while for customers to understand and adopt these. It\'s almost like going from the cloud -- sorry, from client server to cloud. It\'s sort of, wow. It\'s a different way of doing things. So the reaction from the customers has first been for some, they\'re busy and they\'re not interested. For some, they are like, ""Oh, I want to look into this."" And then when they look into this, like, well, wow, this is really different. And they have to absorb that a little bit. This is really different. And then for some early adopters, they have jumped on like, \'Wow, I can target physicians that I\'ve never been able to target before."" I can see data on my competitors\' products that are administered in the medical setting, not a retail product, I can see that down to the ZIP code level and the HCP level. And I can see things like unattributed scripts that where we don\'t -- where the -- the health -- the doctor is not specified, but they can see the health system. These are things that were just not possible before. So and for a long time, not possible for really 20 years here. So now it\'s the process of wow, that data is available, what should I do with that data? How can I optimize? So it\'s -- it\'s going to take some time, and it\'s for early adopters, which will generally come in innovative companies coming to market. They don\'t have any existing infrastructure and they\'re innovative type people and hey, let\'s just go for that. And then what we\'ve had is some brands in large companies that are small brands, precommercial brands, and they\'re thinking, ""Wow, I can -- they have some freedom and latitude to go off and do what they do. And they\'re getting this new data set, they\'re, okay, we\'ll go for that. The hardest ones and what just takes time, the well, the big established brands, right? Because they have a motion, and it\'s going and it\'s working. Very reticent to disrupt that because they have a limited patent life of these products, and they don\'t want to be risky in there. So that\'s a little bit of color of what we\'re seeing.', 'Stanislav Berenshteyn', ""That's very interesting. I appreciate that. Maybe as a follow-up, just sticking with the marketing theme here. You called out strength in Crossix. It seems it's pretty broad-based based on the prepared remarks. Is it just overall market growth? Or are you actually taking share as well here?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I believe we're taking share, yes. What's happened is we just continue to track record of customer success, just sort of grind it out. All the customers are successful with Crossix, our data network for what we're doing there is the largest and most applicable. So I think during some boom times there was a little more experimentation with other areas. Some people got their fingers burned a little bit. And I think that we haven't. We haven't burned anybody's fingers. So customer success leads the way. I think that's the main thing."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.', 'Brent Alan Bracelin', ""I was hoping to go back to the demand environment with a specific lens towards the SMB segment and then the top 50 enterprise segment. Can you maybe just compare, contrast what you're seeing in SMB? Are there any green shoots there or not? And then also compare that with the enterprise top 50 segments, what are you seeing there relative to this year versus last year?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I'll take that one. This is Peter. The emerging biotechs, the small center of the segment is still a tough sliding there. This year, we saw a record number of companies get acquired and go out of business and a small number of new companies were able to get escape velocity because of the funding environment it's tough, and it continues to be tough. And you never know when it turns around until it turns around, all you know is that it hasn't turned around yet. Then in the top 50, I would say the feeling is just kind of a bit resigned that, hey, we're in for -- there's some global conflicts, there's inflation, there's IRA act, but that hasn't hurt us too bad yet, so we could just keep going. Also, there's -- I think there's a renewed focus on execution and long-term execution. They're really seeing that that's important. I think there's some excitement about the science as well. Like, for example, we have some really big brands now in the Bay city area. That's something that didn't exist 3, 4 years ago. And so that's renewing people's optimism like, wow, the science will lead the way. So it's really different in the top 50 versus the emerging biotechs."", 'Brent Alan Bracelin', ""Helpful color there. And then my follow-up is back to M&A. And the question here is fiscal 2025 is going to be a very important year and that cash flow could exceed $1 billion for the first time. You have $4 billion in cash. Just thinking through the philosophy on M&A. Historically, it's been around small technology tuck-ins. You're a much bigger business, you got a lot more cash flow generating coming in every year. Would you ever think about maybe larger bolt-on acquisition to go after a new area? Just thinking through M&A a little differently given the size of the business today and outsized cash generation you're generating now as well?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes. I can talk to the general philosophy of M&A. I think it's no secret, I can just give you the formula. First of all, it has to make some business sense with the market. It has to be a market that we're interested to go in, either it's complementary or somewhat adjacent to what we're doing. So that would be number one. It has to have a cultural fit with the company that you're considering acquiring because otherwise, it just absolutely will not work. And 80% of acquisitions fail. But at Veeva, we've had all of our acquisitions succeed. So it's this discipline. The cultural fit is a real thing, and it's an indicator of many things, not that our culture is the best culture or whatever, but a company that doesn't fit with our culture, it will not be a successful acquisition. Third, you need to have a very clear product and organizational structure plan that's been thought out ahead of time so that you could announce it to both teams from the day you would acquire them. If that doesn't happen, it's an indicator that you don't have enough bench strength to operate this thing. And therefore, you'll lose it in the integration or the business strategy isn't actually clear because you can't say it to people. So in that, I think those are the parameters. So I don't think we would be limited by size. If we saw something that was right that fit those parameters and that would cost us $3 billion more than we would go for that. But the other thing you need to is you need a willing seller. And so it's timing of it. And that's why 80% of acquisitions fail is because people rush in and they buy things that don't fit these parameters. We're just not going to do that. I would rather return money to shareholders than waste it on a failed acquisition."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jack Wallace with Guggenheim Securities.', 'Jack Dawson Wallace', ""Just wanted to go back to the guide and it seems like there's been a lot of big momentum coming into the year. We've got some price increases. We've got some ramping deals. I think the pipeline is healthy of willing buyers, but at times maybe a little bit of a question mark. I don't want to belabor the term prudent here, but it does feel like there's more sources of potential upside in a higher floor of -- whether it's billings or subscription revenue that you kind of really had coming into the year and that it's just a matter of grinding out a handful of strategic wins in order to how to get to the high end or get above the guidance range. Am I thinking about that correctly?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes. So what I would say is I wouldn't interpret the choice of words of prudent as there's this incremental level of conservatism that's baked into the guide. I guess I would start there. We've considered all the factors that we've talked about on the call today. And we've considered those and we think we have a guide that's reflective of the best calls of the numbers like we have historically. So I would think of it that way. There's a number of items to contemplate in like the services portion of the business, which can be a little bit lumpy at that business. But overall, we feel really good and have conviction on the numbers we provided."", 'Jack Dawson Wallace', ""That's helpful. And then just on the 1Q guidance, was there any lingering impact from rep reductions that you had over the last couple of years just impacting 1Q? And then just on the services. It just seems you're taking a more aggressive approach there. I'm just wondering how much kind of automation potential is at play to help improve the CRM migrations?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""I can take the first portion of that on the -- on your question around rep reductions. There's -- the digital portion of those rep reductions, that's largely behind us. So there's I wouldn't think of that as an incremental headwind as you look at fiscal year '25."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.', 'Karl Emil Keirstead', ""Brent, could we talk about your decision to raise the operating income guidance for fiscal '25. To me, that's meaningful. A number of software companies seem to be going the other way where against the backdrop of needing to lean into R&D, invest in AI, they're posting somewhat skinnier margin upside. But you've raised it to a pretty high 30s level. Can you talk about your calculus there?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes, I'm happy to. So maybe just first taking a big step back, so we provided $1 billion-plus guide about a year ago, which is a bit not typical, and we wanted to provide some context around the TFC standardization. So now you fast forward 12 months, and from that, we've been executing well, right? We've been executing over the past year. And the 39% reflects that. And that reflects our operating model and the efficiency and effectiveness we get out of our operating model, and also the power and efficiency of the Vault platform. So it really comes down to that. We're making the investments we see are necessary to drive customer success and growth. We're not short changing those. And -- but overall, it's just about execution."", 'Karl Emil Keirstead', ""And Brent, maybe as my follow-up -- I'm sorry, are we going to say something?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes, I would just say we're -- this is Peter. We're -- as we scale, I think we're getting a little more efficient, getting more efficient in our processes, in our customer relationships, in our use of our Vault platform, and we're being diligent. That was a concept we call lean teams. Not doing layoffs, but we want lean teams. We want the smallest teams possible with high-performance people that can perform well together. So this kind of discipline that's why our margins are increasing. And I think you'll see that from us increasing margins over time."", 'Karl Emil Keirstead', ""Got it. Okay. Helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, if we could just go back to the optimism comment. It sounds like both of you, Peter and Brent are dissuading us from thinking that, that increased optimism would have any real impact on revenues and billings this year? I think we're hearing that message. But if I could just press, why not. Why not if your clients are getting a little more optimistic, could projects that might be stalled start to move forward, discretionary spend start to come back. Why not?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I think most of these things that we deal with, we have very little discretionary stand other than in services, right, because we deal with these critical systems and complex system and they have more thinking time. They have more thinking time. So I just don't think it's stuff that would impact this year. And having said that, we don't know what's going to happen this year. We do live in some uncertain times. We have some interest rate things going on. We've got two global conflicts going on. So we have to figure that uncertainty. Again, it's not a guarantee that in September, everything is going to be the same as it is right now."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company.', 'Ryan Michael MacDonald', ""Maybe first to start out with CRM. I noticed the 9 wins in the quarter and even mix of 5 Vault and 4 Veeva CRM. Just curious what you're hearing in terms of the rationalization from customers on still selecting Veeva CRM. Is it something that they don't want to wait till April of '24 to be able to do so or anything like that? And then is there -- are you contracting in a different way now for Veeva CRM versus Vault, whether it be duration or putting in commitments to migrate over to the new CRM. Just any color there would be helpful?"", 'Paul Shawah', ""Yes, Ryan, I can take that. This is Paul. So the conversations we have with all of these customers, it's a dialogue. We go in with full transparency. We talk about why they want to choose one or the other. We don't go in with a preconceived notion. We listen and talk to the customer. And then based on what their requirements are, we guide them. We try to lead the customer and make sure we make the right decision.There may be reasons to do Veeva CRM that includes some very specific features and functions that they really need early on that they want to start their way. That would be a common example of why they may choose Veeva CRM over Vault CRM. But those things are going away quickly. Just to give you a perspective, we'll be a general availability in April. We're well on the way and on track for that and at full parity with everything in Veeva CRM will be in Vault CRM by the end of this year. So it's really a timing issue. And starting in April, everything will be Vault. And we're comfortable and confident in that time line and that milestone. So that gives you some guidance there. In terms of the -- how we're contracting, we're contracting in a very similar way. There's not really a material change. So the licensing is not exactly the same, but it's very similar. And then in terms of timing of contracts, it's pretty much all the same, annual deals that we do, and it's all per user base."", 'Ryan Michael MacDonald', ""Super helpful. I appreciate that. Maybe a follow-up on the data strategy. Obviously, early days with the new Prescriber, National data available now. But one thing we've seem to have picked up from other vendors in the data space is that there's sort of this constant need for it, whether it be maintenance or additions to grow their data sets over time to remain competitive and maybe those are vendor-specific issues. But I'm curious now that you've got Prescriber and National rolled out in addition to Patient, how you're thinking about sort of that data expansion or acquisition strategy moving forward, whether that's organic or if you -- and you license it from other sources or maybe M&A makes sense. Just curious how you're thinking about data expansion strategy moving forward."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""In terms of data acquisition, yes, we make end data products that we sell to our customers. And of course, we buy data inputs, call it data acquisitions. We have a pretty unique strategy as it relates to Compass, where we're really multisourcing. We're sourcing data from a lot of different sources, and we have really excellent industry-leading patient tokenization process that's kind of fundamentally different than the common one out there. So when we do this, we can multisource from a lot of different places bring it together and avoid duplicates. So when we do that, we'll have more data sources than what's common, but no data source will be particularly extra critical to us. So when we see a good deal for a data source and a good set of terms, which means we can contract it for a number of years, and we know what the cost is and it's not that expensive, we'll do that. And if we see something that's not good, such as, hey, we don't have stability over multiple years or the cost is too high than we want to pay, then we just won't purchase that. So you're not going to see anything dramatic from Veeva. There's no step function in cost or something like that. Very importantly for us, these data acquisitions, they power both our Crossix business and our compass business. So that's very different, right? With one set of data purchases, we're able to power two good-sized businesses and so that lowers our percentage data cost."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.', 'David Howard Windley', 'Peter, does Annex 1 have any stimulative impact on your quality products, the need for your quality products? Does that regulation in Europe influence that at all?', 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I don't know that one. I probably -- if I do some research, I can figure out what Annex 1 is, but we'll have to get back to you. We can get back to you offline as long as it's not a material nonpublic thing. So sorry about that one. you stumped me on that one."", 'David Howard Windley', ""Well, I'm sorry, I did that, but I'll ask a different one instead. So on the data comments that you just made about your data sourcing strategy, does the breadth I think I understood you to say that ability to be flexible allows you to buy when you see good deals. I was going to ask, does the breadth cause you to have to pay more money? Or does your operating expense base grow disproportionately because of the breadth of that data? Maybe the answer is the opposite."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I can only really comment on our strategy. I wouldn't really know exactly as it compares to others. We believe we have a lower overall beta cost because of this. That's what we believe. Now the main reason we do this is for data quality. So if you're getting data from three different sources, that they're somewhat overlapping, you have a better chance of getting data quality. And this is one of the reasons why we can project data for medical claims, which is -- it might be something that's done in an infusion center. We can also project something for something that you pick up at Walgreens or CVS. Why? Well, because we're sourcing data from multiple points along the line. So the real benefit is more holistic view of the patient, we can project data for over 4,000 brands. And you can only do that. You can't do that if you're just projecting based on a few large retailers' data, you can't do that. Because if you look at 20 years ago or 25 when these legacy data products were started, or even when Veeva started in 2007, the biggest brand at the time was Lipitor and you've got Lipitor at the drugstore. Biggest brand now is Keytruda and you don't just walk into the drugstore and get that. It doesn't work that way or HUMIRA, et cetera. So ours is a modern approach that I think is the only way really to do it well for today's complex therapies. And I do think we'll have lower data cost over time. I do think that, but I don't have to prefer that."", 'David Howard Windley', ""Got it. And then a follow-up relatedly, and again, not to ask a stumper, but this Change Healthcare cyber hack situation where some data is being held hostage in a fairly significant health care data switch, is that a situation that, say, in the future when your products are more mature that, that actually feeds to the way that you're collecting data and makes you more reliable than maybe some others might be?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes. Now as it relates to Change, I am aware of that, of course, not the very specific details of the attack. I am aware of how the attack was made, but I'm not aware of the -- what's going on inside the Change. But and I'm not going to disclose whether we get data from them or not. But yes, it is a switch. Now the good thing that happens here for the health care system most of the pharmacies are operating on relatively modern software such that they can point their software to different switches, and there are standards that are in play. So that's a good thing that the health care system can recover. For us, again, without going into a lot of details, whichever way the data gets routed, there's a real good chance we're going to pick it up because we're picking it up in multiple places along the way. So I'm not -- even if we were at scale in our business, I would -- it's certainly unfortunate what happened with Change, and I think it's terrible what's going on with these cyber attacks, but it wouldn't affect our Compass or Crossix business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.', 'Craig Matthew Hettenbach', ""I have a question for Brent on a margin. Nice to see the strong guidance on fiscal '25. Can you just touch on -- there's some element of services OpEx coming down. Is this -- do you think a new run rate beyond '25 or is there normalization when you think about margins after this year?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes, and I would say, overall, the margin uplift we're seeing isn't really driven by services. I would say it's really a more broad thing. It's broadly how we're executing and that how we leverage again our operating model, thinking about lean teams and really disciplined hiring broadly. So we feel good about how we've executed there. And that's basically what's informed in our guide for the full fiscal year. I'm not going to talk beyond fiscal year '25 at this point in time. But we feel good about our ability to hit those operating income and margin targets."", 'Craig Matthew Hettenbach', ""Got it. And then just a follow-up for Peter. Just on the momentum you're seeing in EDC wins. Can you touch on what you think is resonating most with new customers and then just key differentiating factors versus competitive offerings?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', 'Well, as we get into this middle part of the market, I think a required thing would be positive customer references, right? If we -- if our existing customers weren\'t happy and productive these current sales would not be happening because it is very easy for them to reach out to their peers and get a very authentic ""hey, you\'re using Veeva today. How are you feeling about that?"" So I would say our customer success is leading the way. And then in terms of capabilities, it\'s agile study build to be able to build a complex study that has multiple arms quicker and more reliably. That\'s a big benefit. I would say the sort of what I would say, no coding. A lot of the existing -- at least a couple of the existing providers actually end up doing a lot of coding, actual coding work when you build a study. Now that is interesting for whoever is coding that study, but it\'s a bit of a headache for the people managing the study because when you have coating, it\'s hard to keep that under control and the complexity grows and there can be errors and unforeseen things. So with Veeva, you don\'t do the custom coding. I would say the other one is people want a clinical platform, and that is clinical operations and clinical data management. And that\'s not something you can get from the existing leaders in the clinical data management area. So that then the customer has to develop a common data architecture between their clinical operations and their clinical data management from two different vendors. They have to develop the integrations. They have to keep those integrations running as both products change. And that\'s really a headache that people don\'t want to deal with. So I would say it\'s those things that are contributing. And you might ask, well, how come everybody is not buying it all today that well, customers have priorities, and this is changing a very, very critical system, and you better have a good reason to do it. You don\'t do it unless you have pain in that area and not all customers have pain all at the same time.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Anne Samuel with JPMorgan.', 'Anne Elizabeth Samuel', ""I was hoping to go back to the earlier question around optimism.

And maybe any other notable green shoots that you can point to that are maybe driving your comments around optimism in the space?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I guess I can take that one. For the budget flush, we don't really see that too much because ours are more critical and complex things, not so much discretionary. So we don't -- we just don't really see that as much. That may have happened. We just don't see it as much. And then in terms of the optimism overall, it's -- I want everybody to be clear, this is based on a feeling on intuition, based on lots of discussions. And we have deep relationships with the customers because we have big strategic partnerships. So that's all. There's no -- I can't calculate it down into science.

A question for me. It would be great to get an update on any impact you're noticing in the industry due to any regulatory changes, particularly as biopharma companies think about potential future impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act and how that might change the way they invest? And then also just how customers are thinking about the risks associated with the upcoming election and how you're thinking about any potential impact?"", 'Paul Shawah', ""Yes. Callie, this is Paul. So I guess the way to think about regulations, and particularly, you brought up specifically the IRA. Our customers are certainly thinking about it, and they're thinking about it, first and foremost, on the drug development side because that's really the long -- that's the long cycle in terms of what that starts to impact. The decisions that they make today around where the -- which kinds of molecules they're going to invest in small molecules, large molecules, which indications they're going to try to get approval for. Those are the kinds of things that will have an impact as it relates to the IRA. So those decisions and those thinking is happening now. So I would say that it's more acute on the R&D side than it is on the commercial side. From a commercial standpoint, the -- it doesn't really hit until 2026, and then it's somewhat gradual and it's somewhat focused and acute on specific companies. So more thinking and more action on R&D. And I think over time, it will start to impact more of the commercial side, but companies are responding. They're making decisions. They're making changes, and they're also innovating. You heard some of the optimism around the science and the innovation of the new medicines. So I think there's also a lot of optimism that the industry will continue to innovate and kind of drive through some of the negative or the potential headwinds of IRA. In terms of other things like elections and kind of other regulatory changes, those things are generally -- this is a generalization, but they're generally neutral to net positive because when you modernize and you become more digital, you generally need to -- it helps companies become more agile. When regulations are put in place, you need to comply, you may need to change, and drive change management. And that usually is to the benefit of becoming more digital and using technology to comply with regulation.

I am excited about it. And I think the timing is great. That hasn't been a new entrant in that market for that type of data really for that projected data for more than 15 years since Veeva started. And it's critical data. It's used for segmentation and targeting, field force sizing, how big is your field team? Who are you going to call on the tactics that you're going to use, use for incentive compensation, business planning, critical things. And I feel like we're -- we had a vision when we bought Crossix, say we would get Crossix.It has a data network. We liked the Crossix business. We can grow it and we can add more data sources, grow that data network and use that to really do something innovative in data around Compass. And we stuck to the plan, and I'm proud of over the last couple of years, we've always taken the innovative approach on Compass, not the easy approach of copying what's out there. And so now it's coming to fruition and it feels great. It just feels like when we started Vault. It's innovative so that only 1 out of 20 people really get it, right? Because it's innovative and it's different and it's, wow, what is this? But I think the facts are on our side. So I think the timing couldn't be better, and I'm really happy with the team we have. And I'm really happy we have some happy early customers. But I don't want to get out ahead of our skis. With Prescriber and National, we just released them in the end of January, gosh. So we released the December data set in the end of January.

This replatforming, you think about it, since we're in the life sciences industry, you could think about it as a strong medicine that Veeva has to take for the industry, right, to do this replatforming. It's not a positive to the revenue in the short term, but it's the right thing and it will be a positive to the revenue in the long term. For example, this marketing automation that we're building, I think it could be extra, extra, extra innovative because it will be life sciences specific, it will be regionally aware which is the way you do this stuff in Japan and Germany and the U.S. is quite different in life sciences. And it will be aware of the field, the sales team. So you could use our marketing automation to inform your sales team of marketing for sure, but let your sales team control some part of marketing or you could use a campaign to control your sales team, all opposite because they're all operating on the same data, the same segment. So it's like having Marketo inside of Salesforce.com and industry specific. That's not been done before. So as you can tell, I'm excited about the future, and we'll be able to show some of these products at our Customer Summit in May, especially the call center one, the service center is really coming along. So I'm really happy about it. But yes, we've got to take this medicine for 3 or 4 years, and it doesn't taste good right now. How about that?"", 'Operator', 'Our final question will come from the line of Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen.', 'Charles Rhyee', ""Really just some follow-up questions, maybe for Brent on just the guidance then. Obviously, op margins, you're guiding sort of 38% in the first quarter, full year, more like 39%. Any color you can give in terms of how we should think of cadence for margins through the course of the year? And then secondly, in the subscription revenue guidance, how much of that is already contracted at this point? And how much maybe do you need to win over the course of the year?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes. What I would say on the -- regarding the op income op margin, we feel -- again, we provided guidance for the full year in Q1. There's always going to be a little bit of movement between quarters. But overall, we feel really good about how we're executing in the efficiency that we have. So I'm not going to provide any additional color on how Q2, Q3 and the slope of that curve. But just know that we're executing well, and we feel good about those numbers. Then your other -- your secondary question, sorry, I didn't write it down. It was around subscription?"", 'Charles Rhyee', 'In the subscription revenue guidance, how much of that is already contracted versus how much you maybe need to win through the course of the year?', 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes. What I would say is our visibility is at least equally as good, if not better than it was in previous times. So we have visibility and the part of that continues to get informed as we close more business and we have these ramping deals. So visibility is at least as good as we've had in the past."", 'Operator', ""I'll now hand the call back to Peter Gassner for any closing remarks."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""First off, thanks to everybody who asked these really thoughtful and insightful questions. Thanks for your interest in Veeva and your understanding of Veeva. The good questions help everybody have more clarity. I really appreciate that. And then I'd like to close by thanking our customers for their trust and partnership and the Veeva team for all the work in the year and that I believe will have a major impact on the industry and drive our growth for years to come.

(NYSE:CRM) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest annual results, and the shares gained 5.2% to US$309. The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$35b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Salesforce surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$4.20 per share, modestly greater than expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce ', ""Following the latest results, Salesforce's 42 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$38.1b in 2025. This would be a meaningful 9.3% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to jump 43% to US$6.13. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$38.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.42 in 2025. There was no real change to the revenue estimates, but the analysts do seem more bullish on earnings, given the decent improvement in earnings per share expectations following these results."", ""The consensus price target rose 10% to US$325, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Salesforce analyst has a price target of US$390 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$231. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Salesforce's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 9.3% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 19% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 12% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Salesforce is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants."", ""The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Salesforce's earnings potential next year. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Salesforce's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

Now, the chief financial officer noted that Salesforce was not factoring in material contribution from AI products, expecting to see it in two or three years. For more on how investors can discern the early beneficiaries of generative AI, let's bring in Fred Havemeyer who is the Macquarie head of US AI software research. Fred, always a pleasure to speak with you, get some time here. First and foremost with Salesforce and how they're going to be able to see this factored in to the financial performance in the future, what should investors expect as to the timeline when that will really pass through to some of the margins that we're seeing thus far?"", ""FRED HAVEMEYER: So with Salesforce, firstly, I think what we saw is that the company is once again committed to delivering margin, delivering profitability, and doing all of the things that we believe are really critical for the story as a profitable growth story, one that is prudent about investments and costs. Now, we're very excited about generative AI, where that's going to go, and how Salesforce can benefit from it. But big picture, we think that the ramp up to material contribution to revenue will take a bit of time and this is consistent across all of our coverage."", ""We think that, generally, enterprise adoption of generative AI software will begin to take off in 2024, but then ramp further into 2025 and 2026. Our base case here is generally that enterprises are beginning with testing generative AI software. They're not necessarily going to deploy it everywhere at once and let customers and their employees just use it immediately. Rather they want to be careful and take their time on ensuring that generative AI products are both safe, reliable, and responding as one would expect and one normally would get from an employee of their own company. So I think it's extremely exciting, but we're going to be patient about where and when revenues appear from AI in Salesforce's model."", ""SEANA SMITH: Fred, one of the big headlines out of this print was the fact that the company declared a dividend here following the footsteps of Meta. I'm curious from your perspective, analyst's perspective obviously, what that tells us about the confidence within management about the future financial success of Salesforce and how big of a boost do you see this being in the long run?"", ""FRED HAVEMEYER: So with the addition of dividend here in the company, also consistently returning capital to investors through buybacks, what we're seeing is that we believe Salesforce here is really showing their dedication to deploying their cash flows in ways that are rewarding investors and their confidence in Salesforce. And so where the company is focusing again on profitability, and cash flows, and growing those cash flows nicely north of 20% year over year in 2025, fiscal '25, they see this as an opportunity to return more cash to shareholders. And I think that it adds to a very-- it adds a very nice aspect to this story that you can follow along for the growth, for the upside from AI, but you're also being rewarded with both more margin, more profitability, more cash flows, and at the end of the day more cash being returned to"", 'BRAD SMITH: Investors. you know I want to go further down that line here. Because as we think about where companies and companies like Salesforce, companies like Microsoft, Google are putting their AI products or solutions out into the market and seeing where some of their clients hop on what the generative AI prompt experience can look like that creates an output and ultimately creates these co-pilots that come to be expected within the workforce, who is winning the battle of the copilot right now?', ""FRED HAVEMEYER: I think it's so early days that it remains an open field. I think in terms of the technology, OpenAI still appears to be in a position where they're serving the best models. Microsoft, we think, is leading the charge with productizing these as copilots and delivering them to enterprises."", ""But overall, I think what we've also seen recently with how Gemini has been in the news and responding to prompts with outputs that many have begun criticizing recently, I think that it really shows-- the Gemini responses, for example, show how businesses are likely to be very careful with how they're adopting AI because they need to ensure that the output coming out accurately reflects what their businesses are saying, doing, and their data, their positioning, et cetera. So I think that in this testing phase, we're very early days. I think that Microsoft, Salesforce, and the like, but Microsoft especially, is the furthest along here and is winning presently the copilot debate. But nevertheless, it's extremely early days and we think it's an open field for competition."", 'SEANA SMITH: All right, Fred Havemeyer, Macquarie head of US AI software research, thanks.', 'FRED HAVEMEYER: Thank you.']"

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Sealed Air's shares on or after the 7th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 22nd of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.20 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.80 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Sealed Air has a trailing yield of 2.3% on the current share price of US$34.76. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Sealed Air has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' See our latest analysis for Sealed Air ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Sealed Air paying out a modest 34% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 43% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio."", ""It's positive to see that Sealed Air's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Sealed Air's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 20% per annum for the past five years. Sealed Air is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Sealed Air has lifted its dividend by approximately 4.4% a year on average. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Sealed Air is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business."", ""Should investors buy Sealed Air for the upcoming dividend? Sealed Air has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination.

The stocks mostly trended down at the beginning of the week on concerns regarding inflation and its consequence on the Federal Reserve’s pledge for a slew of rate cuts this year. However, as data for the core personal consumption expenditures price index was made public, stocks rose to their first closing record since November 2021.The core personal consumption expenditures price index for January was up 0.4% month-over-month and 2.8% on a year-over-year basis. This was mostly on par with broad-based expectations that fueled the uptrend.Earlier, the Fed had pledged to cut interest rates several times in 2024 owing to a decelerating inflation trend in the later stages of 2023. However, given the recent inflationary data, the markets appear vulnerable to sudden downtrends. This, in turn, signifies that the markets need to brace for intense volatility owing to tempered expectations despite a relatively healthy U.S. economy and GDP data.Amid the uncertainty, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, make the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Synopsys, Inc. SNPS and Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. WMS are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.', ""Percentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.Zacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions.

Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are three stocks out of the five that made it through this screen:Headquartered in New York, Ralph Lauren is a major designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products in North America, Europe, Asia and internationally.

Many of these companies -- Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla -- have seen their share prices double, triple, or even quadruple in value over just a handful of years.', 'While investing in the Magnificent Seven may still be a smart decision, investors looking for the biggest growth opportunities should look elsewhere. After huge runs, nearly every company in the Magnificent Seven is now worth at least $1 trillion, the exception being Tesla, which has a market capitalization of around $650 billion.', ""These megacorporations should continue to grow, but doubling or tripling in size will be increasingly difficult. It's unlikely any of these stocks will soar 1,000% over the coming years. If you want that type of rapid growth, you need to focus on stocks like Shopify (NYSE: SHOP)."", 'If you are looking for the next Magnificent Seven stock, it makes sense to ask why these companies were so successful in the first place. Each company followed its own growth trajectory, but they all share a common trait: exposure to platforms.', ""What exactly is a platform? As the name suggests, it is a foundation upon which other things can be built. Consider Amazon. It offers a platform on which buyers and sellers can transact. Importantly, Amazon isn't the one building everything. It is the buyers and sellers themselves who populate the platform with utility. In this way, Amazon can have a business that has millions of merchants without needing to operate millions of stores itself."", ""Google parent Alphabet is another great example of a platform-like business. The company didn't create the internet, but its business in many ways allows today's internet model to operate. The web's billions of websites and applications aren't all built directly on Google, but they generate revenue for the company without requiring Google to launch or run these websites itself."", ""Not every company in the Magnificent Seven is the perfect definition of a platform, but they all benefit from platform economics. That is, they are able to leverage the growth of millions of other businesses and consumers without needing to build all the infrastructure themselves. Outside app developers made Apple's App Store a giant success, not Apple alone. Meta's user base builds the vast majority of content on the company's platforms, not Facebook. Tesla has open-sourced much of its charging technology so that other companies can develop alongside it. Microsoft's Windows operating system is one of tech's earliest platform success stories. And even Nvidia, which arguably has the fewest platform characteristics to its business model, is directly exposed to the growth of platforms as it sells millions of chips every year to companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and Amazon."", 'Want to find the next Magnificent Seven stock? Look for platform businesses.', ""Shopify is an e-commerce platform primarily focused on independent merchants. While Amazon's growth relies on merchants using its website, Shopify allows anyone to use its platform for launching their own e-commerce site. Shopify's technology, which includes crucial features like payment processing, inventory management, and marketing analytics, silently runs in the background."", ""This is not an early-stage growth company. More than one million merchants already use Shopify's platform, from small upstarts to megabrands like Nike and Everlane. Revenue growth rates have consistently remained in the double digits, while free-cash-flow levels have improved considerably with the maturity of the business."", ""Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2015, Shopify stock has increased in value by 2,900%. Now with a $100 billion market cap, it is likely that the company's fastest growth rates are behind it. Still, there's plenty of reason to believe its growth can match or exceed that of the Magnificent Seven in the years to come."", 'In general, the e-commerce industry should provide Shopify with a rising tide for at least another decade. Global e-commerce sales are expected to exceed $6 billion in 2024, surpassing $8 trillion by 2027. Even if Shopify simply maintained its market share and pricing power, it could add another $30 billion to its market cap in the coming years just by riding industry growth.', ""Industry growth, however, is just a starting point for Shopify's future.

Part of this rise is the frenzy of artificial intelligence (AI) investing, as Microsoft positioned itself at the forefront of this exciting trend.', 'While Microsoft may not be as exposed as other companies like Nvidia, it still plays a huge role in the rollout of AI to the average worker. But does this position make Microsoft a top AI investment right now?', ""Most people know Microsoft's products as they use them daily in their jobs. However, Microsoft aims to make these workers more efficient by integrating AI."", ""Microsoft partnered with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into many products. Microsoft Copilot is available for businesses as a $30 monthly add-on to Microsoft 365. While that may seem like a lot, it's a bargain."", ""If Copilot can make 100 employees 1% more efficient, it could replace one worker. The annual cost for Copilot for these 100 workers would be $36,000. Considering that the average salary in the U.S. in 2024 is just over $53,000 per year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, this would be a significant cost savings. That's also a low-ball estimate, as its Copilot product can make employees more than 1% more efficient."", ""Additionally, Microsoft is highly exposed to the AI trend through its cloud computing product, Azure. Cloud computing is crucial in the proliferation of AI, allowing clients to rent out computing power. Most businesses don't require a supercomputer on hand to train AI models. Instead, they can offload some of that work to Microsoft's servers, which they can use by paying a rental fee."", ""Azure has been a powerhouse segment for Microsoft as it rose 30% in the fiscal second quarter of 2024 (ended Dec. 31). While Microsoft doesn't give individual segment results, its intelligent cloud division (which Azure is a part of) delivered $25.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, making it Microsoft's largest division."", ""Clearly, AI is having a big impact on Microsoft's business right now, and it has done well in positioning itself to take advantage of the move."", 'But is it a good investment?', ""Microsoft undeniably checks the box as an excellent AI company. Its track record and product rollout speak for itself. However, this has caused Microsoft stock to earn a hefty premium compared to other stocks on the market. It's a very expensive stock with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37 and a forward P/E of 35."", 'For reference, AI powerhouse Nvidia trades at a lower forward P/E of 32. This illustrates how high the expectations are for Microsoft and raises some concerns about whether it will be able to hit expectations.', ""From a historical perspective, Microsoft's stock hasn't been this expensive (outside of a few years when its earnings were skewed) since the early 2000s, when Microsoft was caught up in the dot-com crash."", ""I'm not saying Microsoft is due for a crash, but the stock is extremely pricey."", ""So, is Microsoft a good AI investment? I'd say no. The bar is set incredibly high to begin with, which will make it difficult for Microsoft stock to rise significantly."", ""Plus, with Microsoft already making up 7% of the S&P 500, I'm highly exposed to the stock through my 401(k) investments."", ""Microsoft is a great AI company, but its high price tag doesn't make it a great AI investment, at least for right now."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Since the start of 2023, the stock has risen over 440%. Nvidia's sheer size makes this rise even more impressive, as it is now the third-largest U.S. company behind Microsoft and Apple."", ""Because of this unbelievable rise, many investors (including myself) have missed out on some or all of this rise. But that doesn't mean you can't buy now. But should you? Let's find out."", ""Nvidia is at the core of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The computing power required to create advanced AI models is immense, and Nvidia's GPUs are the best in the world at performing this task. GPUs (graphics processing units) were created to process the calculations needed for gaming graphics, but their ability to efficiently process other workloads, like engineering simulations, drug discovery, and mining cryptocurrency, made their usage more widespread."", ""While a single GPU might be used for basic engineering simulations or a gaming computer, complex tasks like AI model training require hundreds or thousands of GPUs. With Nvidia's flagship GPU for data centers (the H100) rumored to cost around $30,000 a piece, it's easy to see why Nvidia's business has taken off with the AI gold rush beginning."", ""Getting the computing power necessary to train AI models is essentially the first task for any company interested in creating its own AI product. Purchasing a dedicated supercomputer isn't necessary for companies; these businesses can also rent computing power from cloud computing giants, who are also building out capacity for computing power that can be rented."", ""As a result, Nvidia's business has boomed, with revenue rising 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. Furthermore, it accelerated 22% from the previous quarter, which shows demand is increasing."", 'But just how long can this demand keep up? That question will determine if investors have missed out on Nvidia.', ""Unfortunately for investors, Nvidia doesn't provide a full-year outlook; management just offers a peek into the next quarter. Still, it gave guidance for revenue of $24 billion, indicating 234% revenue growth. That's an impressive figure and showcases how strong the demand is for GPUs."", 'However, third-party market research firms also believe this demand will persist for many years.', ""Global Market Insights expects the GPU market to reach $400 billion in 2032. With Nvidia posting revenue of $60.9 billion in fiscal year 2024, it's clear that it could continue to rise for some time."", 'This is a positive note for investors, as Nvidia is a hardware company.', ""Because Nvidia's products are one-time buys, purchasing additional GPUs isn't necessary unless a company wants to increase its computing power. This concerns many investors (including myself), as demand for Nvidia's GPUs may drop once initial computing capacity is built out. But with many market research firms confirming that this is just the beginning of the AI boom, it eases my mind to buy Nvidia stock."", ""Additionally, Nvidia's valuation isn't as far-fetched as it once was."", ""When valuing a company going through a massive transformation or growth phase, using the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't wise, as it looks inflated. But if you utilize forward earnings, you can see what the company may look like in one year by utilizing analyst projections instead of older results. This is one situation where forward-looking estimates can be more useful than the proven results of yesteryear."", ""If you do this with Nvidia, its price tag doesn't look too lofty anymore."", ""A forward P/E of 32 isn't that pricey, especially when Microsoft trades for 35 times forward earnings and Apple trades for 28."", ""So, have investors missed the boat on Nvidia stock? Yes. Nvidia won't be able to increase five times in value in just over a year again. But can it be a market-beating investment in the future? I think so."", 'The demand for GPUs will only continue to increase for a while, and Nvidia is set to cash in on this transition.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The most obvious reason is they reduce a company's share price, making the stock more accessible. The less obvious reason is they often spotlight strong businesses. To elaborate, forward stock splits are only necessary after substantial share price appreciation, which rarely happens to mediocre businesses."", 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) are prime examples of that concept in action. Their stock prices have soared 264% and 216%, respectively, over the past five years. In both cases, that price appreciation can be traced back to strong financial results.', ""Those gains made Microsoft and ServiceNow stock split candidates in 2024, but these two companies are worthwhile investments whether or not they split their stocks. Here's why."", 'Microsoft is well known for its Windows operating system, Office productivity software, SQL database, Azure cloud computing services, and Xbox hardware and gaming content. Indeed, the company enjoys a strong presence in each of those product categories, but its most compelling growth prospects lie in enterprise software and cloud computing.', 'Microsoft dominates the software-as-a-service (SaaS) market, earning nearly twice as much revenue as its closest competitor. That success is due to strength in productivity, cybersecurity, and communications applications (i.e., the Microsoft 365 suite) and enterprise resource planning applications (i.e., the Dynamics 365 suite). In a bid to create new revenue streams, the company has launched generative artificial intelligence (AI) copilots that automate workflows across those software products.', 'Meanwhile, Microsoft is gaining market share in cloud computing due in part to strength in artificial intelligence infrastructure and machine learning services. Microsoft Azure accounted for 24% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending in the fourth quarter, up two percentage points from the prior year. Microsoft is well positioned to maintain that momentum due to its exclusive partnership with OpenAI, which lets Azure clients use models like GPT-4, the cognitive engine that powers ChatGPT Plus, to build custom applications.', 'Microsoft reported better-than-expected financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023). Revenue rose 18% year over year to $62 billion on particularly strong momentum in cloud computing. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income soared 26% to $2.93 per diluted share.', 'Turning to the future, SaaS revenue is projected to increase at 13.7% annually through 2030, and cloud computing revenue is projected to grow at 14.1% annually during the same period. That gives Microsoft a good shot at low-double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade. Indeed, Wall Street analysts expect the company to grow sales at 14% annually over the next five years.', 'That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 13.4 times sales appear tolerable, despite being a premium to the three-year average of 11.5 times sales. Patient investors should consider buying a small position in Microsoft today, whether or not the company splits its stock in the near future.', 'ServiceNow helps businesses digitize and streamline processes across disparate departments and software systems. Its platform comprises applications that address four primary use cases: (1) technology workflows like IT service management, (2) customer workflows like customer and field service management, (3) employee workflows like human resources services, and (4) creator workflows like application development and workflow automation.', ""ServiceNow is a recognized leader in several relevant software categories, including enterprise service management, digital process automation, and low-code application development platforms for professional developers. In addition, the company placed No. 19 on the Future 50 list in 2023, an annual report compiled by Fortune and Boston Consulting Group that ranks the world's largest companies based on future growth prospects."", 'ServiceNow reported solid fourth-quarter financial results. Total revenue increased 26% to $2.4 billion and non-GAAP net income jumped 36% to $3.11 per diluted share. In addition, remaining performance obligation -- contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized -- increased 29%, signaling strong top-line momentum in the coming quarters. The company also achieved a renewal rate of 99% in the fourth quarter, up from 98% in the previous year, signaling a high degree of customer satisfaction.', 'Looking ahead, ServiceNow values its addressable market at $220 billion. The company is well positioned to capitalize on that opportunity given its strong presence in multiple software markets and investments in generative AI. To quote CEO Bill McDermott, ""Generative AI is injecting new fuel into our already high-performing engine. ServiceNow\'s intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation is driving massive leaps in productivity and explosive growth. This is a breakthrough moment.""', 'Wall Street expects ServiceNow to grow sales at 20% annually over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 17.6 times sales is tolerable, despite being a slight premium to the three-year average of 16.9 times sales.

Of course. Here are three that might have what it takes.', 'Topping the list is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The company that made former CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer some of the richest men in the world is once again the largest company on the face of the Earth with a market cap topping $3 trillion. And thanks to its many artificial intelligence (AI)-related ventures, Microsoft stands an excellent chance of creating many more fortunes. ', ""Let's start with the company's cloud services business. It's already a massive moneymaker for Microsoft, generating $25.9 billion in its most recent quarter (the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023). That makes it the second-largest cloud services vendor globally, trailing only Amazon Web Services. "", 'As AI usage ramps up, Microsoft stands to benefit from increased cloud services. Indeed, after decelerating some in 2022, cloud spending appears to be reaccelerating as organizations explore how AI can improve their processes and generate efficiencies.', ""In addition, Microsoft's longstanding partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, makes Microsoft a major player in the race to develop the next AI breakthrough. "", ""Finally, Microsoft's often underrated search, news, and advertising segment is gaining market share and growing at close to double-digits, thanks in part to its ChatGPT-powered features, which were added last year."", 'Microsoft has multiple pathways to riches on the AI front. Given its outstanding track record and excellent management, Microsoft could be one AI stock that makes many fortunes going forward.', 'Next is CrowdStrike\xa0(NASDAQ: CRWD). While nowhere near the size of Microsoft, CrowdStrike is still likely to make a number of fortunes in the coming years, thanks to its cutting-edge AI-powered cybersecurity offerings.', ""The company runs perhaps the premier cybersecurity platform available today, which protects networks, endpoints, and data through add-on modules that are tailored to its customers' needs. Its modules are scalable and designed to increase in effectiveness as their data inputs grow larger. In other words, CrowdStrike's product becomes better the longer a customer uses and feeds more data to its AI."", ""What's more, this network effect isn't limited to just one customer. As more organizations adopt CrowdStrike's platform, its AI is able to draw on more scenarios and interactions that help the system detect and prevent unwanted activity across its entire protection umbrella -- similar to the way local law enforcement agencies can rely on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list to be on the lookout for specific individuals they themselves may have never encountered."", 'Financially, CrowdStrike is rocking and rolling. In its most recent quarter (the three months ended Oct. 31, 2023), the company reported $786 million in revenue, up 35% from a year earlier. Moreover, annual recurring revenue (ARR) -- a closely watched metric for companies selling subscription-based products -- increased to $3.15 billion, with $223 million of net new ARR added in the quarter.', 'In short, this means CrowdStrike is growing its subscription base, through bringing in new customers and by upselling additional security modules to existing customers.', ""At any rate, the company's solid growth points to big things ahead, as the number of cyber threats continues to grow -- meaning CrowdStrike's growth curve could extend for many years to come."", ""Last, but by no means least, is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Let's face it: No company or stock has ridden the AI wave better or to greater heights than Nvidia. The company is now America's third-largest public company with a market cap hovering near $2 trillion -- up from $279 billion fewer than 18 months ago."", ""Improbable as it may seem, it's entirely possible that Nvidia could continue its ascent -- even passing Apple and Microsoft to become the largest company globally.

Moreover, estimates of future growth are sky-high."", 'Ultimately, no one really knows how large the AI chip market could get. Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently said it could grow to $400 billion. Perhaps it could be even more.', ""At any rate, it's clear Nvidia has a massive head start over its competitors, and thanks to competitive advantages like its CUDA software, it might maintain those advantages for some time to come.

Ted?"", 'Ted White', ""Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter and Year End 2023 earnings call. I'd like to begin today's call by providing an update on Burke, his commercial launch since our last quarterly earnings call back in November. I'll then ask our Chief Commercial Officer job on a course of to provide a more detailed review of our commercial activities and why can't launch Following Joe's remarks, our Chief Financial Officer, Terry Koehler will review our fourth quarter and year end financial results. We'll then open up the call to take your questions. First and foremost, the organization continues to be focused on our top priority, the launch of Y camp, which is the first and only commercially available FDA approved treatment from Alaskan contagious. And with our first full quarter of commercial operations now complete we're beginning to see traction in many of our targeted dermatology and institutional accounts as we execute our launch plan. Our fourth quarter execution resulted in 1.9 million in why can't net revenue, which we believe demonstrates our continued progress in driving adoption and reflects growing confidence in our prescriber base as we work to expand coverage of Whitecap to over 200 million commercial and Medicaid lives at the end of the year. As a further update on covered lives in December, we agreed to terms and coverage under the medical benefit with two of the largest PBMs. We're working to finalize those agreements. However, coverage under those medical plans became effective on January first, 2024. In addition to expanding our lives covered on January 29th, we announced that the CMS issued a permanent J-code J seven three five four for Whitecap, which is under the health care common procedure coding system process. We expect that J-code for white cans will become fully published on April first, securing that J code for why cancer represents a critical milestone in our commercial strategy has a J-code enables providers to use the same code across all payers for reimbursement. We believe the J code will help grow Why can't utilization among the US Medicaid patient populations and increased overall buy-and-bill account utilization by simplifying the billing and reimbursement process for why can in the fourth quarter, very but also expanded our Why can't product distribution capabilities when we entered into an agreement with Walgreens to distribute. Why can't, through a specialty pharmacy, Walgreens joins versus existing specialty pharmacy new factor who continues to be instrumental in helping the Company distribute, why can't among institutions dermatology and pediatric medical practices. The Walgreens partnership is exciting as we look forward to the opportunity to grow that relationship and leverage Walgreens physical footprint and existing relationships with derm on call to build community awareness and grow treatment rates. On February first, we executed a distribution agreement with DMS. pharmaceutical, the prime vendor to the US Department of Defense to provide why Canada to U.S. military installations around the world. The DMS relationship was in direct response to outreach from the US military treatment facilities, requesting information on how to procure Whitecap for military personnel as the fourth quarter came to a close, we transitioned into the first quarter. We saw wins on the institutional side of our business with major IDNs and hospitals aiding Why can't to formulary and placing orders. We expect these wins to continue as we see more success in our efforts to combat unapproved compounded conservative, along with the anticipate publishing of the J code on April first. And now I'd like to give you an update on our efforts to eliminate the amount of comparative being improperly compounded for the treatment of ALS. As you know, we have consistently taken the position that we intend to fully exercise our legal rights and execute on our multi-prong strategy to clear the market of significant suppliers for unlawfully compounding at there. At the same time, we've cautioned you that we may not see the results of our efforts immediately. Rather, we have said that as the cumulative effects of our plan started to take effect, we'd expect to see noticeable reduction in the availability of competent comparative within a 12 month period of time. Well, we believe we're on track and well on our way to hit our time line. For example, the last five oh three b. pharmacy in the United States on the FDA's outsourcing facility product report to report compounded comparative has discontinued. Compounding can threaten an informed. It's over 400 institutional customers of the availability of lithium. In addition, a number of large national license, Taiwan three pharmacies have also agreed to discontinue compound the comparative consistent with this reduction in the supply of compound to compare it. And we are regularly hearing in the market about the lack of availability of competitive concern and receiving inbound requests for why can't from from providers who are also informing us that they can no longer obtain compounding comparison as we witness the available supply of competitive therapies in the United States significantly decrease. We are further escalating our efforts to ban the EU legal importation of competitive threat and from Canada and specifically the illegal importation of non-FDA approved in certain products from Dormer labs in Canada. Similar to the actionable results we saw from our efforts with the five o. three A. and five O3b pharmacies, we believe that as we continue to execute and escalate our intended strategies, the illegal importation of Ceftaroline from Canada will be discontinued. I'd now like to provide an update on our pipeline on January fifth, we announced that the last patient has been dosed in Part two of the Company's Phase two trial for VP. three one five, a potential first-in-class oncolytic peptide for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma or BCC. Bp-3 one five is a peptide that has been engineered to provide more targeted delivery to stimulate the patient's immune system and destroy cancer cells. We remain excited about the opportunity for this asset, which we view as either a potential nonsurgical alternative to Mohs surgery or as a neoadjuvant chemo therapeutic for a larger base of cell carcinomas, including advanced tumors or non resectable basal cell. The ongoing Phase two trial is a two part open-label multicenter dose escalation proof of concept study with a safety run-in designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of VP. three one five when administered intravitreally with adults with biopsy-proven BCC. The study enrolled 92 adult subjects with a histological diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma in at least one eligible target, least, our interpretation of the data from this study will focus on complete clearance as well as overall tumor shrinkage on patients who may have residual tumors. We expect initial results from the study in the first half of 2024. From an ex-US perspective, in December, we announced that Merck has development and commercialization partner. Turing pharmaceuticals reported positive top line results from its Phase three trial of TO. two zero eight, which is marketed as White Cap in the United States for the treatment of Alaska in Japan. The top line results show that the proportion of subjects achieving complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at the completion of the confirmatory study, the primary endpoint of efficacy was statistically significant versus placebo t. 0 to oh eight demonstrated similar results to white cancer Phase three program and was well tolerated during the study sorry, intends to submit a manufacturing and marketing application for the product in Japan based on the results of the Phase three trial and other studies currently being conducted. In addition to Millennium. As we disclosed on January fourth, we announced alignment with the FDA with respect to the Phase three clinical development plan for Whitecap for the treatment of common warts. Following our Type C meeting. More specifically, we reached agreement with the FDA on the overall design components of a pivotal Phase three study for Whitecap that would support an efficacy supplement for the proposed indication of common warts. We will be seeking additional FDA feedback on our updated clinical design in the second quarter of this year. I'll now turn the call over to Joe by foresight to review our commercial progress. Joe?"", 'Joe Bonaccorso', ""Thanks very much, Ted. As Ted mentioned, we had our first full quarter of commercial operations and we are gaining increasing traction among dermatology practices, pediatricians and institutions. There are a significant and growing interest in prescribing and adopting Whitecap among physicians and broad acceptance on the payer side. We also feel our agreement with DMS and the opportunity with the DoD will further accelerate adoption. Since our last call, insurance coverage of Whitecap has grown significantly. We have increased our number of covered lives from approximately 112 million now over $200 million in both commercial and Medicaid coverage includes major PBMs such as CVSESI. and Optum. I'm pleased to say that our coverage metric has exceeded our internal expectations, and we believe this will ultimately translate into an acceleration in prescription growth of Whitecap over the next several months. In addition, to our market access work. Our sales force reach has expanded over the last five months with over 4,000 health care professionals trained. We are seeing major integrated delivery networks adopt Whitecap with both the Mayo Clinic and Kaiser Permanente day beginning to order products through our distribution partner, Triple-S. We're also continuing to work to gain adoption with private equity-backed dermatology and pediatrician group practices. In support of our field efforts, we have expanded our sales footprint to 53 territories from 50 at launch. We're also adding two additional hospital reps as we continue to focus on driving adoption on the institutional side with HCPs at major IDNs beginning to adopt and with several other significant formulary wins, the incremental hospital reps will be critical in driving demand pulling through orders and maximizing the market opportunity, but also working towards adding two major hospital GPOs and utilize their support to drive further adoption. In addition, we're adding 14 pediatric reps in the first quarter. And so we plan to have a total of 20 pediatric reps in the field by the end of the quarter. Our focus on the pediatric footprint fueled by encouraging inbound traffic, which is consistent with our internal market assessment of the Luscombe diagnosis from pediatric practices across the country due to the size of the pediatric market. Our plan is designed to be efficient around major MSAs, and we will continue to work in coordination with our physician buying group partner, Main Street vaccines and pediatric focused GPOs I also wanted to touch again on the J-code Deco Ted's earlier comments. The receipt of the J-code is expected to be a significant driver of adoption among dermatologists for Whitecap. We believe that the J-code, which is expected to be published on April first, will streamline reimbursement, accelerate benefit verifications and provide consistent reimbursement, which is more challenging with a miscellaneous J-code. We have received supportive feedback from practitioners since we announced our J-code receipt, and we are working hard to educate the market and prepare for our code becoming effective on April 1st of this year. I'll now pass it to Terry to review our fourth quarter and year end financial results."", 'Terry Kohler', ""Very Thanks, Joe. by can't, revenues were $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 with total 2023 revenue for why can't have 4.7 million. This revenue represents the continued fulfillment of ex-factory orders to our distribution partner FFF enterprises as we continue to build awareness, drive adoption and expand insurance coverage and formulary access. In addition, the Q4 units were partially in support of our expanded distribution footprint with the addition of Walgreens as a second specialty pharmacy partner. We also recognized collaboration revenues of 122,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 466,000 for the full year 2023 related to the clinical supply agreement with Tory pharmaceuticals gross product margins for the full year 2023 were 94%, which continued to benefit from certain components of standard cost of goods sold, including bulk production and assembly of applicators from our registration batches having been expensed as R&D prior to approval. Research and development expenses of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 declined versus the third quarter of 2023 by $1.2 million, primarily driven by reduced stock compensation expense. For full year 2023, R & D expenses increased to $20.3 million from $12.2 million in 2022, driven by increased CMC costs related to the preapproval activity, increased clinical trial costs for the B. three one five as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses of 17 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 declined versus the third quarter of 2023 by $3 million, driven primarily by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense. For full year 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $47.3 million from $17.4 million for the full year 2022. The incremental spend was primarily driven by the approval and launch of Whitecap during 2023 and an increase in stock-based compensation expense. Gaap net loss was $67 million or $1.48 per share for fiscal 2023 compared to a GAAP net loss of $24.5 million or $0.72 per share for the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and non-cash interest expense for full year 2023 net loss was $51.8 million or $1.14 per share compared to a net loss of $17.4 million or $0.51 per share in full year 2022. And finally, as of December 31st, 2023, Barrick at aggregate cash and cash equivalents of 69.5 million. The Company expects its cash and cash equivalents as of December 31st, 2023, will be sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2025. And I'll now turn the call back to Ted for closing remarks."", 'Ted White', ""Thanks, Terry. I'm very pleased with the productivity that Bert continues to make across its commercial efforts and our pipeline. We are executing across our entire business, and we believe our success is translating into growing awareness and utilization of Whitecap as the first FDA-approved therapy indicated from Alaska and the only commercially available FDA approved treatments. We continue to forge excellent relationships with dermatology and pediatrician practices, and we believe that our efforts to increase lives under coverage is laying the foundation for the expansive coverage needed to maximize the commercial opportunity for Whitecap. At the same time, we're taking steps to ensure that patients have access to a safe, FDA-approved product. That concludes our formal remarks, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Stacy Ku, TD Cowen', 'Stacy Ku', ""Thanks for taking our questions and congratulations on the nice progress. So we had a few questions. So first, can you provide a little bit more detail around the ITM contribution any insight into additional institutions that are pending? Or are you've added recently to some metrics around that and whether you have a goalpost in mind of additions by year end and seems like some easy kind of low-hanging fruit to really convert understand it takes a little bit of time to it kind of establish the infrastructure. But any details would be really appreciated. That's the first question. And then second question is, can you provide any type of commentary around how clinicians are using, why I can't at this point, so just provide the most updated current split between specialty pharmacy, white bag service versus buy-and-bill. So that's the second question. And then the third is just very early. I know very early, but are you getting a sense of how the adopters are using the product? Are they treating to clear up? Thanks so much."", 'Ted White', ""Thanks for the question, Stacy. I'll turn that over to Joe"", 'Joe Bonaccorso', ""but of course, a morning, Stacy, to answer your first question around the IDNs, we have a obviously a full implemented strategy. It's a great opportunity for why can't we have Kaiser Permanente and Mayo currently ordering. And we got several other IDNs close to, I would say, close to the finish line with formulary approval and expected first order sometime in Q2. We'll continue to look at the and prioritized by the largest opportunity. And then there's other strategies around some of the smaller IDN and health systems throughout the country. Hence, the expansion in the institutional field force to help drive that even more. Our second question around, I believe, was around how the dermatology are split between specialty pharmacy and buy-and-bill. That's as you would expect with a miscellaneous J-code started to be leaning more towards white bag specialty pharmacy with about 80% of the volume going through there and 20% buy-and-bill. And that's a compilation of physician offices in our health systems as well. We expect the buy-and-bill component of this launch to grow the permanent J-Code expected to be published on April first. And then the last question, I believe, was around treat to clear. We're seeing dermatologists following that algorithm to want to treat the patient to clearance and everything we've seen so far. And the anecdotal feedback we've gotten from our customers is pointing in that direction that you'd want to get through a full course of therapy with the patient and obviously their assessment on when they think the patient is cleared and doesn't mean anything else."", 'Stacy Ku', ""Okay. That's helpful. And if I could ask just a quick follow-up on the Adient contribution and what kind of this seems to be kind of bulk orders. So how should we think about the percentage of of this type of contribution in 24 versus some of the as we think about guidance of a consensus of 2024 around 20 million for the year? Thanks so much."", 'Joe Bonaccorso', ""Yes. I think when you look at our hospital opportunity and you look at these facilities as best you can on a on a per patient per month opportunity. So we would think about 30% of our volume should be coming from the institutional side of the business, I would say approximately, that's what we're kind of thinking through right now that may accelerate more as we continue to adopt on the on the J code and you also got to look at this, Stacy as a binary event, right, once we get a facility up and running and committed to using adopting, why can't for your patients, we should be able to count on that repeat business month-over-month."", 'Stacy Ku', 'Very helpful. Thank you.', 'Joe Bonaccorso', ""You're welcome."", 'Operator', 'Gregory Renza, RBC Capital.', ""Hi, guys. It's an issue for Greg. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple from me on how should we be thinking about the current molluscum TAM that remains occupied by treatments such as Curitiba and cryotherapy? And at what pace on a relative or even absolute basis, do you anticipate conversion to white count? And then just really quickly how should we be thinking about sampling of white counts through 4Q and any residual into 2024?"", 'Joe Bonaccorso', ""Thanks again. So I'm sorry, I missed a little bit of your question in the middle there. But I believe you're asking how should we think about your cash and cryosurgery still being used versus why can't you know when when we got into this market it was understood that cure cash, it was probably used about 10% to 15% of the time that it most and cryosurgery was somewhere in that 30% mark of the source of business. So we're continuing to think about it adds. Physicians don't like using cryosurgery, especially on small children. It's very painful. It's technique dependent, and we think we can continue to take from that piece of the pie as well as continue to convert on the compound, the compounding piece of the market and also get new doctors off the sideline. They have not treated without an FDA-approved product that they're ready."", 'Great. Thank you so much. And then just just real quick on that. On the white count sampling, if there was any through 4Q and any into 2024 just for some clarity there.', 'Joe Bonaccorso', ""Sampling you're asking about?"", 'Yes, yes.', ""So we do continue to sample as needed at yields. Sometimes it's just a function of getting our coverage finalized with wherever the insurance company may be for that doctor, we didn't have the permanent J-Code as that comes on board. Now, we expect more and more same day treatment. So that will continue to drive use of samples down and convert to real-time prescription. So it's a very efficiently managed program by us, and we're very judicious in how we go about doing it."", 'Great.', ""Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you for the question."", 'Operator', 'Next question we have is from Oren Livnat of H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.', 'Thanks. I just want to better understand the state of play with coverage. And maybe as it relates to the new J code, you talked about dramatically expanding covered lives numbers, I think to over 200 for nearly doubling quarter over quarter. What does that really mean on the ground? And what does coverage versus headline coverage versus pull through at the office level, does the J code in April mean that it will be really easy for patients and physicians? Are there still prior offs potentially necessary and have their friction? Nice follow-ups.', ""Warren, that Oren, thanks for the question. Yes, as you know, as we're ramping coverage up, right, we have of over 200 million lives now, which is exceptional for a product this young in its life cycle. It's a medical benefit driven product. So you typically see less prior authorizations and you went on. And on the pharmacy benefit side, you'll you'll still have occasionally a prior authorization, which will be the label just the doctor having to put in their notes, the patient was two years of age and older, but to your question. Now we have a J code assigned right that streamlining the reimbursement, a portion of it and have your coverages clean, i.e. No prior authorization. That's going to facilitate same-day treatment for that patient under that insurance company. If there's a prior authorization, they got to just get that cleared and treat. So they have got to submit the paperwork rounding. But having both having this 200 million lives and the J-code now working in simpatico, if you will, should really help accelerate the adoption of why can't even more and just timing there so you mentioned being published April first."", 'I guess. Are there a couple of steps after that with regards to still getting that propagated through EMRs? Or is that how that happens automatically on April first. And then when that there, how much education effort is there still to makes offices aware that there has been a material change in their life is presumably got needs. And so yes, maybe when should we see an acceleration through the year of sale, whether ago?', ""Yes. So just to point, you back, we were awarded the J code in January. So we have started already working through a full a fully baked communication plan with the insurance community and letting them know that the J code was awarded and we're tracking now to see who starting to publish it. Okay. So that is that's been going on since January. We're also working now to work with customers who are either currently buying down the miscellaneous J code or who have expressed interest in coming onboard to buy-and-bill. And the J code was final. And we're working to get those offices set up ahead of Jack of April one. And then as we continue to track towards April one, we got several more communication blast go into the payer community, post-April one, we'll continue to do that just to make sure we have our top 150 payers squared away, and it's always boots on the ground, right? So we have our we have our sales team out there and they're going to continue to make sure that the office is aware of the J-code itself, the J-code number, making sure that they have checked or insurance contracts to what their reimbursement will look like on the ASP. plus side of it. And that's always a deal. This is an account management drug, right? There's always that reinforcement of education and knowledge that we share with customers every time we're in the office in addition to our clinical sites."", ""Okay. And just to pivot real quickly to follow up an earlier question about how docs are using it, what do and I know it's quite early, but what do we know so far about retreatment rates? I know some patients have experienced clearance on one re-treatment. So what are you seeing trend-wise as we've tried to think about how to model this in terms of number average number of treatments per patient and on the insurance side, do you have any reason to believe that retreatments will be treated any differently from a low friction and payer perspective?"", ""Yes. So let me take your last question first, we don't see any impact on insurance reimbursement is what is what you're asking on retreatment, right? They when they approved our product, they knew was it could be up to two applicators per treatment and they knew was for three treatments over 12 weeks. And we haven't seen any real hard cap on the end of the for treatment of somebody did in afib treatment, let's say, right. So no, we don't we don't anticipate friction there from the payer community right now, it's early. But what we're seeing is the typically two applicators per patient plus. We're also early on using samples there, right, Starter doses to get them going as we're building coverage. So the two plus two samples, a pretty good spot to be in and we're tracking towards how we modeled our thoughts around driving demand and what it would look like on a per-patient level as far as the applicator goes."", ""Okay. I'll get back in the queue, if there is a question by me."", 'Thanks.', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question we have is from John surgery of Needham Company.', 'Please go ahead.', ""Hi, everyone. This is John on for Cerj. Congrats on your progress and thank you for taking our question. So regarding the upcoming Type C meeting for why can't label expansion in common warts would you be able to provide any color on the potential design of this trial and whether or not additional trials would be conducted in an external general award and that's include Joe and the investment required and any potential market opportunity for each of these indications? And second, can you provide any insight on how your partnerships with Walgreens is structured and whether we'll see any additional specialty pharmacy partnerships in the future."", 'Ted White', ""So John, thanks for the questions, but first, but I'll turn it over to Gary Goldberg, our Chief Medical Officer."", 'Thanks, Ted. For the Type C meeting follow-up regarding our common warts with the agency. And I think the way that you could think about it is it would be a typical Phase three program that you would expect the agency to ask us sponsored or run on?', 'Joe Bonaccorso', 'We are still in communications and look forward to come to us saying on more as we as we continue to finalize details of the trial design.', ""And then the second, I think the other two questions you had was regarding Walgreens. So Walgreens, the partnership with Walgreens is accelerating nicely as it just to recall why we went to that. That gave us an opportunity to further expand our insurance network within the specialty pharmacy world. Right, adding a second pharmacy Walgreens also has 300 community health system stores, and we're working towards getting those stores staffed with Whitecap. And that will give us a presence across 50 states when that initiative is complete and we're going to start doing that deal sometime later this quarter into the second quarter. And we're always looking at our model, right? So what we really want to do here is be operationally efficient, and we want to think about ways to continue to ramp this acceleration. So your other question regarding potentially adding another specialty pharmacy, we'll continue to assess that and see if there's a need to further strengthen our footprint and help accelerate business. So that's constantly under review by us."", 'Operator', 'The next question we have is from Kemp Dolliver of Brookline Capital. Please go ahead.', ""Great. Thank you and good morning. So two questions. First, what the model for the pediatric sales force? I think I've seen it various times you? Well, we're going to have, I think, a part time pediatric sales force. And then I think I've also seen that this may be evolved to where today these are full-time hires with probably a compensation model that looks like the dermatology team?"", 'Yes.', ""So great question. Um, you know, we were looking at a variety of models in pediatrics known that we had to get there. But based on the inbound traffic, we continue to get to the office and what we're hearing on the ground, we made the decision to step that would a full-time compensated field force. So we'll be building the team now down to 20 representatives and they will be hitting the ground in full April first. So we think there's a strong market opportunity with pediatricians, and we've decided to make that a full effort to go after it. Okay. That's very helpful. And then the second question relates to sampling and just when we when you look at yourself, the sell-through data from triple F, how much of that volume is sampling and how much of that so far is that is reimbursed business so when we look at sampling, that's on a that's in a different lane for us, right? We're not we're not looking at that as our pull through from 3F. So sampling has just been on an as-needed basis based on the opportunity with the physician if they were looking to treat the same day. Well, while we were getting our insurance coverage built out of the use and the white-box specialty more a pharmacy that has no no bearing on what we're doing at 3F as far as our revenue drives. Okay. But just as a percent just looking at the overall activity and are we looking at 80 90% sampling at this stage or a lower number? I'm sorry, I didn't catch less than your question? Well, let me rephrase it. What's what percentage of the volume so far is?"", 'Yes.', ""So what we typically do is an outright. I don't have an approximate percent for you but what I would say to you, the samples were have been tapering down significantly since we first launched the product in September October, right? So meaning that September, we were probably at our highest trying to get some of trial use and then now we're bringing it down. So I would say it's roughly maybe 5%, five, 6% of our activity out there is driven by sampling."", 'Terry Kohler', ""That's perfect."", 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Well, the next question we have is a follow-up question from Ari LoopNet of H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.', ""So just a couple of squeezing on, I guess to build on Ken's question, maybe a different way to look at it and everybody is getting at is can you comment on gross to nets ultimately you talked about Medicaid as an important part of the business. And is it a new specialty pharmacy networks? Where does that shake out now and going forward?"", 'Terry Kohler', ""Morning, thanks, Lorne. Gross aggressiveness to date have been very consistent with our expectations prelaunch. So going forward, we continue to expect that net sales as a percentage of gross sales is going to be in that 45% to 50% range, but there might be some lumpiness in that number throughout the year, just depending on where patients are in their deductibles, but very consistent with what we we are we thought prelaunch and you expect that to improve as coverage and contracting come down through the year. And what's the sort of terminal sustainable gross-to-net near-mine we would expect an improved focus coverage comes on and we have less impact to our co-pay program for insured now covered as well as as we transition more business to buy-and-bill which is favorability from a distribution standpoint. So you're probably even closer to 50%, the higher end of that range that I gave you once we get to a normal state Okay."", ""And lastly, are you expecting significant response from the FDA in March to the Citizen's Petition? How big a deal is this imported business now? And do you think they're going to just kick the can on and on a delayed response, are you expecting something material and what might be the next?"", ""Yes, warn us that we don't expect them to kick the can have their response due in April, we continue to have outreach with the FDA regarding our concerns, and we fully expect to respond to them right."", ""But today, I do think they actually do anything or are they going to acknowledge your concern and we'll keep it at that."", 'Kevin Gardner', ""If I if I knew that I'd win the lottery system of processes until we think we made a very strong argument in our citizen's petition, there is precedent for what we're asking for, and we hope that the FDA rules in our favor, but obviously, I can't predict what they're going to do, but we're confident, but we will be successful one way or the other."", 'Okay.', 'Thanks so much.', 'Operator', 'Yes, there are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Ted White for closing comments.', 'Ted White', ""Thank you, operator. So I'd like to thank all of you for joining us this morning. We're obviously very pleased with the significant accomplishments in 2023 and the progress we expect to make in 2024.

Meanwhile, the company's expanding margins should support 15%-plus annual growth in earnings per share (EPS)."", "" Earnings growth should enable Starbucks to continue increasing its dividend at a healthy pace. Given that robust growth, even if the valuation multiple continues contracting, it could still produce total annualized returns in the mid-teens from here. That's an excellent return from such a high-quality company. "", 'Verizon is a cash flow machine.

Indeed, the upstart coffee chain faces heavy competition, and its stock price has shown few signs of recovery from the 2022 bear market."", ""Nonetheless, Dutch Bros continues to grow despite the headwinds. Also, when considering three of the companies' attributes, investors could take more of an interest."", ""The best reason to buy Dutch Bros stock right now is its fortuitous position in the market. Admittedly, many investors may not see it that way due to the competition, and its peers are not just Starbucks and CosMc's. Numerous independents and small chains continue to succeed in this business."", 'However, Dutch Bros is in the midst of a regional-to-national expansion, a factor that served Starbucks shareholders well in the 1990s. As of the end of 2023, Dutch Bros spanned 16 states and over 831 shops, a nearly 24% increase in the number of locations in just one year.', ""Even though same-shop sales rose by only 3%, the company's revenue increased by 31% during the same period to $966 million. Also, its pace of expansion is unlikely to slow anytime soon. The company expects to add at least 150 shops in 2024, meaning massive revenue growth is likely, even if same-shop sales stay in the low single digits. That could serve as a catalyst that will finally help Dutch Bros recover from the previous bear market."", ""When considering the company's potential to expand to the other 34 states (and possibly beyond), Dutch Bros could maintain this growth pace for years."", 'Additionally, the rise in revenue led to a milestone Dutch Bros had not previously experienced as a public company -- profitability.', 'To be sure, its net income in 2023 was modest, just $1.7 million. Moreover, it came thanks to positive net income in the second and third quarters. In those quarters, limiting the increases in the cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses allowed for enough operating income to turn profitable.', 'Still, continued growth in revenue should increase profit growth. More importantly, a positive income means Dutch Bros can devote profits and any outside funding to expansion. This is critical because the number of outstanding shares rose from 58 million in the middle of last year to more than 81 million today, a level of increase that makes share price growth difficult.', 'Nonetheless, since the company paid off a $203 million line of credit in the second half of 2023, its remaining total debt of about $99 million is only about 15% of its $676 million in total equity. That could mean it turns to debt rather than issuing new shares to fund its expansion.', 'Furthermore, share prices have not recovered from the 2022 bear market. Admittedly, fears about rising prices and a slumping economy may have cooled investors to Dutch Bros. However, the company was losing money at that time and had a smaller store footprint.', 'Also, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has dropped below 1.9. In comparison, Starbucks sells for around 2.9 times sales. Additionally, the average P/S ratio for the S&P 500 is about 2.8, a metric that factors many value stocks into the mix. This could indicate Dutch Bros stock is undervalued as it is clearly a growth stock.', 'Amid intense competition, Dutch Bros continues to stand out among coffee stocks. The company continues to benefit from a regional-to-national expansion, a trend that benefited Starbucks and other retail businesses before it. Moreover, Dutch Bros is on track to continue its rapid growth after recently achieving profitability.', ""Indeed, the company needs to significantly slow the growth of outstanding shares.

A spokeswoman for Starbucks said Craig “was separated from our store for clear violations of established cash-handling and workplace violence policies and failure to adhere to store alarm protocols,” not in retaliation for union activities.', 'Beyond Starbucks, a national bargaining process would mark a significant milestone for nascent efforts to organize the service sector.', '""No other chain has had something like this, but we have to understand that there\'s no other chain that\'s been organized in so many different places so rapidly,"" said Ileen DeVault, a professor of labor history at Cornell\'s School of Industrial and Labor Relations.', ""In recent years, union-backed organizing groups such as Fight for $15, which focuses on fast food workers, and OUR Walmart have sought to pressure major companies to engage in large-scale bargaining by staging strikes and protests and filing legal complaints against employers. But those efforts, including at fast food giant McDonald's, have largely stalled."", 'Newer campaigns, including efforts to organize workers at Starbucks, Amazon.com, sporting goods retailer REI and Wells Fargo, have largely focused on unionizing individual workplaces.', 'DeVault said a national bargaining table would be beneficial for both sides, considering the hundreds of sites.', '""It\'s not like Starbucks has a whole troupe of labor relations people who can run out to these different locations and bargain.""', 'DeVault said similar arrangements have been made outside of retail and food industries. Last year the Teamsters, the union representing roughly 340,000 UPS workers, ratified a master contract alongside local supplemental agreements.', 'Lane Windham, a labor historian and professor at Georgetown University, and a former labor organizer, said U.S. contract negotiations function differently than in many other countries, usually through individual workplaces.', 'Other countries such as Germany and France tend to have sectoral bargaining, Windham said, where unions negotiate contracts with employers across an entire industry.', '""It\'s been a long time since we\'ve seen something like this, and certainly never in the service sector,"" Windham said. But, she continued, ""It hasn\'t actually happened yet.""', '(Reporting by Waylon Cunningham in San Antonio, Texas, and Daniel Wiessner in Albany, NY; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Nick Zieminski)']"

Monster Beverage reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$7.1b and statutory earnings per share of US$1.54, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Monster Beverage ', ""Following the latest results, Monster Beverage's 22 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$7.97b in 2024. This would be a solid 12% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to grow 16% to US$1.82. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$8.01b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.82 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$63.70, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic Monster Beverage analyst has a price target of US$72.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$50.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure."", ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2024 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 12% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 13% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 5.0% annually. So although Monster Beverage is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

helpful when you're using points."", 'ERIC ROSEN: Absolutely.', 'Those are great pieces of advice.', 'Airlines open up their award availability about 331 days in advance.', 'It seems to be typical among US airlines.', ""Some don't schedule quite that far out."", ""So if you know your plans well in advance, that's when you'll find that award availability."", ""But also, to her point, if you're flexible, you can find some last-minute deals."", ""As airlines find they have unsold seats, they'll open those up for award availability."", 'You can put those miles to use.', 'You might just end up flying, you know, on a Wednesday night instead of a Friday night, things like that.', ""So, the more you can be flexible, the more likely you're going to be able to put your points in miles to use."", 'MADISON MILLS: And I know part of the advice is to utilize price alerts and to, you know, again, be flexible.', 'To your point, Eric, is there a moment though where you advise people to go ahead and pull the trigger and not continue to hold and wait?', ""ERIC ROSEN: If you've been tracking prices and they're within your budget, I would say just book the flight then."", ""As you get closer and closer to the departure time, chances are those prices aren't going to drop."", ""You won't see a precipitous $500 to $200 drop on the airfare that you're going for."", ""So if it fits within your budget, you've got a limited amount of vacation days, the kids are off of school, don't wait too long to book your trip."", ""That said, if things really aren't in your budget, you might want to save it for a later vacation sort of like she had mentioned, where instead of going on your spring break now, think about an early summer trip before everyone's out of school, or towards the end of summer

these-- who is best served by getting these points situations and cards and using them?', 'ERIC ROSEN: Absolutely.', ""You know, airline programs, hotel programs do a really good job at making it seem very complicated to use their miles or saying that like, you just need to rack up some miles and you'll get a free flight."", ""And then you go to look and you're not able to find the thing that you actually need."", 'If you want to keep things simple, there are a lot of ways you can do it, right?', ""Get a solid cashback card like the Chase Freedom, right, so you can earn points on every purchase and then use those points for cashback, whether it's on travel expenses or on something else."", ""We also suggest going for transferable points, something like Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, Capital One miles, where you can redeem them at a set rate for things like flights and hotels so you don't really have to do a ton of mental calculations in order to get some value."", ""Or you can transfer them to a variety of different airline and hotel partners that suit your need at a particular time, rather than having to stick to one program that might change its rules on a dime and leave you without enough miles for that trip you've been having your eye on for the last couple of months."", 'MADISON MILLS: All right.', ""Eric, one final question here for the users out there who have been utilizing credit card points, I'm wondering about the kind of transfer deals that come up from time to time."", 'What is the best way for folks to stay on top of those potential opportunities, and capitalize on them at the right times?', 'ERIC ROSEN: Definitely.', ""So when you're talking about are transfer bonuses, where instead of like one Amex point to one British Airways miles or one delta mile, for instance, you might get a 25% bonus."", ""So if you transfer 1,000 of them, you'll get 1,250 miles instead of the usual 1,000."", 'The best way to stay on top of those is to follow sites like ours, The Points Guy, because we have regular updates of what transfer bonuses are currently out there.', ""And I would say don't go speculatively transferring all of your points from those programs all at once because you should have a specific imminent redemption in mind where you can really take advantage of that extra value, rather than counting on something coming down the pike in a few months time."", ""Because like I said, programs can change, or that hotel that's in one category of award redemption today could go up the next day and then you've

The actual value of the load factor was a tad less than our projection of 80.2%.Total operating costs (on a reported basis) edged up 0.9% to $2.39 billion, mainly due to a 9% gain in expenses on salaries, wages and benefits.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.13 billion, indicating growth of 4.3% from that reported in the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at 56 cents per share, suggesting growth of 19.2% from the year-ago period’s reported number. Earnings estimates for the fiscal third quarter have been unchanged in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the trailing four quarters, BF.B delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3%, on average.', '\xa0', 'Brown-Forman Corporation price-eps-surprise | Brown-Forman Corporation Quote', 'Brown-Forman has been witnessing strong sales trends, driven by increased demand for its brands, and growth across all geographic clusters and the Travel Retail channel. This has been driving organic sales growth.Also, BF.B has been benefiting from the success of its portfolio premiumization strategy, pricing initiatives, revenue growth management strategies and aggressive brand investments. Gains across its premium and super-premium brands have been contributing to its top-line growth.The company is likely to have witnessed continued growth across brands and categories in the fiscal third quarter. Strength in the Jack Daniel’s family of brands and the momentum in Ready-to-Drink (RTD) have been key drivers. Sales in the fiscal third quarter are expected to have gained from the continued consumer interest in flavor and convenience, aiding the performances of Jack Daniel’s RTD, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire.BF.B has also been on track with its pricing strategy, which aims to increase prices year over year to grow sales as part of its revenue growth management initiatives. Gains from improved pricing are likely to get reflected in the company’s top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected to deliver solid organic sales growth throughout fiscal 2024, driven by its pricing and revenue growth management strategies, and portfolio premiumization. The persistence of these trends is likely to have aided the company’s performance in the fiscal third quarter.Our model predicts the tequila category to register sales growth of 8.9% in the fiscal third quarter. Meanwhile, other key categories, including wine, vodka and RTD, are likely to report sales growth of 26.9%, 3.6%, and 21.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, the whiskey category is expected to witness a decline of 1.3%.However, Brown-Forman has been witnessing several headwinds, including higher input costs due to inflation, tough distributor inventory comparisons and rising advertising expenses due to investments in its brands.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected inflation to continue affecting input costs throughout fiscal 2024. Higher inflation is expected to have slightly hurt the gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter, offset by the benefits of the easing supply-chain disruption-related costs and lower tariff-related costs due to the removal of the U.K. tariffs on American whiskey.Our model predicts a gross margin of 61.3%, suggesting a 360-bps expansion from the year-ago quarter’s actual.The company has been witnessing higher advertising expenses due to continued investments in its brands. This is likely to have partly dented margins and the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Elevated advertising costs are likely to have resulted from the increased promotions for its brands.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected SG&A expense growth to remain higher than historical averages through the rest of fiscal 2024 due to expectations of higher compensation-related expenses and expenses related to the transition to own distribution in Japan. This is expected to get reflected in the SG&A expenses for the fiscal third quarter.We expect advertising expenses to increase 0.7% year over year to $142 million in the fiscal third quarter, along with a 5.1% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.', 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Brown-Forman this time around.

But videos of young people popping the pouches have racked up millions of views on TikTok and other social media platforms.', 'That trend has advocates worried that Zyn could become the latest nicotine product to attract underage teens, similar to the way Juul triggered a yearslong spike in vaping. Other experts say that risk is outweighed by the potential to steer adults away from cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products, which account for 480,000 U.S. deaths annually.', '“The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result,” said Dr. Jasjit Ahluwalia, an addiction specialist at Brown University. “That is what we’ve done with tobacco for decades. We’ve been all about abstinence, instead of embracing products that can reduce harm.”', 'Ahluwalia sees nicotine pouches and e-cigarettes as a way to help smokers cut back or quit cigarettes.', 'That approach is standard practice in the U.K., but it’s outside the medical mainstream in the U.S., where only pharmaceutical-grade medications like nicotine gum and lozenges are formally approved to help smokers quit.', 'Ahluwalia points out that Zyn works the same way as those products: releasing low levels of nicotine that are absorbed into the gums, reducing cravings. The chief difference, he notes, is that Zyn is sold by Philip Morris, the global cigarette giant and a longtime foe of anti-smoking groups.', ""The controversy around Zyn recently spilled over into politics, pitting Democrats and Republicans in Washington against each other and spiraling into another skirmish in the nation's culture war."", 'In late January, Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, of New York, called on regulators to investigate Zyn, citing its appeal to teens. Several House Republicans then warned constituents that “Big Brother” intended to “ban nicotine.”', 'Conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, a Zyn user, jumped into the fray, declaring: “Zyn is not a sin,” and touting its unproven benefits, like “enhancing male vitality and mental acuity.”', 'Zyn users have quickly developed their own online vocabulary, including “zynnies,” “zynner” and “zynsky.""', '“There’s this online subculture around Zyn that’s been spearheaded by younger males, but a lot of that’s not coming from the brand itself,” said Ollie Ganz, a Rutgers University tobacco and nicotine researcher.', 'Online videos show young people documenting their first experiences trying Zyn, reviewing different flavor combinations and displaying heaping piles of used canisters.', '“It’s concerning to see the countless Zyn-related memes and hashtags that are being amplified and normalized across social media,” said Kathy Crosby, CEO of the Truth Initiative, an anti-tobacco advocacy group.', 'Truth and other groups point to research suggesting nicotine can interfere with brain development in adolescents.', 'It’s the Food and Drug Administration’s job to weigh Zyn’s risks to youngsters against its potential to help adults.', 'In a statement, an FDA spokesman said the agency is monitoring underage use, noting that 1.5% of high school and middle schoolers reported using pouches last year. That’s well below the 10% who used e-cigarettes.', 'FDA officials have allowed Zyn to stay on the market while they review Philip Morris’ marketing application, which has been pending since 2020. If teen use remains low, the company could win FDA authorization for at least some of its offerings, which come in multiple strengths and flavors.', 'In 2019, the FDA awarded its first-ever reduced risk designation to a similar product: snus, a tobacco pouch popular in Sweden that contains lower levels of carcinogens than cigarettes. The FDA said smokers who switch to snus reduce their risk of lung cancer, bronchitis and other diseases.', 'Zyn excludes the tobacco leaves found in snus, leaving only nicotine, which Philip Morris says increases its appeal.', '“People can be reluctant to move into an oral tobacco product if they view it as similar to traditional chewing tobacco,” company spokesman Corey Henry said. “Consumer acceptability is a big part of Zyn.”', 'Philip Morris doesn’t use online influencers or endorsements to promote Zyn, Henry said. Its website is restricted to adults 21 and older. And flavors like cinnamon and peppermint are “familiar to adults,” Henry said.', 'Zyn launched in the U.S. in 2014, but sales have exploded in the past year, generating $1.8 billion as shipments accelerated year-over-year by over 60%.', 'On a November call with retailers, one company executive called the growth “gonzo” and “lights out.”', '“I didn’t see this coming. I don’t know anyone who did,” said Joseph Teller, a director for oral tobacco products.', ""Zyn promotions emphasize the pouches' discreet, convenient nature as a “smoke-free,” “spit-free” alternative for smokers “at work” or “on the move.”"", 'But to fulfill the company’s stated goal of a “smoke-free future,” Zyn will need to help users fully switch from cigarettes, rather than alternating between the two.', 'There’s little data on switching, and preliminary research suggests pouches may not be a great substitute.', 'Ohio State University researchers recently found it took smokers 30 minutes to an hour to get enough nicotine from Zyn to relieve their cravings. With cigarettes, smokers achieved the same nicotine levels — and relief — in five minutes.', '“The pouches we studied, especially the lower nicotine concentrations, did not appear to meet the needs of smokers,” said Brittney Keller-Hamilton, who led the study. “That being said, they didn’t totally flop either.”', 'For now, smokers who have had success with Zyn say they hope it stays available.', 'Justin Wafer, 39, was smoking a pack a day last spring while working as a bartender in Portland, Oregon. On busy days, he would also vape if he didn’t have time to step away for a smoke break.', 'But after his reloadable electronic cigarette broke in May, he decided to try Zyn. These days, he usually pops a pouch every three to four hours and says he hasn’t smoked in more than nine months.', '“I don’t see how it’s any different from pharmaceutical solutions like lozenges or gum,” he says. “Except it’s easier to get and tastes better.”', '___', 'The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with VST.', ""On February 29, 2024, Packaging Corp of America (NYSE:PKG) released its 10-K filing, providing a comprehensive overview of the company's financial and operational performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. As a leading manufacturer in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry, PKG reported a strong financial year with net sales in the Packaging segment totaling $7.1 billion. The company's strategic focus on smaller customers and operational flexibility has allowed it to carve out a significant 10% share of the domestic containerboard market. With a record production of 4.5 million tons of containerboard and 60.5 billion square feet of corrugated products sold, PKG demonstrates its capacity to meet high demand and maintain a robust supply chain. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by the latest SEC filings, providing investors with a clear picture of PKG's market position and future prospects."", ""Market Position and Production Capacity: Packaging Corp of America (NYSE:PKG) has solidified its position as the third-largest containerboard producer in the United States, with a significant market share of approximately 10%. The company's impressive production capacity, which reached 4.5 million tons of containerboard in 2023, demonstrates its ability to meet the high demand for corrugated packaging products. PKG's focus on smaller customers gives it a competitive edge, allowing for a more personalized service and flexibility in operations. This strategic approach has contributed to the company's robust financial performance, with the Packaging segment alone generating $7.1 billion in net sales."", ""Operational Efficiency and Sustainability: PKG operates with a high degree of operational efficiency, as evidenced by its 86 corrugated manufacturing and protective packaging operations. The company's commitment to sustainability is also a key strength, with products made from renewable raw materials and a significant portion of energy derived from biogenic fuels. PKG's sustainable practices not only appeal to environmentally conscious consumers but also align with global trends towards sustainable development."", ""Dependence on Economic Cycles: The packaging industry is highly cyclical, and PKG's financial performance is susceptible to fluctuations in the broader economy. As noted in the 10-K filing, the first half of 2023 saw a deterioration in operating conditions for the Packaging business due to economic downturns and lower demand. While demand rebounded in the second half, such volatility highlights the company's exposure to economic cycles, which could lead to unpredictable financial performance."", ""Cost Inflation and Supply Chain Risks: PKG faces challenges related to cost inflation, particularly in production and transportation. The company's reliance on various raw materials, such as wood fiber and chemicals, subjects it to price fluctuations that can impact profitability. Additionally, transportation costs and availability pose a risk, as experienced with truck and rail service issues. These factors can lead to increased operational costs and potentially hinder PKG's ability to distribute products efficiently."", 'Expansion into New Markets: PKG has the opportunity to expand its customer base and enter new markets. With a strong production capacity and a focus on smaller customers, the company can leverage its flexibility to cater to niche markets and diversify its revenue streams. Additionally, the growing demand for sustainable packaging solutions presents an opportunity for PKG to capitalize on its environmentally friendly product offerings.', ""Technological Advancements: The adoption of new technologies in manufacturing and logistics can lead to increased efficiency and cost savings for PKG. Innovations in production processes and supply chain management can enhance the company's competitive advantage and allow for better response to customer needs and market changes."", ""Competitive Pressure: PKG operates in a highly competitive industry, with major players like International Paper and WestRock Company posing significant threats. The company must continuously innovate and improve its product offerings and customer service to maintain its market position. Additionally, competition from overseas producers, influenced by trade policies and currency exchange rates, can impact PKG's market share and profitability."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Risks: The packaging industry is subject to stringent environmental regulations, which can lead to increased compliance costs and operational restrictions for PKG. Changes in environmental policies or the introduction of new regulations could impact the company's manufacturing processes and cost structure. Moreover, any environmental incidents or non-compliance could result in fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage."", ""In conclusion, Packaging Corp of America (NYSE:PKG) exhibits a strong market position with significant production capacity and a focus on sustainability. However, the company must navigate economic cyclicality, cost inflation, and competitive pressures to maintain its financial health. Opportunities for expansion and technological advancements present potential growth avenues, while regulatory and environmental risks require vigilant management. Overall, PKG's strategic focus and operational strengths position it well to capitalize on market opportunities and mitigate potential threats."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

As a result, readers should always check whether Perrigo has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' View our latest analysis for Perrigo ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Perrigo reported a loss after tax last year, which means it's paying a dividend despite being unprofitable. While this might be a one-off event, this is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term. Considering the lack of profitability, we also need to check if the company generated enough cash flow to cover the dividend payment. If Perrigo didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 46% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", 'Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective.

It sort of decays very steeply and then flattens over time. The more months you\'re paying for the service, you\'re less likely to cancel. So that month zero to month three window is super fragile and important for these services to really win that customer. And what we found is that there\'s a high amount of subscriptions held in those early tenure periods. If you look at the nine biggest services, 39% of subscriptions that we measure are in their first year of tenure and if you remove Netflix (NFLX) from that calculation, it goes up to 45% so nearly half of subscriptions are in their first year of tenure and that\'s really when you\'re most at risk to cancel.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", 'AKIKO FUJITA: Well, it has been a choppy ride for the streaming industry, from cracking down on password sharing to additional price hikes, consumers wary of seeing their streaming bills rise are starting to push back.', ""More than 140 million subscribers canceled their streaming subscriptions last year. That's the most cancellations in five years. But roughly a quarter of customers resubscribe within three months of cancelling their subscription, according to an Antenna report."", ""For a deeper dive on the study, we are joined by Brendan Brady. He is Antenna strategy director. Brendan, this is a fascinating study. It answers many of the questions we've had about these streaming sites. So let's talk first about the cancellations that these sites saw."", ""How much of that is about customers becoming a little more cost conscious? How much of this is about just the sheer number of services that are out there, customers just can't keep up?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: I think it's the latter more than anything. there's. More choice than ever in terms of where you can access premium film and television content. There's also no switching costs associated with streaming. You can cancel a service in one, two, maybe three clicks."", ""And so we're seeing the consumer become more habituated to moving of in and out of these services. And that's been the primary driver of this increase in churn that we've seen as of late."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. We're talking about cancellations. But what your study also found that a lot of those customers do come back. So let's talk about the churn. How quickly is that churn happening right now? And who's most affected by it?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: So if we look at the consumer behavior around re-subscription, which is a core metric of ours here at Antenna, it's really on the rise, the behavior, overall, of canceling a service first, but then also adding it back."", ""And so if we look at the nine biggest streaming services in the US, 25% of customers are coming back within three months after canceling. Fast forward to 12 months, and it's about 40% of customers."", 'We see that Peacock and Netflix, actually, in this past year, saw the highest instance of winning back those customers at a quick rate. And I think a lot of it is driven by content. So maybe you subscribe to Peacock to watch ""Sunday Night Football,"" when the season kicks off. And then when the season ends, you might cancel, but you come back.', 'And we really see that the consumer is getting increasingly comfortable with moving in and out of these services with a lot more rigor.', ""AKIKO FUJITA: And Brendan, any sense on what some of those shows are or those offerings are that bring the consumers back, at least, brought them back, if you're looking at 2023 data?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: I think it's hard to say a specific title, just given that everyone has different tastes. But, overall, we certainly do see that the consumer will cancel, but then they'll also come back. And the implication there is that services now have to begin to manage these customers, not only over a single lifetime, but, really, think about their relationship with that platform more holistically."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: What's interesting to me, though, even though we're talking about re-subscriptions or re-subscribers, however you want to use the term, it is still also, for these brands or platforms, all about getting the new subscribers on board to, at least, lock them in to these services."", ""What did your study find about how that strategy is working? That three-month window you talk about to me is so fascinating, because have to wonder what the calculation is among those customers who've signed up to say, is this something that's worth keeping?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: So if you take a cohort of consumers, and you see how they decay or cancel over time, it's not linear. It decays very steeply. And then flattens over time. The more months that you're paying for the service, you're less likely to cancel."", ""And so that month zero to month three window is super fragile and important for these services to really win that customer. And what we've found is that there's a high amount of subscriptions held in those early tenure periods. If you look at the nine biggest services, 39% of subscriptions that we measure are in their first year of tenure."", ""And if you remove Netflix from that calculation, it goes up to 45%. So nearly half of subscriptions are in their first year of tenure. And that's really when you're most at risk to cancel. And so it's really important for these services to consider, who is that subscriber? What else are they paying for? What else are they watching? And really try to manage them so that they can get them past that fragile period and more towards the area of the survival curve, where things start to flatten out."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Brendan, what's the threshold for the average customer? Is it three platforms, three subscriptions, four subscriptions? What did you find?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: I can't give an absolute number. But if we look at it broadly, we see that the subscriptions per subscriber is consistently growing. At the same time, churn is increasing."", ""And so maybe you have three subscriptions in a given month. And the next month, you have two. or the next month, you have one. And maybe, the next month after that, you have five. We're in a world where there's virtually no switching costs associated with this, which is quite unlike cable, where you had to call someone, they would have to pick up your box, and so on."", 'And so we really see that the consumer is adding services strongly, but also canceling services with the same amount of strength.']"

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?"", ""Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Netflix (NFLX)."", 'Netflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.96, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.96 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 55% and 2.5% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLX', 'Check price target & stock forecast for Netflix here>>>The ABR suggests buying Netflix, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Should You Invest in NFLX?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6% over the past month to $17.03.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Netflix.

Investors are being rewarded for putting their money behind top growth stocks, and it looks like the trend could continue in the remainder of this year and beyond.', 'With that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors believe that you should be loading up on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) this March.', ""Keith Noonan (Nvidia): One of the market's hottest stocks is Nvidia, and the artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price has surged 60% across roughly two months of trading in 2024. Over the last year, the stock is up 240%."", ""With that kind of incredible performance, it's not unreasonable to wonder whether the company's valuation has been pushed into bubble territory. While these strong gains for the stock could open the door for some valuation volatility, there are actually good reasons to think that Nvidia is still in the relatively early stages of a massive long-term bull run."", ""In the fourth quarter, it recorded adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on sales of $22.1 billion. The company's data center segment was once again the standout, with surging demand for advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) capable of powering AI applications helping push sales up 409% year over year. With $18.4 billion in sales, the data center segment accounted for roughly 83% of overall revenue."", ""Nvidia's largest business segment is also by far its fastest growing -- a dynamic that helps set the stage for fantastic growth overall. Last quarter, the GPU leader's sales soared 265% year over year, and its adjusted EPS jumped 486%. The incredible growth looks poised to continue."", ""For this year's first quarter, Nvidia expects to post sales of roughly $24 billion -- good for growth of roughly 234% year over year. Notably, the AI leader has actually been quite conservative with its guidance lately, and overall demand trends continue to look highly favorable. It wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia significantly exceed its first-quarter sales target."", ""Crucially, the pieces appear to be in place for incredible wins to keep piling up over the long haul. While the rise of AI is already having world-shaking implications, the technology is still in a relatively nascent state. We're still just starting to see what's possible with the tech, and Nvidia's hardware is going to play a central role in AI's next stages."", 'Even better, the company is also making big pushes in AI software and computing as a service -- categories that are likely to create high-margin recurring revenue streams.', 'For long-term investors looking to profit from the rise of AI, Nvidia stock is still a top buy.', 'Parkev Tatevosian (Netflix): In the last several years, Netflix has demonstrated a lot. For one, it fended off fierce competition from legacy content companies jumping into the streaming industry.', 'And it has proved it can create content that hundreds of millions of folks are willing to pay premium prices for. Lastly, it has done all of this while growing profitability.', 'Lockdowns imposed by governments in response to the outbreak of COVID helped to launch streaming services, with people spending more time at home. Existing streaming services doubled down, adding more premium content, with increased advertising to support the services. Despite that onslaught, Netflix remains the top streaming content provider when measured by subscribers.', 'Moreover, as competitors dived into the industry, they held back content they were previously willing to license to Netflix. That was a challenge it overcame. Stranger Things, Squid Game, Bridgerton, and more are some of the most popular shows on video streaming, and they were all created by Netflix.', 'This capability to create hit content could pay dividends for decades. Most impressively, Netflix achieved all this while maintaining -- and even growing -- profitability. Its operating income jumped from $2.6 billion in 2019 to $6.9 billion in 2023.', ""As of this writing, the stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27. That is lower than where it was in 2021, when its dominance over the streaming industry's latest entrants was less evident."", 'For those reasons, investors can buy Netflix stock in bunches in March before the market realizes what a powerhouse the streaming pioneer has become.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

But hints of Netflix 3.0 are apparent in the business segments in which it’s investing. At its core, the strategy involves expanding the Netflix universe beyond its current catalog of streaming content by offering live experiences, products, and games, as well as developing new forms of distribution and monetization.', 'To execute this strategy, Netflix is tapping longtime company veterans as well as new recruits with specialized skills and experiences. Fortune took a look at Netflix’s newest businesses and projects, and at the insiders leading the charge. Here are some of the key people building the next version of Netflix.', 'Title: Vice President, Nonfiction Series', 'Year joined Netflix: 2016', ""As vice president of unscripted, documentary, and sports series, Brandon Riegg manages all nonfiction material in Netflix's content slate. Titles that fall under his purview include Queer Eye, Formula 1: Drive to Survive, and Take Care of Maya. In recent years, Riegg’s responsibilities have grown with Netflix’s expansion into live programming."", 'Riegg leads the division working on live specials like the Chris Rock stand-up show and the Love Is Blind reunion, the latter of which faced technical difficulties that halted the program. He also oversees Netflix’s foray into live sports programming, which includes last year’s golf tournament between Formula 1 drivers and PGA tour golfers, and the upcoming tennis match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz.', ""Riegg’s television expertise comes from years spent in executive roles overseeing alternative programming. At ABC, he helped develop the breakout hit Wipeout and managed Dancing With the Stars. At NBCUniversal, he was in charge of series including The Voice, America's Got Talent, and American Ninja Warrior. When Riegg joined Netflix in 2016, it was as director of alternative programming. He advanced to a vice president position managing unscripted originals and acquisitions in 2018 before settling into his current position a year later."", 'Title: Vice President, Nonfiction Sports', 'Year joined Netflix: 2018', 'Reporting to Riegg, Gabe Spitzer also played a huge role in organizing the live golf tournament and tennis slam. As vice president of nonfiction sports, a position he took in April, Spitzer has directed Netflix’s sports strategy, which has largely consisted of producing docuseries following professional athletes through their seasons. Since Spitzer stepped into the role, the division premiered Tour de France: Unchained and Quarterback. It also announced new series on professional runners and the Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball team, following the likes of Formula 1: Drive to Survive and Break Point, the series on pro tennis.', '“We want to engage the sports junkie, but we also want to engage a casual viewer or a non-fan by telling the stories that are beyond [those of] a live game,” Spitzer previously told Fortune.\xa0', 'In addition to inking the recent blockbuster deal to stream WWE content, Netflix has negotiated for or expressed interest in rights for Formula 1, cycling, and women’s tennis, according to reports from Deadline and the Wall Street Journal. Netflix is also interested in the NBA rights coming up for grabs in the next year, according to the Sports Business Journal. These reports and the company’s previous practice hosting live events set it up to compete in the world of live sports.', 'Spitzer has worked in sports television throughout his career. Before Netflix, he served as senior vice president of original programming at Fox Sports, where he oversaw both original and acquired content. He also produced, directed, and showran sports-related documentaries and shorts for ESPN 30 for 30 and HBO. Before advancing to his vice president position at Netflix last year, Spitzer worked as the company’s director of documentary series starting in 2018.', 'Title: President, Ads', 'Year joined Netflix: 2016', 'Following the departure of Jeremi Gorman last year, Amy Reinhard became president of ads, in charge of building Netflix’s advertising business into a revenue-driving force. She joined the company in 2016, previously working as vice president of studio operations and vice president of content acquisitions and consumer products.', ""In just over one year, Netflix has amassed 23 million subscribers to its advertising tier. While it is still a small business relative to Netflix's total subscribership of 260 million, the company has an opportunity to earn big because of the platform’s high engagement, AllianceBernstein analyst Laurent Yoon previously told Fortune. Executives have boasted a “crawl, walk, run” approach to the business, and it is very much still in the former stages. The company is currently working to expand its ad format options for marketers."", 'Prior to working at Netflix, Reinhard spent 12 years at Paramount Pictures in business development and content distribution roles. She has degrees from Harvard Business School and Harvard’s undergraduate college.', 'Title: Vice President, Global Advertising Sales', 'Year joined Netflix: 2022', 'Netflix hired Naylor away from social media company Snap in 2022 to help launch the streamer’s ad-supported tier. In his short time at Netflix, Naylor has already seen his former Snap colleague Jeremi Gorman depart, and now reports to Reinhard.', '“Building the Netflix business over the last year has been an incredible journey and we’ve done it using the same playbook that has made Netflix the global leader in streaming,” Naylor said at\xa0an Advertising Week event in October. “You have to put together the right team and then set the right strategy… We’re not trying to offer what everyone else is offering.”', 'With Amazon having recently added an ad-supported tier to its Prime streaming service, Naylor will now face increasing competition in his role directing the Netflix advertising sales strategy. Fortunately, he has experience to lean on: Before his two years at Snap, Naylor worked as Hulu’s senior vice president of advertising sales, where he guided the company past the $1 billion ad revenue threshold for the first time in 2017. For seven years at NBCUniversal, he also sold digital advertising across the company’s portfolio of online products, including NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, and Today.', 'Title: Chief Product Officer', 'Year joined Netflix: 2021', 'Chief product officer since October, Eunice Kim is responsible for the user experience of Netflix. She manages the consumer-facing aspects of the streaming app, including pricing and plan structure, which have undergone changes in recent months and are expected to continue evolving in the coming years. Kim is continuing the company’s global crackdown on password sharing, which executives have credited with adding some of the company’s 22 million new subscribers. New app features are also under Kim’s purview, like the expanded ad formats that Netflix colleagues Reinhard and Naylor are pitching to marketers.', 'Kim recently opened up to Fortune about potential features coming to the app. She spends a lot of time thinking about how Netflix can utilize the “second screen,” or how users can simultaneously engage with the app on a television and phone, she said. Subscribers could view Emily in Paris on a television and browse the characters’ onscreen styles on a mobile device, for example. They could watch a reality competition show and vote using the Netflix phone app.', 'Netflix hired Kim away from YouTube in 2021 to lead its Consumer Product Innovation team. She had previously spent 10 years in product director roles between YouTube and Google Play. For more than a decade, she has also served on the board for Cure CMD, a nonprofit working to advance research on congenital muscular dystrophy, a muscle weakness disorder that one of her children lives with. Kim graduated with degrees from Columbia University and the business school at the University of Chicago.', 'Title: Chief Technology Officer', 'Year joined Netflix: 2020', 'Netflix promoted Elizabeth Stone to the C-suite at the same time it did Kim, with whom she works in tandem to deliver new products and features to Netflix users. As chief technology officer, Stone oversees the data science and engineering teams that build Kim’s features, conduct internal and consumer research, and analyze the performance of Netflix content. She also manages the research and development of machine learning models within Netflix. The company isn’t overly vocal about its work in artificial intelligence, but it does use machine learning to recommend titles and personalize subscribers’ feeds.', 'Stone didn’t start in the tech world, but in economics. After graduating from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she worked as an equity derivatives trader at Merrill Lynch before pursuing a Ph.D. in economics from Stanford. She then held roles as the vice president of financial consulting firm Analysis Group, chief operating officer of health care technology company Nuna, and vice president of science at Lyft. Netflix hired her away from Lyft in 2020 to work as vice president of product data science and engineering. The company promoted her to vice president of data and insights before she took the chief technology role last year.', 'Title: Vice President, Head of Live Experiences', 'Year joined Netflix: 2019', 'Lombardo was previously the CEO of Offshore Surf, a venture by American Wave Machines focused on indoor surfing pools. Now at Netflix, he’s hoping to make waves by shaking up the lucrative theme parks business dominated by entertainment industry rivals Disney and Warner Bros.', '“We believe live experiences are an incredible way to fuel and sustain fandom,” Lombardo said at an Advertising Week event in New York in October. “People want to experience [our stories] in more deep and immersive ways, especially in those periods of time between new season launches.”', 'Instead of roller coasters and Ferris wheels, Lombardo’s strategy to lure crowds revolves around Netflix House, a chain of brick-and-mortar locations that will offer dining, merchandise, and live experiences based on the streaming giant’s content. The houses, set to open in 2025, will leverage Netflix’s hit franchises like Stranger Things and Squid Game, rotating exhibits based on whatever is popular at the time. And unlike with theme parks, Netflix expects fans to visit locations multiple times each year, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company’s October earnings call.', 'Title: Vice President, Consumer Products', 'Year joined Netflix: 2020', 'Josh Simon leads Netflix’s efforts to extend its onscreen hits to the real world, from retail shelves to live events. A Harvard graduate who has worked stints at Disney and Function Drinks, Simon was most recently vice president of product and merchandising strategy at Nike before joining Netflix in 2020.', 'In 2022, Simon’s team leaned into Netflix’s popular Bridgerton series by creating a custom makeup line with Pat McGrath Labs and a pop-up shop with Bloomingdale’s, which sold themed dresses, crystal glasses, tea, and perfume. The company also produced The Queen’s Ball: A Bridgerton Experience, an event that rotated through major North American cities where fans dressed in Regency-era gowns, listened to live music, and watched a dance performance. In the strategy and launch, Simon’s team worked with Shondaland, the Shonda Rhimes–led production company that is behind the series.', '“We’re not just looking to create more stuff,” Simon said in an internal interview in 2022. “We ask ourselves whether a given product line or experience allows a viewer to explore the world more deeply, express their fandom, or extends the story in compelling ways.""', 'Title: Vice President, Games', 'Year joined Netflix: 2021', 'With 30 years of experience in the gaming industry, Mike Verdu is in charge of building Netflix’s video games business into something that can have a material impact on the company. Verdu joined as vice president of games in 2021 from Facebook, where he oversaw the developers making virtual reality apps for the Oculus VR headset. Previously, he worked in executive positions at video game companies Electronic Arts, Zynga, and Kabam. With a degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, he also founded three companies—software developer Paragon Systems, PC game publisher Legend Entertainment, and mobile game studio TapZen—all of which were acquired.', 'Growth is on the agenda for the games segment. “Our current scale—and frankly, our current investment—are both very, very, very small relative to our overall content spend and engagement,” co-CEO Greg Peters said during Netflix’s October earnings call. “We want to really grow our engagement by many multiples of where it is today over the next handful of years.”', 'Netflix hasn’t disclosed how many users engage with its games, but in October, a third-party data firm pegged it at 2.2 million people, or 0.9% of the platform’s user base at that time. By the end of 2023, user engagement with games tripled from the year prior, executives said in the company’s January earnings call.', 'At the end of the year, Netflix offered 86 games in its catalog, with nearly 90 more in development. It makes games from its own intellectual property, including Stranger Things, The Witcher, and The Queen’s Gambit. It also offers popular titles like Grand Theft Auto, Oxenfree, and Heads Up.', 'The games don’t currently contain ads or in-app purchases. Like Netflix’s live events business, games are meant to keep fans engaged in between seasons, which can help drive hype for new launches, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in the October earnings call.', 'Title: Chief Content Officer', 'Year joined Netflix: 2016', 'For other executives to excel, Bela Bajaria must first do her job well. As chief content officer since January 2023, Bajaria is in charge of all the films and television shows that hit Netflix’s platform around the world. Netflix titles have routinely dominated Nielsen’s most watched lists, with Young Sheldon, Fool Me Once, and American Nightmare as recent hits. The company must continue to produce buzzy, fandom-driving content to merit its strategy to build out story universes through games, live experiences, and products. In the coming months, Netflix is releasing season 3 of Bridgerton, a second Rebel Moon film, and Lindsay Lohan’s Irish Wish. Bajaria also spearheaded Netflix’s recently announced deal to stream live professional wrestling for the next decade.', 'Before Bajaria’s promotion earlier this year, she worked as head of global television and vice president of content at Netflix. She was responsible for greenlighting Squid Game, the Korean drama that broke company viewership records, won six Emmy awards, and inspired a reality spinoff. Before her time at Netflix, Bajaria served as president of the Hollywood Radio and Television Society, a professional industry association of which she is still a board member. She has also worked at CBS, Warner Bros. Television Studios, and Universal Television.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Just take a look at Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), which is up 65%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 19% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 41% in the last year , including dividends ."", ""So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress."", ' See our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', ""While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Phillips 66's TSR for the last 3 years was 87%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""It's nice to see that Phillips 66 shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 41% over the last year.

Reconciliations detailing the impact of the extra week on our results and other adjustments can be found in today's press release and on the Investors section of our website. Adjusted net sales grew to $15.5 billion, a 7% increase versus last year.

Back to the results. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated comp sales increased in both our apparel and home businesses. In terms of divisional sales performance for the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see strong comp sales increases at every division, all driven entirely by customer transactions. At Marmaxx, I also note that we saw comp increases in both our apparel and home categories. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax profit margin of 10.9% was up 170 basis points versus last year. Our adjusted pretax profit margin came in well above our plan primarily due to a higher merchandise margin. This includes a larger-than-expected benefit from shrink and freight, lower markdowns and better mark on."", ""We also saw some expense leverage on our above-plan sales. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 340 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a higher merchandise margin, including a significant benefit from lower freight costs and shrink strong mark-on and lower markdowns. Fourth quarter adjusted SG&A increased 190 basis points versus last year, primarily due to higher incentive accruals and incremental store wage and payroll costs. Adjusted net interest income benefited fourth quarter adjusted pretax profit margin by 10 basis points versus last year.

We remain focused on shrink and continue to look for ways to improve this area going forward. Full year adjusted SG&A was 19.3%, up 140 basis points versus last year's 17.9%.

I'll pick it up with some full year divisional highlights. As we saw with our strong fourth quarter sales, every division delivered comp increases for the full year, with customer transactions driving the increases across the businesses.

Overall sales well exceeded $30 billion. Comp store sales increased a very strong 6%. We also surpassed 2,500 total T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores. Marmaxx's apparel and home categories, both comp up for the year. Further, we saw consistently strong comp sales increases across regions and income demographics."", ""As to Marmaxx's profitability, we were extremely pleased to see full year adjusted segment profit margin improved significantly to 13.7%. As we look ahead, we are very excited about the opportunities to see -- that we see to grow our customer base, drive sales, open new stores and increase the profitability of our largest division. At Sierra, which is reported with Marmaxx, we were pleased with the continued sales growth. At our online businesses, we added new categories and brands throughout the year to deliver the same freshness and excitement online as we do in our stores. At HomeGoods, annual sales grew to nearly $9 billion and comps grew 3%. It was great to see the home business return to positive comp sales trends. We are particularly pleased with the acceleration we saw in the second half of the year, with comp sales increasing high single digits."", 'Similar to Marmaxx, we saw consistent performance across regions and income demographics. HomeGoods adjusted profitability also improved significantly to 9.4% and getting closer to our goal of returning this division to a double-digit profit margin. During the year, we opened a combined 34 HomeGoods and HomeSense stores. Long term, we see exciting potential to bring our eclectic mix of home fashions to even more consumers across the United States. Moving to TJX Canada. Full year sales were $5 billion and comp store sales increased 3%. Adjusted segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 14%.

This would be flat to up 10 basis points versus fiscal '24 adjusted pretax profit margin of 10.9%. Moving to full year gross margin. We expect it to be in the range of 30% to 30.1%, a 10 to 20 basis point increase versus fiscal '24 as adjusted gross margin of 29.9%.

For full year SG&A, we're expecting it to be approximately 19.3% and flat to last year's adjusted SG&A. We're planning incremental store wage and payroll costs to be offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a benefit from items that negatively impacted us last year. We're planning full year net interest income of about $118 million, which would delever fiscal '25 pretax profit by about 10 basis points. For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a full year tax rate of 26.0% and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.14 billion shares.

We're planning first quarter pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.5% to 10.6%, an increase of 20 to 30 basis points versus last year. Next, we expect first quarter gross margin to be approximately 29.8%. This would be an increase of 90 basis points versus last year's -- last year primarily due to a higher merchandise margin which includes the annualization of lower freight costs from last year and favorable mark-on, partially offset by supply chain investments."", ""We're expecting first quarter SG&A to be approximately 19.5%, up 50 basis points versus last year. We expect this increase to be primarily driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with NEM.', ""On February 29, 2024, Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM), the world's largest gold miner, filed its annual 10-K report with the SEC, providing a wealth of information for a comprehensive SWOT analysis. The company, known for its strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of Goldcorp in 2019 and Newcrest in November 2023, has a robust portfolio with 17 wholly or majority-owned mines and interests in two joint ventures across the Americas, Africa, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. In 2024, Newmont is expected to produce approximately 6.9 million ounces of gold, with plans to divest higher-cost, smaller mines that account for 20% of forecasted sales. Besides gold, Newmont produces significant amounts of copper, silver, zinc, and lead as byproducts. With two decades of gold reserves and substantial byproduct reserves as of December 2023, Newmont's financial health is underpinned by its extensive resource base and strategic market positioning."", ""Global Leadership and Production Scale: Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) stands as a global leader in gold production, a position solidified by strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. The company's scale affords it significant operational efficiencies and bargaining power with suppliers. With a projected gold production of 6.9 million ounces in 2024, Newmont benefits from economies of scale that can lower production costs and improve profitability. The acquisition of Newcrest further enhances its production capabilities, ensuring a steady stream of output to meet global demand."", ""Robust Reserve Base: Newmont's extensive reserve base, with two decades of gold reserves, provides a long-term outlook for production stability. This vast resource base is a critical strength, as it ensures the company's ability to sustain production levels and generate revenue over an extended period. The reserves also offer a buffer against the volatility of exploration success and the risks associated with developing new mines."", ""Dependence on Commodity Prices: Newmont's financial performance is inherently tied to the fluctuating prices of gold and other metals like copper, silver, zinc, and lead. The 10-K filing reveals that any substantial or extended decline in these commodity prices could materially affect the company's revenues and profitability, especially since Newmont does not engage in hedging transactions for its metal sales. This price sensitivity is a significant weakness, as it exposes the company to market forces beyond its control."", ""Operational and Geopolitical Risks: The company's operations are spread across various geopolitical landscapes, which introduces risks related to political instability, regulatory changes, and social unrest. These factors can impact Newmont's ability to operate efficiently and may lead to disruptions or increased costs. Additionally, the capital-intensive nature of the mining industry necessitates ongoing investment in equipment and facilities, which can strain financial resources if not managed effectively."", ""Strategic Divestitures and Asset Optimization: Newmont's plan to sell higher-cost, smaller mines presents an opportunity to optimize its asset portfolio and focus on its most profitable operations. This strategic move can improve overall margins and free up capital for investment in projects with higher returns. The divestitures also allow Newmont to streamline operations and potentially reduce operational complexity and risk."", ""ESG Leadership and Innovation: Newmont's commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership, as evidenced by its consistent ranking on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, opens doors to new investments and partnerships. The company's focus on sustainable and responsible mining practices can attract ESG-focused investors and enhance its corporate reputation, providing a competitive advantage in the industry."", ""Environmental and Regulatory Challenges: Mining operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, which can lead to increased compliance costs and operational constraints. Newmont's 10-K filing acknowledges the extensive environmental risks and the potential for remediation costs to exceed provisions. Climate change also poses transitional and physical risks that could impact operations and necessitate significant investment to adapt to new regulatory and societal expectations."", 'Market and Economic Volatility: The cyclical nature of the commodities market means that Newmont faces ongoing threats from economic downturns and reduced demand for metals. Additionally, competition from other natural resource companies and the emergence of alternative investment vehicles, such as cryptocurrencies, can impact investor sentiment and the attractiveness of gold and other metals as investment options.', 'In conclusion, Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) exhibits a strong market position with its large-scale production and reserve base, yet it faces challenges from commodity price dependence and geopolitical risks. Opportunities for growth and efficiency gains exist through strategic divestitures and a focus on ESG initiatives. However, environmental regulations and market volatility remain significant threats that require careful management. As Newmont navigates these dynamics, its strategic decisions will be crucial in maintaining its leadership position and ensuring long-term success in the competitive mining industry.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

And thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm Larry Coben, and I am the Chairman, Interim President and CEO. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer and we also have members of the management team on the call and available for question. While I have been CEO for three months, I have been Chairman for seven and on the Board for 20 years. I have never been more excited about NRG as a company than I am today. Let's begin with the NRG value proposition on Slide four. We are the trusted partner to almost eight million residential customers earned every day through unique and differentiated offerings that simplify and improve our customers lives. We have 5.9 million energy and 2 million smart home customers and manage the second largest C&I Energy and Natural Gas retail portfolio in the country."", ""We have taken the necessary steps to position NRG to win the energy transition. At the convergence of energy and technology in the home and grid, with the evolution of smart devices and generative AI data centers. We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in financial flexibility to return significant capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our business and financial outlook has never been stronger. And I've never been more excited about the future of the company than I am today. Turning to Slide five. First, in 2023 we delivered record free cash flow before growth and near record adjusted EBITDA. We exceeded our Investor Day outlook and our previously increased 2023 guidance ranges."", ""This is the direct result of the strategic initiatives and actions we've taken in recent years to strengthen and stabilize our business. Our outlook continues to get better and better, and today we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges. Next, we made significant progress advancing our long term energy transition and electrification strategy. We have line of sight to achieving our current $550 million by 2025. And we are now turning our attention to the next phase of our growth. Lastly, we continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which involves both a strong balance sheet and returning significant capital to you, our shareholders. Turning to Slide six. We delivered $844 million of adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, 82% higher than the prior year."", 'This brings our full year results to $3.282 billion of adjusted EBITDA, 76% higher than last year, primarily driven by improved operational performance of our Integrated Energy platform and the addition of our Smart Home Business. Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $152 million above our original guidance midpoint, and at the high end of our adjusted guidance, while free cash flow before growth came in above the high end of our increased guidance range at $1.92 billion, or $185 million above our original guidance midpoint. This resulted in $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share in 2023, well ahead of the $8.50 per target provided at our June Investor Day. Bruce will provide more details certainly, but again, this performance is the direct result of our strategic initiatives and actions taken to strengthen and grow our business.', ""And I know that these took place even with share purchases occurring at higher levels than projected about Investor Day. Turning to our 2023 scorecard, we delivered across our strategic priorities. As you know, safety is our top priority, and I'm pleased to share that we achieve top decile safety performance through a year with many distractions. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their focus, and dedication and hard work to making this happen, as well as the making our financial results happen. Next, we made progress in our continuous improvement goals for cost excellence. We completed the $300 million Direct Energy Synergy program announced earlier in the year, and we quickly turned our attention to identify and execute our previously announced next phase of cost initiatives $250 million by the end of 2025."", ""Turning to growth, our success in achieving the $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share versus our $8.50 target was primarily driven by faster execution of our growth plan. We are incredibly pleased with the results of our Smart Home acquisition and believe our current growth plan is just the beginning. We are only starting to scratch the surface. Lastly, on capital allocation, we executed over $1.5 billion in debt paid down and returned another $1.5 billion to shareholders. Turning to Slide seven, let's take a look at our 2024, outlook. Today, we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges, and our Investor Day 15% to 20% growth strategic roadmap. We are well positioned across each of our businesses to deliver on our commitments."", 'In consumer energy we expect the momentum gained in 2023, to continue into 2024, with volume margins and earnings growing across residential and small commercial as well as commercial and industrial customer segments. They success will be driven by our diverse and efficient marketing and sales engines, our leading care and retention capabilities, and our best-in-class innovative digital experience. We are also seizing numerous opportunities as they arise or as we create them. An exciting example is Lubbock, Texas, a market of just over 100,000 customers that opened in early January, with 65% of customers having already made their electricity provider choice. So far we are exceeding expectations for our success and winning customers and look forward to bring our innovative offerings and experiences to that market.', ""We also continue to see momentum with Community Choice programs, as a way for customers to experience the benefits of electricity competition in markets that don't have favorable political and regulatory sentiment that would allow customers to have the ability to freely choose their electricity providers. Next, our diversified supply strategy manages our retail exposure in multiple scenarios to include events, like the extreme summer of 2023 and Winter Storm Heather this past January, well, at the same time handling the mild weather that we have seen most of this winter. Our targeted investments for reliability and flexibility across our fleet led to material improvements in the performance of our generation when we needed it, and we expect to realize continued improvements."", 'We continue to evaluate various ways to enhance our supply strategy. We have three brownfield sites ready to go in Texas with dispatch flexibility, and we are considering additional storage options for the portfolio, primarily through longer term structured transactions, rather than outright ownership. And finally, the smart home business delivered a strong year driving impressive top and bottom line growth, recurring revenue and margin per customer increased through selling more products and services while simultaneously reducing net service costs per customer, we will continue to drive toward the horizontal expansion of our eight million customers wallet. Our customer retention is the best in the industry with an average customer life in the Smart Home Business of nine years, driven by unmatched customer engagement and world class, product performance and reliability.', 'We continue to focus on integrating Smart Home and Energy in achieving the initiatives we have previously communicated to you. Turning to Slide 8, for a closer look at growth and cost initiatives. In 2023, we advanced our energy transition electrification, and continuous improvement strategy and delivered $138 million of incremental earnings, which was more times than twice our original $65 million target. We exceeded our goals for both growth and cost savings resulting in more than $100 million of growth in our core businesses and sales channel optimization and more than $35 million in cost savings. This outperformance was primarily the result of realizing synergies faster than originally anticipated. And today, we are reaffirming the full plan target of $550 million of growth and cost initiatives by the end of 2025.', 'Outside of this $550 million program, we have also identified additional attractive initiatives that are in early development, leveraging the significant value creation opportunity from the convergence of energy and technology in the home in the grid. First, is for example, Virtual Power Plants are VPP, where we are uniquely positioned given our customers scale and reach, our data science, proficiency and decades of commercial market -- commercial and market experience. Importantly, VPP will increase in value as the grid tightens, and our Integrated Energy Business will allow us to monetize this value without requiring regulatory change. Second on data centers and AI. Today, we are one of the largest competitive providers of power to the hyperscalers and other data center managers.', ""And we have been in direct conversations with several of these customers about using more load. We see this as a significant opportunity for NRG and for competitive markets more broadly. Finally, we continue to evaluate strategic dispatchable new build, with 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield projects in Texas ready to go. As you may know in November, Texas voters approved the Texas Energy Fund, which provides support for new dispatchable generation. We expect the rules for that to be adopted earlier this year with applications beginning mid-year. We anticipate providing an update on these projects over the coming months. With that I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Chung, for a financial review."", 'Bruce Chung: Thank you, Larry. Moving to Slide 10. For 2023, NRG produced adjusted EBITDA of $3.282 billion, exceeding our original guidance and at the high end of our upward revised guidance range. And free cash flow before growth of $1.925 billion, exceeding the high end of our upward revised guidance range. Our 2023 free cash flow before growth and adjusted EBITDA represent the highest and second highest respectively in NRG’s history. This strong financial performance is a direct result of excellent execution across our businesses, and made possible by the continued focus and effort from each of our employees in a year full of potential distractions. Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA improved by $1.4 billion as compared to 2022, driven by strong performance in our Texas region, the addition of the Vivint Smart Home Business and execution of our growth and cost efficiency plans.', ""Taking a closer look at the drivers within our segments, and beginning with Texas. Our full year adjusted EBITDA increased by $806 million over 2022. This was driven by higher revenue rates coupled with lower supply costs. Our diversified supply strategy worked as designed throughout a volatile year, lowering our supply costs during the mild start to the year and providing stable pricing through the summer's extreme heat. As we discussed throughout 2023, the margin expansion we saw across both our residential and C&I energy businesses, was produced through a combination of careful revenue rate management, and providing our customers with differentiated products that address their needs for affordability, comfort and peace of mind. We believe this margin expansion will be durable over the foreseeable future, and this view is reflected in our 2024 guidance."", 'In addition to improved margins, our Residential Energy business delivered strong customer retention of nearly 80%, while maintaining average customer tenure of six years. This is a testament to the strength of our brands, and customer experience. Our East/West services segments were lower by $142 million versus the prior year. This was due to $60 million from asset retirements in sales, with the remainder of the variance from the combination of lower average realized pricing at the Cottonwood facility, as well as a challenging housing market and more conservative consumer discretionary spending impacting our HVAC and Goal Zero services businesses. Finally, the addition of Smart Home contributed $753 million in adjusted EBITDA, finishing above the high end of our upward revised guidance for this segment.', 'Throughout 2023, Smart Home delivered across all of its key metrics. Most notably, Smart Home achieved 6%, ending subscriber growth in an otherwise challenging macro environment. In addition to improving monthly recurring service margins at 9%, through increasing average monthly revenue per subscriber coupled with a continued focus on cost efficiency. Turning to free cash flow before growth. NRG achieved $1.925 billion in 2023, setting a new record for the company. This represents an improvement of $1.4 billion over the prior year, primarily driven by our stronger EBITDA performance, along with improved working capital initiatives across our businesses. At our Investor Day in June, we communicated the 2023 target of $8.50 of free cash flow before growth per share.', 'Our strong performance in 2023 resulted in $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share, even after repurchasing shares, at a 25% premium to what we had originally assumed in our Investor Day plan. Our platform is designed to generate significant cash flow, and based on that $9.25 per share, and our current share price that represents an implied free cash flow yield of 18%. Given this dislocation repurchasing our shares remains one of the best investments we can make. And as such, we remain firmly committed to staying the course with our capital allocation framework. Throughout 2023, we have demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our strategy, and coupled with the compelling long term macro tailwinds for the increasing electrification of the economy, and convergence of energy with smart technologies, we are confident in the outlook for our share price.', ""Turning to the next slide, I'd like to provide some additional context for 2023 financial results. On the left side of the page, we highlight the resiliency of our core energy business. Our Texas fleet performed well through the second hottest summer in Texas history, and most recently continued to perform through the volatility experienced during January's Winter Storm Heather. Over the last few years, we have strategically invested capital in improving the reliability of our facilities and anticipation of volatility across both summer and winter conditions. And we are seeing the impact of those investments through material improvement in our -- in the money availability factor. This is a performance measure illustrating the availability of our generation assets during periods when we need them the most."", ""As you can see in the bar chart, we realized a 14% and 13% improvement in summer and winter respectively in this metric. Furthermore, we saw a nearly 20% improvement in this metric on comparing the fleet performance during a Winter Storm Heather versus Winter Storm Elliott. This level of improvement was and will be critical to ensuring we're able to serve our retail load cost effectively. Moving to the right side of the page, our Smart Home Business surpassing original expectations, primarily driven by expanded monthly recurring service margins. Notably, the margin expansion was a function of both higher average revenues per subscriber coupled with lower cost to serve. We're also seeing higher take rates on Smart Home products and services at the point of sale, which is a testament to the effectiveness of our Smart Home sales channels, and Smart Home customers recognizing the benefit of increasing the intelligence of their homes through additional seamlessly integrated devices."", 'Turning to Slide 12, for an updated view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see from the slide, not much has changed since our third quarter earnings call, where we provided our initial view on 2024 capital allocation. We are still planning on $500 million of debt paid down in 2024, and expect to return nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common dividends. Coupled with the 2023 share repurchase program, we will have executed nearly 75% of the current $2.7 billion authorization by the end of 2024. We expect the 2023 accelerated share repurchase program to conclude by the end of Q1 this year, at which point we will begin executing our 2024 repurchase plan on a more regular and programmatic basis throughout the year.', ""As I mentioned earlier, at an implied yield of 18%, we see our shares as an excellent investment for shareholder capital. And as such, remain committed to the 80-20 principle we rolled out during an Investor Day. In terms of incremental changes since our last earnings call and moving from left to right, 2024 excess cash increased $74 million because of the over performance in 2023. Other investments increased $33 million, primarily from a calendar year shift in integration costs and capital deployed to small book acquisitions in our Residential Retail business. Finally, we have $41 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024, which we will evaluate the use of as we move along the year. Before I hand it back to Larry, I'd like to point out that we included some new slides in the appendix of today's presentation, which provide more disclosure around our energy business."", 'We believe this disclosure will enable investors to model our energy business with a level of granularity they did not have before. These slides will be updated with each earnings call we have going forward. We hope you find them helpful, and our Investor Relations team is more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the new disclosures. With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry.', 'Larry Coben: Thank you, Bruce. On Slide 14, I want to provide a few closing thoughts about 2024, our priorities and our expectations. We are laser focused on delivering on our financial and operational commitments and adhering to our capital allocation principles. We will continue to integrate Smart Home with our energy businesses and deliver on our growth and cost initiatives. All while advancing our energy transition and electrification strategy. I have never been more excited about the future of energy. We are seeing signs of step change improvement in fundamentals across our platform, including the convergence of energy and technology in the home and grid through smart devices and generative AI. We believe this will put a spotlight on the scarcity of the critical products and services we sell and the durability of our platform.', ""Said bluntly, I believe this step change will signify a change in the depressed valuations for NRG in our sector that have resulted in 20% plus cash flow yields. This will be good for NRG and the sector and its very exciting times. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. With that thank you for your time and your interest in NRG.

An ABR of 1.65 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 70.6% and 5.9% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NEE', 'Check price target & stock forecast for NextEra here>>>While the ABR calls for buying NextEra, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is NEE Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for NextEra, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.44.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NextEra.

(NASDAQ:PDCO) released its third-quarter result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 5.9% to US$27.09 in the past week. Patterson Companies reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$1.6b and statutory earnings per share of US$0.52, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Patterson Companies ', ""After the latest results, the eleven analysts covering Patterson Companies are now predicting revenues of US$6.77b in 2025. If met, this would reflect a satisfactory 3.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory per share are forecast to be US$2.19, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$6.80b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.24 in 2025. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a minor downgrade to their earnings per share forecasts."", ""It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at US$30.00, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Patterson Companies, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$34.00 and the most bearish at US$28.00 per share. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth."", ""Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. We would highlight that Patterson Companies' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 2.5% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 4.4% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.8% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Patterson Companies."", 'The biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Patterson Companies. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$30.00, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.', ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Patterson Companies. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Patterson Companies analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""You still need to take note of risks, for example - Patterson Companies has   3 warning signs  (and 2 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about."", 'Have feedback on this article?

I will begin my remarks today with the highlights of our consolidated results and then a review of our core strategic objectives and the progress we are making toward those goals before providing details on the financial performance of each of our segments. I’ll start with some key highlights. Our team executed well and successfully navigated a dynamic environment to deliver year-over-year sales growth and gross margin expansion. On the topline, year-over-year internal sales increased 0.3%, driven by continued above-market sales growth in our Dental Consumables and Production Animal businesses, demonstrating the deep, differentiated value proposition we provide customers across our end markets.', 'Our initiatives to drive margin improvement continue to prove successful as we’ve expanded gross margin for Patterson as a whole by 30 basis points when compared to the same period a year ago. This result reflects our continued focus on efficiency, including working strategically with manufacturers, driving improved mix, exercising expense discipline and leveraging our cost structure. On the bottomline, our financial results reflect ongoing cost discipline measures balanced against the continued strategic investments Patterson is making across our businesses to further enhance our long-term performance and profitability. We also returned nearly $150 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.', 'Ultimately, Patterson generated an adjusted EPS of $0.59 for the third quarter. Looking forward, we are revising our fiscal 2024 earnings guidance to reflect our expectations for the fourth quarter, including continued headwinds in the Dental Equipment market, which I will provide more detail on shortly. For fiscal year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings in the range of $2.30 per diluted share to $2.35 per diluted share. As we move forward, we remain confident in the resilience of our end markets, the strength of our business and Patterson’s competitive positioning and value creation potential. Our confidence is underscored by our decision to repurchase approximately $125 million of shares during the third quarter and steadfast commitment to our long-term strategy.', 'Our team remains dedicated to executing against our long-term strategy, which, as a reminder, is designed to achieve four core objectives. First, drive revenue growth above the current end market growth rates. Second, build upon the progress we’ve made to enhance our margin performance. Third, evolve our products, channels and services to best serve the customers in our end markets. And fourth, improve efficiency and optimization. Leveraging our strong balance sheet, we continue to invest across the business to drive progress on these strategic objectives during the third quarter. This included investments in our distribution capabilities and software offerings to further differentiate Patterson as a partner of choice for our customers. I’d like to highlight just a few specific examples that we’ve been working on to demonstrate our progress.', 'First, the recently expanded dental distribution facility in Montreal, Canada is open and operational. This state-of-the-art facility, equipped with a modern software system and advanced fulfillment infrastructure, will enhance our ability to serve our Canadian customers effectively and efficiently. This modernization effort enables Patterson to further optimize our sales effort, gain deeper insight into our customer needs and identify potential gaps in our offerings in this market, ultimately allowing us to bring Patterson’s full value proposition to bear for our customers in Canada. We’re excited about the opportunity our investment in Montreal can bring, as we’ve seen the benefits of similar investments in other geographies. Our fully automated, next-generation Animal Health fulfillment center in the U.K., which we call the Big Shed, has already fueled accelerated revenue growth and strengthened our market position in the region.', 'During the third quarter, Patterson also continued to invest behind our robust suite of software solutions in both our Dental and Animal Health segments. As we’ve discussed previously, we believe the opportunity for growth within software is meaningful and we’re investing to enhance our existing products, drive productivity gains and cater to evolving customer preferences. For example, during the third quarter, our Dental business announced a relationship with Pearl, a leading AI solution provider for the Dental business. This will enable us to integrate Pearl’s AI pathology detection feature set, called Second Opinion, into Patterson’s Eaglesoft practice management software. Second Opinion uses AI to help dentists detect conditions commonly diagnosed in X-rays.', 'It’s a great example of the way we’re investing in our existing solutions to create enhanced value for our customers. We’re also partnering with Pearl to build integrations with our Fuse cloud-based practice management software and Dolphin practice management software. Those integrations will be announced at a future date. On the Animal Health side, we’ve continued to invest in Turnkey, a market-leading enterprise resource planning system for cattle producers. The majority of U.S. cattle on automated feed systems are managed by the Turnkey platform. Our recent investments have focused on empowering cattle producers to make more data-driven decisions as they leverage Turnkey to run more efficient, profitable businesses. We have confidence in the investments we are making for the long-term growth and success of Patterson, especially as we continue to build a track record of driving returns from our strategic investments.', 'Last year, Patterson completed acquisitions of Dairy Tech and RSVP and ACT. Today, Dairy Tech, which provides pasteurizing equipment for producers, is operating as a Patterson-owned brand and is continuing to perform ahead of our internal projections with strong margin contributions. Meanwhile, our team is continuing to expand RSVP and ACT’s geographic reach to serve more veterinary and staffing and video-based training services and needs across additional states, as well as data extraction and conversion services. As we’ve said before, we remain committed to managing the organization with a keen focus on cost disciplines. We continue to focus on running a rigorous process for this discipline and return on our investments that leverages best practices and advanced operational excellence across the enterprise.', 'As we enter the final quarter of fiscal 2024 and look forward to fiscal 2025, we continue to believe that the strength of our team, the resiliency of the Dental and Animal Health end markets, and our comprehensive value proposition make Patterson well-positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation over the long-term. Now I’ll provide more detail on the financial performance in each of our two business segments during the fiscal third quarter. Let’s start with Dental. In the third quarter, Dental segment internal sales increased 2.5% year-over-year, driven by robust performance in consumables. We believe both our consumables and equipment business performed better in the overall market during the third quarter. The Patterson team’s steadfast focus and execution has enabled us to consistently deliver above-market growth in consumables over the past year.', 'In fact, if you take a look at the four fiscal quarters prior to Q3, we delivered an average quarterly year-over-year consumables growth of just over 5%, excluding certain infection control products. We built upon this track record in the third quarter, achieving over 6% growth in the category, and when excluding certain infection control products, just over 7% growth. We attributed our continued success in consumable growth to Patterson’s differentiated value proposition for Dental customers. It is rooted in strong execution on the deep relationships we have built with our Dental customers over time, thanks to a mature and knowledgeable sales force that acts as a true partner to Dental customers of all sizes, from independent practices to DSOs and everything in between.', 'Our team is consistently seeking to be an indispensable partner that supports dentists with everything they need to run their practices, allowing them to focus on what’s important, patient care. Our consumables performance during the quarter was also supported by consistent patient traffic, reflecting the Dental end market’s resiliency and ability to drive demand despite inflationary pressures. Patients continue to prioritize essential dental care, even when they might be cutting back on some of the other discretionary spending. In the Dental Equipment business, internal sales declined on a year-over-year basis about 2%, as improved performance in high-tech equipment was more than offset by declining core equipment sales, as we lapped post-COVID supply chain delays.', 'Our results demonstrate two key points. First, the variability of the Dental Equipment category and how equipment sales, whether high-tech or core, can fluctuate year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. During the third quarter, this bore out with lower-than-anticipated sales performance in our core equipment category. Second, in our fiscal 2024 third quarter, equipment demand was challenged by continued macroeconomic pressures, including comparatively higher interest rates and less capital availability than the year-ago period. We expect these dynamics to continue to shape our equipment performance in the fourth quarter and have revised our 2024 full year adjusted UPS guidance accordingly. We have navigated economic cycles successfully in the past.', 'We remain confident in our ability to overcome these headwinds by continuing to work strategically with our manufacturing partners and by delivering comprehensive support that enables our customers to streamline operations, optimize resources, and ultimately, focus on patient care. What’s most important are the longer term trends. The growing use of digital technologies enables dentists to offer an improved patient experience with a higher level of oral healthcare. That improved experience for both dentists and patients drives demand for innovation and supports a long runway of growth over time. When new technology enters the marketplace, Patterson is best positioned to sell, finance, install and service that technology for the complete lifecycle of those investments.', 'Finally, Dental internal sales in our value-added services category were roughly flat compared to the prior year period. Value-added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers to enhance the customer experience, drive loyalty and help make Patterson an indispensable partner to their practice. The Dental value-added services category includes software and e-services, the foundation of a modern dental practice, and remains a long-term growth opportunity for Patterson. We are confident that continuing to invest in and promote our cloud-based software helps maximize our value-added services offerings and will deepen our comprehensive value proposition to our customers. Looking ahead, we believe the Dental market remains stable with healthy underlying fundamentals, including an aging population, practice modernization and a direct link between the patient’s oral health and overall health.', 'We remain confident in our team’s ability to effectively navigate a dynamic environment and achieve our long-term goals. Now let’s move on to our Animal Health segment. During the third quarter, Patterson’s Animal Health segment internal sales decreased 1.5% year-over-year, as above market growth in the Production Animal business was more than offset by reduced sales in the companion animal business. Our Animal Health team achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin improvement of 22 basis points, further building upon their track record of year-over-year operating margin expansion in six of the last eight fiscal quarters. This excellent progression is testament to the Animal Health team’s disciplined execution of the margin accretive initiatives that we have put in place.', 'In companion animal, our internal sales in the third quarter declined by low-single digits. This performance reflects our own strategic decisions and continued discipline to focus on more profitable business in the quarter in ways that modestly reduced our topline growth while supporting our margin enhancement initiatives. This includes working closely with vendors who reward us for our extensive value proposition. We remain committed to driving continued margin expansion while sustaining healthy topline performance within a stable end market. Over the long-term, we expect the companion animal market to grow in the low-single digits, building upon the substantial growth this market has experienced since the onset of the pandemic. The health of this end market is supported by strong fundamentals and positive long-term trends in pet parenting.', 'On the Production Animal side, thanks to our team’s outstanding execution, third quarter internal sales grew by low-single digits in a dynamic market environment. We believe Patterson continues to outperform the broader Production Animal market due to the strength of our omnichannel presence, highly tailored distribution strategy and comprehensive offering across species. Across the Animal Health segment, our value-added services category delivered robust double-digit growth during the quarter, reflecting continued demand for a suite of software solutions and e-services that resonate strongly with customers. Similar to our Dental segment, our value-added services offering is a differentiator for Patterson and enables us to support the full lifecycle of equipment for our customers.', 'We’re confident that the opportunity for continued growth within software remains significant. We continue to invest in existing solutions to better leverage our strong foundation, add to our capabilities and address evolving customer preferences. As we look ahead, we believe our Animal Health business is positioned for continued success. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Kevin Barry to provide more details on our financials.', 'Kevin Barry: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on January 27, 2024, and then conclude with our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. Let’s begin by covering the financial results. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal 2024 third quarter were $1.62 billion, an increase of 1.0% over the third quarter of one year ago. Internal sales increased 0.3% compared to the same period last year. Gross margin for the third fiscal quarter 2024 was 21.7%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year period. Beginning with our fiscal 2024 second quarter, we began providing the financial metric adjusted gross margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts gross margin for the impact of the mark-to-market accounting related to our equipment financing portfolio and the associated interest rate swap hedging instrument.', 'The accounting impact of the mark-to-market adjustment impacts our total company gross margin, but not the gross margin within our business segment. And as previously mentioned, the net impact of interest rate fluctuations between the swap and the equipment financing portfolio has minimal impact on net income. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our adjusted gross margin was 21.6%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 16.8% and unfavorable by 70 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. A portion of the unfavorable comparison is attributable to expenses associated with the strategic investments we made to enhance our distribution capabilities and software offerings in the quarter.', 'In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.7%, a decrease of 50 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margin includes the adjustment for the interest rate swap mentioned previously. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we intend to continue exercising expense discipline, while also prioritizing the margin enhancement initiatives that have been yielding results within our business segments and for the company overall. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 23.3%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the prior year period. Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $47.7 million or $0.52 per diluted share.', 'This compares to reported net income in the third quarter of last year of $53.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $55.0 million or $0.59 per diluted share. This compares to $61.1 million or $0.62 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This decrease in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal third quarter was primarily due to lower sales of Dental Equipment and increased operating expenses compared to the prior year period. Now let’s turn to our business segments, starting with our Dental business. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, internal sales for our Dental business increased 2.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023.', 'Internal sales of Dental Consumables increased 6.3% compared to one year ago, despite being impacted by continued price deflation of certain infection-controlled products. Internal sales of non-infection-controlled products increased 7.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the year ago period. This negative impact from infection-controlled product deflation has steadily moderated over the past year and we expect the year-over-year deflationary impacts to normalize by the end of fiscal year 2024. Internal sales of Dental Equipment during the quarter decreased 2.4% compared to one year ago. Our equipment category continues to be impacted by headwinds related to macroeconomic concerns, a higher interest rate environment and selling price declines.', 'However, during the third quarter, digital X-ray and CAD/CAM equipment categories posted positive sales growth, reflecting the desire for many dentists to continue investing in technology to modernize their practices. Internal sales of value-added services in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 0.2% over the prior year period. Value-added services, including our software offerings, represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make us an indispensable partner to their practice. We remain confident in the investments we have made in this important category and the continued progress on our long-term strategy. Adjusted operating margin in the Dental segment was 8.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which represents a 130-basis-point decrease over the prior year period.', 'Increased operating expenses related to our SAP implementation and warehouse expansion in Canada, along with investments in our software and technical service business, drove the unfavorable comparison in adjusted operating margin on a year-over-year basis. Now let’s move to our Animal Health segment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, internal sales for our Animal Health business decreased 1.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Internal sales for our total companion animal business during the quarter decreased 3.8% over the prior year period. Positive internal sales performance from our NBS business in the U.K. was more than offset by a decline in internal sales in the U.S. companion animal business. Internal sales for our Production Animal business in the fiscal third quarter increased 1.1% compared to the prior year period.', 'Our Production Animal team continues to execute well in a challenging market and our omnichannel approach across several species continues to pay off with sales growth above the overall market. The adjusted operating margin in our Animal Health segment was 4.4% in the fiscal 2024 third quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margins in our Animal Health segment were up in the fiscal 2024 third quarter and additional operating expense discipline drove the operating margin increase on a year-over-year basis. Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, our free cash flow improved by $11.9 million compared to the same period one year ago. This is primarily due to a decreased level of working capital in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period.', 'Now turning now to capital allocation. Our capital spending in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $51.2 million, which is $8.8 million higher than the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This increased spending reflects the investments we are making in our distribution capabilities, as well as software and value-added services. We continue to execute on a key capital allocation strategy of returning cash to our shareholders. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We also repurchased approximately $124 million of shares during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, returning a total of $148.8 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases.', 'And through the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we have returned $289.6 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Let me conclude with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. Today we are revising our fiscal 2024 GAAP earnings guidance to a range of $1.99 per diluted share to $2.04 per diluted share, and our adjusted earnings guidance range to $2.30 per diluted share to $2.35 per diluted share. We have made these revisions to our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share guidance to account for the current macroeconomic environment and aforementioned conditions in our end markets that we believe are likely to persist for the remainder of our fiscal 2024 year. And now I will turn the call back over to Don for some additional comments.', 'Don Zurbay: Thanks, Kevin. Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to thank the entire Patterson team for their continued hard work and commitment to our strategy of serving our customers. As we conclude fiscal 2024, we remain focused on navigating the current environment by staying true to our strategic objectives and achieving operational excellence. Our efforts are concentrated on executing to end our fiscal year in a position of strength. We are confident that the strength of our team, the resiliency of the Dental and Animal Health end markets, and our comprehensive value proposition make Patterson well-positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation over the long term. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I will be glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line.', 'Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.', 'Michael Cherny: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe if we can just start on equipment, both from a revenue growth perspective, as well as subsequent margins. I know this isn’t the first quarter you’ve talked about macro-oriented pressures, but obviously the trend on challenges in the equipment side have been challenging. As you think about not only ending the year but diving into 2025, how do you think about where your visibility stands, be it the health of the backlog, how you think about the backlog conversion rates, and what that means, especially as we kick off into 2025, knowing obviously full well you haven’t actually given a 2025 color yet?', 'See also Top 10 Uranium Producing Companies In The World and Top 20 Languages with the Hardest Grammar for English Speakers.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Finally reaching new highs in these instances -- just as the index did in January -- the market proceeded higher over the following year on 13 of these 14 occasions.', ""This surprising consistency in new bull markets should help ease investors' minds when buying stocks at these prices, as it suggests that the best is not necessarily behind us. One stock that has also recently reached new all-time highs is less-than-truckload specialist Old Dominion Freight Lines (NASDAQ: ODFL)."", 'Producing a total return of around 48,400% since the turn of the century, Old Dominion will split its stock 2-for-1 on March 17th -- marking its 7th split in the last 21 years.', ""As we near this upcoming date, here's why dollar-cost averaging into new company shares over time and holding for the long haul could be prudent for investors."", ""The most important thing to remember about stock splits is that nothing fundamentally changes with your investment. A company takes an eight-slice pizza (its shares) and cuts those slices in half, creating 16 new portions. Twice as many slices but ultimately, the same value for everyone. The size of the pizza -- or the business's market capitalization -- remains the same."", 'Despite this negligible effect on shareholders, stock splits increase liquidity on the exchanges while making shares more affordable for employees and outside investors. Though fractional-share trading is now fairly standard, not all brokers offer it.', ""For example, my Mom has a small E*TRADE account that does not allow fractional-share purchases on the individual stocks she buys. Adding $100 every month or two to her account, Old Dominion's current price of around $435 would be out of reach for her as she would rather put her cash to work elsewhere than let it accumulate. With the upcoming split, buying some Old Dominion would be much more feasible -- especially if she wanted to purchase multiple shares over time."", 'Better yet for investors, companies splitting their stocks have outperformed the market by 18% in the year following the split, according to a recent Nasdaq and FactSet study.', ""Home to nearly 11,000 trucks and over 46,000 trailers, Old Dominion is the largest less-than-truckload (LTL) motor carrier in the United States, holding a 12% share of the industry. Unlike traditional long-haul trucking, where a full trailer goes from one city to another, LTL shipping consists of packing numerous partial loads into a common trailer and delivering them to one of Old Dominion's distribution facilities for delivery. Naturally, the logistical infrastructure technology and know-how needed to make this possible are overwhelming, especially on a countrywide scale."", 'Despite these challenges, Old Dominion has steadily improved its unique operations and now delivers over 99% of its shipments on time, with only 0.1% of those deliveries containing an error. Generating these top-tier efficiencies while building out its immense grid of 257 service centers, the company has created a wide moat around its business thanks to its specialized network.', ""This moat can be somewhat quantified by viewing Old Dominion's high and rising return on invested capital (ROIC)."", ""A company's ROIC measures its profitability compared to its debt and equity -- the higher, the better. With the 31st-best ROIC in the S&P 500, Old Dominion's high marks could point to future outperformances. Propelled by this widening moat and rising ROIC, the company has grown revenue and net income by 12% and 25% annually over the last decade."", 'Armed with this burgeoning profitability, Old Dominion has repurchased over 10% of its outstanding shares in just the last five years -- all while quadrupling its dividend payments.', 'These shareholder-friendly actions also have a history of market-beating potential. Between 1973 and 2022, dividend-growth stocks like Old Dominion outperformed an equal-weighted S&P 500 index by 2.5 percentage points, according to a Hartford study. Meanwhile, analysis from S&P Global showed that a basket of the 100 most buyback-heavy stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the broader index in 16 of the 20 years from 2000 to 2019.', ""Cyclical in nature, the U.S. trucking industry remains in a temporary downturn, resulting in Old Dominion's sales declining 6% in 2023. Despite this drop, Chief Executive Officer Marty Freeman explained that the company has continued to take market share over the last few quarters as it absorbed new business from a now-bankrupt peer, Yellow."", ""Perhaps partially due to these market-share gains, the company's stock has held onto its premium valuation, trading at 34 times next year's earnings. Thanks to this combination of lofty valuation versus Old Dominion's wide moat and market-beating qualities, dollar-cost averaging purchases would be wise for investors. Buying smaller portions of shares over time (at a soon-to-be-lower share price), investors get to put skin in the game right away while also benefiting if a drop arrives amid this trough."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Old Dominion Freight Line right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Old Dominion Freight Line, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Old Dominion Freight Line wasn’t one of them.

In 2023, SpaceX launched rockets to orbit nearly 100 times, exceeding the performance of every rival on Earth -- up to and including the entire nation of China.', ""But one thing has bugged us from the beginning, and it's a question that we've asked ourselves several times over the years: How profitable is SpaceX?"", 'Today, we find out.', ""SpaceX is, of course, a private company. That means you can't easily invest in the stock (although you can invest in SpaceX indirectly). It also means that the SEC doesn't require the company to regularly update investors on its profits and losses, so it doesn't."", 'In a report released last month, however, space markets analyst Payload Space put together its ""educated best guess"" of SpaceX\'s finances based on reporting done by The Wall Street Journal and its own analysis. The numbers Payload worked up are not shockingly big -- not in the context of more established space stocks that are decades older than SpaceX. For example, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Lockheed Martin\'s (NYSE: LMT) space division did nearly $13 billion in work last year, while Boeing\'s (NYSE: BA) Defense, Space & Security business (only partly focused on space) approached $25 billion in revenue.', ""What is kind of shocking, however, is how fast SpaceX is growing relative to those two larger companies. From 2021 to 2023, Lockheed Martin's space revenue grew barely 6% -- and its profits decreased. At Boeing, both sales and earnings declined in the defense and space business. In contrast, at SpaceX, revenues have more than tripled over the last two years, even as the company appears to have flipped from a loss to a profit."", 'Here. See for yourself (with a hat tip to Payload Research for allowing the reprint):', 'These numbers may only be guesses. But if Payload is even in the ballpark, SpaceX outgrew its closest rival, Lockheed Martin (which, along with Boeing, owns half of the United Launch Alliance space company) by more than 270% over the last two years. Granted, Payload lacked sufficient information to be certain of how much SpaceX earned on that revenue. But later in the report, Payload says it\'s reasonably certain SpaceX\'s profits in 2023 were ""significant.""', 'And that makes it basically certain that those profits are, therefore, positive.', 'How did SpaceX flip from losses to profits in the space of just two years? You might think the answer is as simple as ""by launching more rockets."" But that wouldn\'t be entirely correct.', ""True, in 2021, SpaceX launched 31 times. True, in 2023, it launched 98 times -- more than three times as many flights. But fully 63 of SpaceX's launches in 2023 were Starlink missions, carrying the company's own satellites to orbit -- and generating essentially no revenue (from the launches, at least) for SpaceX. Flights for paying customers in 2023 increased hardly at all, and certainly not enough to explain a threefold increase in company revenue."", ""Rather, the reason SpaceX's revenue tripled through 2023 was what happened once those Starlink satellites reached space and began beaming down internet service to customers. As millions of subscribers began buying Starlink terminals and paying monthly for Starlink internet service, SpaceX's revenues boomed. In 2023, Payload calculates that SpaceX probably generated $830 million in revenue from selling Starlink terminals to customers and a further $3.3 billion in revenue from providing services through those terminals -- $4.2 billion in all."", ""That's more money than the $3.5 billion that SpaceX made from launching rockets!"", ""It's also worth noting that profit margins on providing internet service are much higher than the profit margins on launching rockets. Comcast, for example, reported 37.4% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins on its home internet business. SpaceX has indicated that it will be targeting 60% operating profit margins on Starlink once the business is operating at full scale."", ""SpaceX may have gotten its start as a rocket company. But as time goes by, and the Starlink satellite internet service continues to vastly outgrow the legacy rockets business, SpaceX will depend more and more on Starlink to drive both revenue growth and a huge growth in profits. The long-term goal, if you'll recall, is to get the company to $36 billion in revenue over the next few years -- which at 60% margins would imply roughly $22 billion in annual operating profit."", ""That's great news for SpaceX, and seeing as SpaceX has promised to IPO Starlink in the not-too-distant future, it's pretty great news for investors hoping to own a piece of Starlink as well."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lockheed Martin wasn’t one of them.

The Republic team finished the year strong by executing our strategy designed to profitably grow the business. We outpaced expectations throughout the year and deliver results that exceeded our full year guidance. During 2023, we achieved revenue growth of 11%, including 5% from acquisitions; generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 60 basis points, including margin expansion in the underlying business of 100 basis points; reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.61; and produced $1.99 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to believe that investing in value-creating acquisitions to further expand our business is the best use of our free cash flow.', 'We invested $1.8 billion in acquisitions in 2023, including transactions in both the recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Our efforts to provide industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth in the business.

We delivered outsized organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter with simultaneous increases in price and volume.', 'Core price and related revenue was 8.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.7%. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 40 basis points. Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continued to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and employees. Development of our new asset management system is underway, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhanced warranty recovery. We expect to begin utilizing the new system in late 2024. The continued operational enhancements supported by our RISE digital operations platform are expected to drive additional productivity through improved route optimization and safety performance and provide more predictable service delivery to our customers.', 'We anticipate the RISE platform will drive approximately $100 million of total annual earnings contribution, of which approximately $65 million has been realized to date. We continue to implement advanced technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfill containers and contamination and recycling containers. This technology is reducing contamination and driving incremental revenue. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewable natural gas are a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities remain on track. We are finalizing commissioning at our Las Vegas Polymer Center this week.', 'Delivery of plastic flake to our offtake partners is expected in the coming weeks. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Power Center. This development will be co-located with Blue Polymers production facility and construction at the site is expected to be completed in late 2024. The renewable gas projects being co-developed with our partners continue to advance. Five projects came online in 2023, and we expect at least eight additional projects to be completed in 2024. We continue to advance our efforts to support decarbonization, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 11 electric collection vehicles in operation. We expect more than 50 additional EVs will be added to our recycling and waste collection fleet in 2024.', 'We have six facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure, with more than 40 additional sites in various stages of development.

In 2023, employee engagement improved a score of 86 with 90% -- 99% of employees participating in the survey. Turnover rates continue to turn lower with full year turnover improving 400 basis points compared to the prior year.

More specifically, we expect full year revenue in a range of $16.1 billion to $16.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $4.825 billion to $4.875 billion. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.94 to $6, generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion. Our pipeline supports continued acquisition activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions.', 'We are targeting at least $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2024. Our 2024 financial guidance includes the rollover contribution from acquisitions that closed in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter and year.', 'Brian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.2% in the fourth quarter. Core price on related revenue was 8.8%, which included open market pricing of 10.6% and restricted pricing of 6%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.3%, large container of 8.6% and residential of 8.2%. Average yield on total revenue was 6.3% and average yield on related revenue was 7.7%. In 2024, we expect average yield on total revenue in a range of 5.5% to 6%. We expect average yield on related revenue in a range of 6.5% to 7%. Yield is expected to step down sequentially during 2024 due to relatively lower index-based pricing and certain fees implemented throughout 2023, which begin to anniversary.', 'Fourth quarter volume on total revenue increased 30 basis points and volume on related revenue increased 40 basis points. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 20 basis points and an increase in landfill of 7.4%. Landfill was primarily driven by a 12.7% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.4% and a decrease in landfill C&D volume of 2.1%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. In 2024, we expect organic volume growth in a range of flat to positive 50 basis points. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $131 per ton during the fourth quarter. This compared to $88 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 50 basis points during the quarter.', '2023 full year commodity prices were $117 per ton. This compared to $170 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $135 per ton, which is the baseline used in our 2024 guidance. Now turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 19.7%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 260 basis points to 29.9%, which was driven by margin expansion in the underlying business of 230 basis points. Other changes in margin performance during the quarter included a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point increase from net fuel, which was partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease from acquisitions.', 'Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.7%, which represents margin expansion of 60 basis points, compared to the prior year. In 2024, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 30%. We expect to more than overcome a 30 basis point headwind from acquisitions. Depreciation, amortization and accretion, was 10.7% of revenue in 2023 and is expected to be approximately 11% of revenue in 2024. Full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow was $1.99 billion, an increase of 14%, compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business and the positive contribution from changes in working capital. Total debt at the end of the year was $13 billion and total liquidity was $2.7 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 2.9 times.', 'We expect net interest expense of approximately $545 million in 2024. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.1% during the fourth quarter and 24.8% for the full year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 26% in 2024, made-up of an adjusted tax rate of 20% and approximately $190 million of non-cash charges from equity investments in renewable energy. The expected increase in interest expense and taxes would result in a $0.20 EPS headwind in 2024.

Spirit shares soared 15% in trading Friday on the reports. But shares had been down 10% from the time of the Alaska Air incident in early January through Thursday’s close, and down 70% since a March 2019 fatal crash of a Boeing 737 Max , which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.', 'Boeing sold Spirit in 2005, receiving $900 million in cash for the sale. Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems makes major parts of several Boeing models, including the fuselages for the 737 Max. The parts are then shipped to Boeing’s factory in Washington state via rail.', '“We believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems’ manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders,” Boeing said in a statement late Friday. ”Although there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement, we are committed to finding ways to continue to improve the safety and quality of the airplanes on which millions of people depend each and every day.”', 'Spirit has had its own series of quality control issues in recent years. The problems had become serious enough that Boeing had agreed to give it more money to try to improve Spirit’s quality and reliability issues there hurting Boeing’s own output. The payments came to an extra $60 million in revenue last year and $395 million in 2024 and 2025.', 'Those payments are an indication of Boeing’s motivation for a deal for Spirit. It can’t return to profitability itself unless problems at Spirit are also fixed. And it’s going to cost Boeing money to fix those problems, whether it is the largest customer, or the owner, of those operations.', 'About $3.9 billion of Spirit AeroSystems’ revenue last year came from Boeing, making up about 64% of its overall revenue. Boeing rival Airbus is Spirit’s second largest customer. It is unlikely that Boeing would be able hold onto that part of the business were it to reacquire Spirit.', 'Spirit’s market cap at the close of trading Friday, after shares had been lifted by the reports of a possible deal, stood at $3.7 billion, or just slightly less than what Boeing paid Spirit last year as its major supplier.

So even if Boeing was ultimately responsible for the problem, quality issues at Spirit may have also played a part.', 'The NTSB has yet to assess blame for the incident.', 'But the bolts have been just one of a series of quality issues at Spirit AeroSystems in recent years. Fuselages have been delivered to Boeing with work still needing to be done on them, which caused what is known as “out-of-sequence” work, which may have caused some of Boeing’s own quality issues.', 'In 2023 it used a “non-standard manufacturing process” when joining parts of the fuselages, causing a halt in deliveries of 737 Max jets.

While the FAA flagged the issues in a filing in mid-February, it drew greater attention on Friday because of a Seattle Times article.', 'The safety regulator continues to allow both models of the plane to fly despite the potential problems. Both issues are moving through the FAA’s standard process for developing airworthiness directives — rather than an emergency process — signaling that the agency and plane maker do not believe the issues are serious enough to require the planes to stop flying immediately.', 'Boeing issued a statement saying neither issue is “an immediate safety-of-flight concern based on extensive engineering analysis.”', '“Our extensive efforts to further improve airplane safety include systematically reviewing issues,” the company said.', 'But another safety issue is the last thing that Boeing needs at this moment, two months after a door plug on a 737 Max blew out on an Alaska Air flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet shortly after take-off. The Max has had a series of problems over the last five years, including two fatal crashes that between them killed 346 people in late 2018 and early 2019, which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.', 'While it might seem as if de-icing equipment is less important in summer months, the cold temperatures at high altitudes at which commercial jets fly, combined with the amount of moisture in clouds that they must fly through, make the de-icing equipment necessary twelve months a year.', '“You’re not protected by Mother Nature’s seasons,” said Dennis Tajer, an American Airlines pilot and a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association. “Airworthiness directives aren’t issued unless you have an unsafe condition that need to be addressed. It’s ominous. It may be manageable on a temporary basis. But it’s not a solution.”', 'The FAA said the newly disclosed Max issue could cause the jet’s engines to stop working. An electrical issue “could result in loss of thrust on both engines due to damage from operation in icing conditions.” The fix includes replacing wiring in a panel above the pilots’ heads.', 'The issue was discovered during a Boeing engineering analysis three years ago and is “a remote concern that has never been seen during decades of service” in both the current and previous generations of 737, said Jessica Kowal, a Boeing spokeswoman. The company said it disclosed the issue to airlines and the FAA at the time, and provided a fix.', 'The 2021 discovery lines up with the company’s order that year to ground some Max planes because of a different electrical problem. The Boeing Max — at the time, only recently back in service after the nearly two-year grounding prompted by two fatal crashes — underwent an extensive electrical system analysis.', 'Less than a week after publicly publishing the 737 Max notice, the FAA reported a separate anti-icing issue with the 787 Dreamliner. It said a damaged seal could cause heat damage to an engine inlet — and risk serious damage to the plane.', 'In 2018, an outer covering of an engine cowling that broke loose on an earlier version of a 737 jet shattered a window on a Southwest Airlines flight. The passenger sitting next to that window, Jennifer Riordan, 43, was expelled through the broken window. While other passengers were able to bring her back inside, she died as a result of blunt impact trauma of the head, neck and torso.', 'Boeing is working on redesigning the part on the 787 Dreamliner engine to prevent further issues, Kowal said. The issue was discovered on fewer than two dozen of over 1,000 Dreamliners in service, she said.', 'The FAA described neither issue as a production quality problem — which is its current focus at Boeing following the January in-flight blowout.', 'The FAA orders have not yet taken effect, but said they would apply to about 315 planes, including both Maxes and Dreamliners.', 'Boeing drew criticism from lawmakers after the January 737 Max mid-flight blowout for having asked the FAA to certify new models of the 737 Max despite a different flaw in the anti-ice system. The company ultimately withdrew that request, which will delay its plans to deliver the new planes to its airline customers.', 'But it continues to build existing models of the jet with the same engine de-icing flaw that is delaying certification of the next Max versions.', 'In addition to the de-icing equipment issue, Boeing has been stung by numerous questions about the quality and safety procedures at its factories.', 'The National Transportation Safety Board is looking into the causes of the incident and already found that four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were missing when the plane left a Boeing factory in October.', 'The FAA is also demanding that Boeing come up with a plan to improve its quality controls for its aircraft manufacturing.', 'And the Justice Department is investigating whether the incident is a violation of a settlement it reached in 2021 to defer prosecution on charges that it defrauded the FAA during the original certification of the 737 Max before two fatal crashes resulted in a 20-month grounding of the plane.', 'The NTSB has yet to determine blame or fault for the door plug incident on the Alaska Air flight. That will come later in its investigation, perhaps a year or more from now. But Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors in January, “We caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

So I think it's probably, you know, Boeing management looked deep inside Spirit, thought about how they were going to fix the quality problems with the 737. You know, really, the path to higher profitability, higher cash flow of Boeing is driven all through 737 build rates rising. And I think they thought that the quickest path to quality and a higher build rates was through buying Spirit AeroSystems. And so that's what they're in the middle of doing, it sounds like."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Ben, I want to get your take on this as well. And also, what the chances are that regulators, who are already separately looking into each of these companies, would approve a deal like this?', ""BEN TSOCANOS: Well, I think it's a little early, but I would say that the biggest obstacle that's been, I think, discussed is the fact that Spirit also makes products for competitor Airbus. So I think they would have to resolve that issue. I would guess that if it's gotten to this point, then some thought has been given to that and that there's some path to resolving that."", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: What do you make of-- staying with you here. What do you make of Boeing continuing to search for options in terms of partnerships, acquisitions? Is this an effort to shore up their supply chain?', ""BEN TSOCANOS: Well, I think that the spin-off of Spirit has been part of the-- has been an obstacle, I think, to improving production over the last-- certainly over the last year. So I think that it's an indication of the limits of outsourcing. And I think that by bringing Spirit back into the insourcing of the company, I think that it would certainly simplify the quality control process."", ""JULIE HYMAN: George, you know, so does this-- it seems like it sort of increases degrees of complexity though, if they're trying to do this deal at the same time that they're trying to solve these issues. So does it, I mean, is it a sort of walking and chewing gum at the same time? Or does it, to the other point, kind of help solve that problem?"", ""GEORGE FERGUSON: So, I don't think Boeing management would undertake this if they didn't think it was absolutely critical to getting quality right in the supply chain. And so, there is, I think, a layer of complexity because they're in the middle of trying to do a deal here. But I do think their ability to go into their major supplier for the 737, and make sure that processes are done correctly, make sure training and oversight is done correctly, outweighs the challenge of having to manage a transaction."", ""I mean, I agree. I think they'll need to get rid of some of the Airbus business. I think there's probably investment bankers already working on selling some of those businesses off to other companies that may want to add it to their portfolio.

U.S. aviation regulators have already curbed production and air carriers have been in discussion for more aircraft deliveries with its bigger rival, Airbus.', ""Reuters reported last month that years of decentralization of Boeing's planemaking capacity — along with an exodus of experienced workers and aggressive cost-cutting — has affected quality. Bringing Spirit back into the fold could address some of those quality issues as it would give Boeing more control over manufacturing."", 'Spirit was spun off in 2005 and in recent years has struggled with cost pressures and problems that have slowed aircraft deliveries and thinned its balance sheet. The company has hired bankers and has had preliminary discussions with Boeing, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Friday.', ""Such a move could also help Boeing lower Spirit's production costs, a senior industry source told Reuters. Boeing had previously considered repurchasing Spirit AeroSystems, but the optics of buying back at a higher price discouraged such a move, the source said."", ""However, Spirit's shares have fallen 70% over the last five years, and its $3.3 billion market value is far short of Boeing's $124 billion."", '""Boeing probably realizes that divesting its Wichita operations that make up the core of Spirit AeroSystems was a strategic mistake,"" Scott Mikus, equity research associate at Melius Research said.', 'Shares of Spirit AeroSystems closed up 15% on Friday in regular trading and were up 2% after hours. Boeing closed down 1.8% and were flat post market.', 'BOEING AND REGULATORS', 'The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in late January barred Boeing from increasing production of the 737 MAX as it presses for changes.', ""On Feb. 12, FAA head Mike Whitaker visited Boeing's Renton, Washington, factory, where the 737 MAX line is produced, and expressed concerns about some things he saw on the tour to CEO Dave Calhoun earlier this week, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters."", ""According to Boeing's latest 737 supplier master schedule seen by Reuters, the company had to delay plans to increase production from 38 to 42 aircraft per month to June, from the initial target date of February. Boeing has also pushed back subsequent production increases throughout 2024 and 2025."", ""Spirit, one of the industry's major manufacturers of large aircraft structures, has struggled with cash flow problems over the past few quarters and quality issues surrounding the fuselages it makes for Boeing's 737 narrowbody jets."", 'The company is also exploring selling operations in Ireland that makes wings for the Airbus A220 jet, as it would be unusual for Boeing to supply its competitor.', '""For Boeing, this does give them the opportunity to bring Spirit in-house and fix its problems, but Boeing of course has its own issues and has hardly covered itself with glory when it comes to execution of late,"" said Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard.', 'Investigators are still trying to definitively sort out responsibility for the Jan. 5 incident.

That's driving blistering growth for leading-edge chips developed by companies like Nvidia. The hardware and software needed to power AI applications require lots of electricity. According to some estimates, AI data center racks require seven times more power than traditional ones, which already use a massive amount of electricity. "", 'Power-hungry AI applications help drive the view that the U.S. will need a lot more electricity in the future. While renewable energy will play a key role in helping power AI data centers, intermittency and other issues suggest it will need some help carrying the load. That opens the door for nuclear energy to help fuel the AI megatrend.', ""Data centers are already power-hungry facilities. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, they consume 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical office building. These facilities currently use 2% of the country's electricity. "", 'That percentage will grow significantly by the end of this decade, with AI potentially enhancing demand:', ""As that slide shows, data centers could consume up to 7.5% of the country's electricity by 2030 at the high case for generative AI. That's on top of the accelerating demand from the growing adoption of electric vehicles, the electrification of heating (i.e., heat pumps), and other drivers. These factors will cause U.S. electricity demand to grow twice as fast through 2030 as it did over the previous decade. "", ""At the same time power demand is surging, the country is racing to reduce its carbon emissions by retiring coal-fired power plants. While that will drive robust growth in renewable energy, the intermittency issues of solar and wind could impact the grid's reliability. Because of that, the country will need more baseload power sources like battery storage, natural gas, and nuclear."", 'Given its ability to produce emissions-free baseload power, nuclear could play an increasingly crucial role in helping the country meet its future power needs. That could fuel strong growth for companies focused on the energy source.\xa0', ""For example, Southern Company (NYSE: SO) recently completed Plant Vogtle Unit 3, the country's first newly constructed nuclear unit in over three decades. Southern Company is currently working to finish Unit 4. It invested over $10 billion into building these projects, which should produce growing cash flow in the coming decades as power prices rise. That will give the utility more fuel to increase its dividend and invest in meeting the country's growing energy needs. "", ""Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG) is the country's nuclear energy leader. It has the most competitive nuclear generating capacity and is the best operator in the sector. That gives it a strong and growing earnings base with upside to higher power prices. "", 'It has already started tapping into powering data centers by agreeing to supply Microsoft with power for one of its data centers. Constellation estimates that its growth drivers will increase its base earnings by more than 10% annually through 2028. That should give it the power to deliver robust dividend growth (it recently boosted its payout by 25%). ', 'Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) is a global leader in renewable energy and sustainability solutions. It expanded its capabilities into nuclear last year by closing its strategic partnership with leading uranium fuel provider Cameco to acquire leading nuclear service company Westinghouse. That business generates stable cash flow from service contracts. ', ""Meanwhile, it has significant growth potential, including servicing the rising demand from new nuclear power plants. That could enhance Brookfield's growth in the coming years. "", 'AI data centers are power-hungry facilities, which means electricity demand in the country could soar by the end of the decade as technology companies build more data centers to support this emerging technology.

If you want to skip our introduction to the global space industry and all the latest news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Valuable Space Companies in the World. ', ""Just as high technology industries such as genetic engineering and artificial intelligence have rapidly grown at levels that would have been thought unimaginable at the turn of this century, space exploration is another sector that has rapidly captured the public imagination. While space has always been a popular endeavor, after the Space Shuttle's retirement, the U.S. space industry slowed down at least as far as launch vehicle development is concerned. After the Shuttle, while rockets such as the United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Atlas lineup continued to launch top secret national security payloads, the heart of space exploration — crewed missions to low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond — took place only from Russia."", ""However, ever since SpaceX successfully flew the Crew Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS) with NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, the Kennedy Space Center in Florida has been bustling with activity. At the same time, other crewed spacecraft commissioned by the space agency have also been developing their spacecraft. While SpaceX's Crew Dragon remains the only U.S. spacecraft certified by NASA for orbital spaceflight, the other spacecraft currently being developed for NASA contracts is The Boeing Company's (NYSE:BA) Starliner. Additionally, Sierra Space is developing its Dream Chaser space plane, initially for NASA cargo contracts."", ""This intermix of private space companies vying for NASA awards is also the 21st century version of the space agency. For the U.S. space industry, NASA's operating model prior to Shuttle's retirement saw the agency engage itself with its private space company contractors during every step of a vehicle's design. Once the design was finished and the end product went through multiple tests certifying it for flight, NASA took ownership of the vehicle and operated it on its now."", ""Now, the most valuable space companies in the world are those that are capable of operating their own rockets and serving the needs of a myriad of government and private sector contractors in addition to the world's leading space agency. In fact, the extent to which this principle has taken hold over the space industry is evident by the fact that you really didn't have to read this piece to know which company is the most valuable space company in the world. SpaceX is a household name by now, and it's the biggest space company in the world as far as market capitalization is concerned."", ""While we'll get to SpaceX's market capitalization later, the firm's dominance in the launch vehicle industry is clear by the fact that February 2024 marked a unique achievement for the company and the global space industry. This is because in mid February, before SpaceX launched a mission for the U.S. Space Force, the firm became the only one in human history to have had four rockets vertical at four launch pads. While SpaceX's rocket launch for the space force was ready for lift off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, it was ready to launch NASA payloads on an Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) lunar lander, had placed the Falcon 9 vertical for a Starlink launch from California and stacked the Starship second stage spacecraft on the Super Heavy booster in Boca Chica, Texas."", ""This latest tryst came when the space company stock NASDAQ:LUNR soared by double digit percentages on the stock market. Why did Intuitive Machines's shares soar? Well, its Nova C Odysseus lunar lander marked America's second attempt to land a lander on the Moon since the Apollo era. The first attempt had come earlier this year, when Pittsburgh based Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander kicked off the NASA Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, but Intuitive Machines's lunar lander seemed to have caught investors' eyes since it promises to make a lunar landing attempt in just a week after its launch."", ""The Intuitive Machines Odysseus lunar lander will use a methane powered rocket engine for its journey to the Moon, and the firm successfully managed early post launch complications by feeding new commands to the lander's guidance and navigation systems from Earth."", ""The Odysseus launch coupled with the SpaceX Starship and NASA Artemis programs marks a new era for space companies stocks. It also means that companies like SpaceX have started to become like NASA in their operations. Prior to the Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon, NASA's crewed launches were managed by the agency's controllers. Now, SpaceX is responsible for the astronauts' journey to the station, and this is not through accident. When it comes to private space companies vs NASA, the space agency also finds it easier to scale up human spaceflight programs by offshoring some of the risks involved in sending humans at speeds of thousands of kilometers per hour in the Earth's atmosphere and into space. While NASA's Space Shuttle program completed 133 successful flights over three decades, its two notable accidents that led to the demise of all crew on board are still the biggest criticism that its detractors have."", ""Finally, before we take the wraps off of the most valuable and biggest space companies in the world, it's important to note that while firms such as SpaceX and Boeing are among the most widely discussed space stocks, the sector as a whole is quite diversified. Broadly speaking, space stocks can be divided into two categories. The first is of firms that make space vehicles like SpaceX's Falcon 9, Boeing's Starliner and SLS for NASA, and Intuitive Machines' Odysseus. The second belongs to satellite companies such as Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT) whose bread and butter is based on operating imaging, telecommunications, and other satellites. Of course, before anyone points out, SpaceX is also a satellite company since its Starlink satellite internet constellation is now made of nearly six thousand small telecommunications satellites."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the most valuable space companies in the world. In this list, some notable space stocks that are publicly available for trading are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.

ZION's P/B has been as high as 1.70 and as low as 0.62, with a median of 1.06, over the past year."", ""Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. ZION has a P/S ratio of 1.26. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.77."", ""Finally, we should also recognize that ZION has a P/CF ratio of 6.86.

We have some very important new clinical data to share on the call today well, which we think is highly relevant to our current first-line metastatic colorectal cancer program. As you may be aware, last year, we made a highly consequential decision to shift our mCRC program from the second line to the first-line setting. There were three factors that drove our decision. The first was the clinical signal from our second-line mCRC trial. The second was the new mechanism of action we discovered for onvansertib. And the third was a strong support from the FDA for the first-line clinical development plan. What's new today is that, for the first time, we are releasing data from our ONSEMBLE trial, adding powerful support to our first-line strategy. And as we'll discuss what's different with the ONSEMBLE clinical data is that it's independent, it's randomized, and its perspective. You'll hear more about each of these attributes today and by the end, I hope you agree that ONSEMBLE data adds substantial support for our first-line program. So let's dive in. Slide 2 shows the three topics I will cover on today's call. First, we'll talk briefly about 2023 and what a transformational year it has been for Cardiff Oncology and for the clinical development of our drug, onvansertib. Secondly, as I mentioned, we'll share clinical data from our randomized second line on ONSEMBLE trial. And then finally, we'll talk about our financial position that we disclosed today in our Form 10-K. On slide 4, we show the highlights of the significant announcements we made in 2023. In August, we provided our mCRC clinical update, where we announced the discovery of a novel mechanism of action for onvansertib, which was previously unknown and the clinical level that plays in the HIF1-alpha pathway inhibiting fast utilization of terminals. The data we presented showing evidence of complementary mechanisms of action for onvansertib and bevacizumab, which we will refer to as bev, could explain the strength of our clinical data in mCRC. And after discussing the clinical and underlying mechanism with the FDA in June of last year, we received strong support for the decision to move our program to the first first-line setting. Further, we announced with Pfizer, through its Pfizer Ignite program, is providing clinical execution for the CRDF-004 trial. At the time we made all these decisions, we were already enrolling patients in some trials in the ONSEMBLE trial in the second-line setting. So in August, we announced we would discontinue the trial to focus our efforts and resources on the larger patient population and the significant unmet need in the first-line setting. In September of last year, we held a second update call to announce data for our programs outside of mCRC. From our second-line pancreatic cancer trial, we announced four initial partial responses from the 21 patients. And today we can provide an update on those four patients by sharing the three of the four initial responses were confirmed on a subsequent scan. We also announced our decision to shift our pancreatic program to a first-line setting with an investigator-initiated trial combining onvansertib with standard of care gem Abraxane. Finally, we announced new data from our refractory extensive-stage small lung cancer, investigator-initiated trial where we observed a confirmed PR among the first seven patients. Importantly, this is the first clinical data generated using onvansertib as a single agent. Looking at the range of our announcements in 2023, you can believe that the year was truly transformational for Cardiff Oncology. I'm -- just have this break for a second. I'm sorry but I am losing my voice. So I need to ask my CFO, James, to take continue with remarks on the call. I'll be available for Q&A at the end of the call. Thank you."", 'James Levine', ""Thanks, Mark. On slide 5, we transition to our second item on the agenda, the new clinical data we're announcing today. Recall that our mCRC program includes three clinical trials, and we want to very clearly discuss what's significant in each one. The Phase 1b/2 trial in KRAS-mutated mCRC generated the initial signal of efficacy on which we based our mCRC clinical development program and the trial is now complete. Based on the strength of the preliminary data from the single-arm Phase 1b/2 trial, we proceeded with our originally designed next step of our clinical development program by implementing the second line ONSEMBLE trial which would provide randomized data comparing onvansertib plus standard of care to standard of care alone. However, as the Phase 1b/2 data matured, we saw a powerful and unexpected positive signal from the data. We identified a subgroup of patients, specifically those who had not had prior treatment with bev in the first-line setting that achieved higher response rates than what would have been expected. As we state on slide 8, we discussed our findings, including both the Phase 1b/2 clinical data and the new mechanism of action I mentioned at the start of the call with the FDA, which led to their strong support for us to discontinue the ONSEMBLE trial and shift our clinical program to the first-line setting. CRDF-004 is our randomized first-line RAS-mutated mCRC trial, for which we just announced the first patient was dosed, and Pfizer Ignite is providing clinical execution. As you see on slide 9, today, we are sharing new clinical data from the CRDF-003 ONSEMBLE trial. We had enrolled 23 patients in ONSEMBLE prior to making the decision to discontinue this trial. While we closed the trial to new enrollment, those patients who are already enrolled continued treatment for protocol and the majority of the patients enrolled remain on the trial today. As you'll see, there are important findings in the ONSEMBLE clinical data that validate our decision to shift to the first line. I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Fairooz Kabbinavar, our Chief Medical Officer, to review our clinical data. As a reminder, Dr. Kabbinavar is a medical oncologist with 35 years of experience who led the colorectal cancer program at UCLA, and he was heavily involved in the registrational trials that led to the approval of bev in metastatic colorectal cancer."", 'Fairooz Kabbinavar', ""Thank you, Jamie, and thank you, Mark. It's my pleasure to present the new randomized clinical data from our CRDF-003 ONSEMBLE trial. On slide 10, you can see the ONSEMBLE trial design. This trial enrolled second-line RAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer patients with unresectable, but measurable disease. Patients are randomized across three arms. One was a control arm where patients received standard of care chemotherapy consisting of FOLFIRI plus bev. In the two experimental arms, patients received a dose of onvansertib in each of the first five days following the FOLFIRI plus bev infusion. One arm included a 20-milligram daily dose of onvansertib. The other arm included a 30-milligram daily dose of onvansertib. The primary end point was objective response rate, and the dosing schedule was the same as in our Phase 1b/2 trial. Looking at the enrollment at the top of slide 11, you can see that at the time down ONSEMBLE trial was discontinued, 23 patients have been randomized across the three arms. Importantly, one patient was never treated because a patient withdrew consent and left the trial prior to receiving any therapy. This reduces the treated patient population available for safety to 22 patients only. Also one additional patient withdrew consent and left the trial before receiving any post baseline scan. So 21 of the 23 patients were not evaluable for efficacy. Both patients who left the trial were randomized to the control arm and both were bev-exposed, so the withdrawal from the trial does not impact any of the conclusions drawn from the data on the following slides. On slide 12, I'd like to define exactly what we mean by bev-naive and bev-exposed. In our second line mCRC patients -- trials, enrolled patients would have already received first-line therapy that may or may not have included bev. A bev-naive patient is simply a patient whose prior therapy did not include bev. So these patients -- so these patients would have received only FOLFOX chemotherapy in their first-line treatment before coming into our second-line trial. In our second-line ONSEMBLE trial 7 of our 21 patients evaluable for efficacy were bev-naive. We refer to the other 14 evaluable patients in our trial as bev-exposed, meaning the prior first-line therapy included bev in addition to FOLFOX chemotherapy. So the critical question we had is we work on the ONSEMBLE trial did it mature over the past six months there? Will the high response rates with sulfur bev-naive patients in our Phase 1b/2 single-arm trial continued to be observed in the ONSEMBLE randomized trial? And I'm excited to show you the results on the next slide. Slide 13 is the waterfall plot which shows each patient's best response to therapy over the course of the treatment. As you can see, the answer to my question, the bev-naive patients receiving onvansertib with FOLFIRI plus bev, once again, have the most robust response to treatment. Now allow me to walk you through what this slide is showing. Starting from the top of the slide, you can see that we have segregated the 21 evaluable patients into two groups. So the seven bev-naive patients are on the left, the 14 bev-exposed patients are on the right, with each of these cohorts -- within each of these cohorts, we further divide the data into external arm patients who received onvansertib plus standard of care FOLFIRI plus bev and the control arm patients on FOLFIRI plus bev without onvansertib. Looking at the graph, the bars above the midline represent tumor growth and the bars below the midline represent tumor shrinkage. A teal-colored bar represents an objective partial response meaning the patient had 30% of greater reduction in the tumor size. A light red bar represents progressive disease, which is an increase of more than 20% in the tumor size. And a yellow bar represents a stable disease, which is between these two numbers. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the dose of onvansertib received by each experimental arm patients, either patients -- either 20 milligrams or 30 milligrams shown in blue boxes above the patient number. And the first three digits of the patient number is a clinical trial site number. As you scan from left to right on the waterfall plot, you can see that the three patients with the greatest tumor shrinkage observed our bev-naive patients receiving onvansertib plus standard of care. This is highly encouraging and consistent with what we would have expected based on our prior Phase 1b/2 trial data. On the next few slides, we'll pass this waterfall plot into sections and draw additional conclusions. As we call out on slide 14, you can see that for the bev-naive patients, the only objective responses were observed -- we observed were in patients that received standard of care plus onvansertib. Given this is a randomized trial, it's also important to point out and we did not see any responses in the control arm of bev-naive patients that received standard of care alone without onvansertib. In addition, by looking at the first three digits of each patient number, you can see that each bev-naive patient was enrolled at a different trial site so that the bev-naive finding is not the result of any bias coming out of a single trial site. Specifically in the bev-naive patients that did respond, one patient received onvansertib demonstrated a 44% reduction in the tumor size and the second patient had a 43% reduction. Importantly, both these patients have confirmed partial responses, and we see these partial responses at both 20 milligrams and 30-milligram dose of onvansertib. A third bev-naive patient who received onvansertib had a 20% reduction in the tumor size, which is very close to the 30% threshold to qualify for a partial response. I would like you to keep this patient in your mind as I'll provide more details in the next few slides. On slide 15, we focus on the 14 patients in the bev-exposed cohort, and you can see that in both the experimental and control arms, there were no objective responses observed. And certainly, the size of effect appears to be less than what we see in the bev-naive cohort. And on slide 16, you can see that the bev-naive and bev-exposed control arm patients appear to have very similar responses to the standard of care therapy. On slide 17, we are looking at the spider plots on the bev-naive patients. You can see that on the left, our patients in the experimental arm. The teal lines in the plot allow you to see the trajectory of the two patients with confirmed partial responses. The plot on the right shows the bev-naive control arm patients who did not receive onvansertib. Importantly, the two control arm patients with tumor shrinkage at their two months can both subsequently progressed at their four-month scan and left the trial. Now on slide 18, I'd like to provide some context around the patient I mentioned earlier, who had a 27% reduction in the tumor size at the six-month scan. On this six-month scan, a suspicious new metastatic lesion was noted in the patient's lung. So the treating physician decided to discontinue onvansertib but continue treating the patient with standard of care FOLFIRI plus bev. The lung lesion was later confirmed via biopsy to be a Valley fever fungal infection, unrelated to the patient's cancer, and not a new tumor lesion. And the patient's eight-month scan, the tumors increased sufficiently for it to be considered progressive disease. But more importantly, during this two-month period between the six-month and eight-month scan when the tumor progress, the patient was not receiving any onvansertib, but was only on FOLFIRI plus bev. In summary, on slide 19, I'd like to reiterate the three attribute to the ONSEMBLE data that Mark and Jamie mentioned at the start of the call now that you have seen all the data. First, the ONSEMBLE trial was independent because it's a second clinical trial at a different point in time than our earlier Phase 1b/2 trial, showing once again that bev-naive patients have a strong response to therapy that includes onvansertib with FOLFIRI and bev. Second, the ONSEMBLE trial was a randomized trial. Thereby removing all clinical bias, where we see that bev-naive patients in the control arm of FOLFIRI plus bev without onvansertib had no objective responses. And finally, the ONSEMBLE trial was prospectively designed. The original bev-naive finding in the Phase 1b/2 trial was from a retrospective look back at the data. However, we have seen the bev-naive signal before enrolling the ONSEMBLE trial and had prospectively planned to value the differences in response rates between the bev-naive and bev-exposed patients in a randomized fashion. And importantly, when we look at the safety data that is included in the appendix of this material, we see that onvansertib, when combined with chemotherapy plus bev, is well tolerated with no major unexpected toxicity that was observed. On slide 20, I'll conclude my remarks reminding you of the new mechanism of action we discovered for onvansertib and that Mark mentioned at the start of the call. This mechanism of action explains why we believe we are seeing this clear efficacy signal in bev-naive patients. As we discussed in detail in August, we believe that the robust responses we are seeing are due to a novel mechanism of action that we have discovered for onvansertib's role in the hypoxia response pathway. It is well known the tumors outgrow their blood supply and become hypoxic, meaning they become starve of oxygen and nutrients. Tumors respond to this hypoxic stress by producing the HIF-1 alpha protein. HIF stands for a hypoxia-inducible factor I alpha protein, which tells on hundreds of genes that allow the tumor to survive in the hypoxic environment. One of those mechanisms involve with tumor secreting vascular endothelial growth factor A, VEGFA, to promote the formation of creation of new blood vessels to bring oxygen and nutrients to the cancer cell. As you can see on slide 21, bev works by neutralizing VEGFA, inhibiting the creation of new vasculature. But onvansertib plays a role upstream of VEGF by inhibiting HIF1-alpha directly and thereby blocking all its downstream effects. This shows while onvansertib and bev are complementary in a bev-naive setting, by deploying two separate HIFs on the tumor angiogenic pathway and its survival mechanisms. In conclusion, in my 35 years as a medical oncologist, I've never been as excited as I am now to see the kind of efficacy signal we are observing across our clinical trials. Now I'm going to hand this call back over to Jamie to continue the discussion further. Jamie?"", 'James Levine', ""Thank you, Fairooz. We'll conclude the call with a few comments about CRDF-004. Turning now to slide 23, you can see that colorectal cancer is a major public health issue. It's both a highly prevalent form of cancer and it is challenging to treat. And recently, there have been a number of reports that CRC is becoming more common in younger adults, thus increasing our responsibility to develop more effective therapies beyond the current standard of care. And on the right side of the slide, you can see how our decision to move from second line to first line substantially increases the number of metastatic colorectal cancer patients who may benefit from adding onvansertib to the current standard of care. On slide 24, you can see that the first-line standard of care for RAS-mutated mCRC consists only of chemotherapy with bev, a regimen that hasn't changed in 20 years. So this large patient population is in need of new therapies directed at all RAS mutations. Slide 25 provides the study design for our CRDF-004 trial. Similar to the ONSEMBLE trial, CRDF 004 includes mCRC patients whose tumors have a RAS mutation and are unresectable. A key difference for CRDF-004 is that all patients are first line and therefore, have not previously been exposed to bev. The trial will randomize 90 patients across three arms: first, a control arm consisting of standard of care with FOLFIRI bev or FOLFOX bev, and then two experimental arms looking at standard of care chemotherapy plus bev and a 20-milligram or a 30-milligram daily dose of onvansertib, the same doses as in the ONSEMBLE trial. Our primary endpoint for the trial will be objective response rate and the secondary endpoints are duration of response and progression-free survival. Let me provide a few additional details about the CRDF-004 enrollment. Our clinical operations efforts, together with Pfizer Ignite are going well with a critical mass of 20 clinical trial sites activated as of today. And as we announced, we've dosed our first patient. Based on the current robust screening activity observed and our current enrollment projections, we expect to meet our goal of releasing data from the trial in mid-2024. And we anticipate this initial release will include objective response rate data for approximately half the patients we expect to enroll in the trial. On slide 26, I'll cover our third agenda item, our financial position as of December 31, 2023. As we disclosed today in our Form 10-K filing, we had $74.8 million in cash and investments as of December 31, 2023. And our cash used in operating activities was $7.1 million in Q4 '23. Today, we have greater clarity on our expected future expenses, and so we can be more precise about our forecasted cash runway. Specifically, we believe that our current cash resources provide us with cash runway into the third quarter of 2025, which is beyond the expected readout from the CRDF 004 trial. Finally, on slide 27, we summarize why the ONSEMBLE data we released today is so relevant for our first-line mCRC strategy and our ongoing CRDF-004 trial. First, ONSEMBLE is the second independent and randomized data set reproducing the robust efficacy signal for onvansertib plus standard of care in bev-naive patients, and this supports our currently enrolling first-line trial where all patients are bev-naive. Secondly, no bev-naive patients in the ONSEMBLE control arm showed an objective response to treatment without onvansertib, suggesting onvansertib is critical to the robust responses observed in the experimental arm. And finally, both of the two onvansertib doses appear to be active, which suggests the two experimental arms of the CRDF-004 trial could be combined when evaluating the trial data for efficacy. For all these reasons, we continue to believe our shift to the first-line setting is the best strategy for all of our stakeholders, particularly the large number of patients, 48,000 per year in the US with RAS-mutated mCRC that may benefit from a new approach to treating their disease. With that, we'll open the call up for questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Marc Frahm, TD Cowen.', 'Marc Frahm', ""Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the data that you're able to release. But maybe first off, just obviously, just the first patient today, but any sense for how much data you'll be able to release in the middle of the year from the 004 trial? And then for the data today from ONSEMBLE, any characteristics you can provide on the baseline, like were there any differences in like left and right sidedness and things like that, that might explain a little bit of the difference in response rate."", 'Mark Erlander', ""I can start. First of all, like we said on the call, we're going to be putting data out when we have approximately about half of the patients enrolled in the trial. And the second thing was regarding the ONSEMBLE data. We have looked at that. We haven't seen any differences, but we come from the side of this, but we -- but we did not present that here."", 'Marc Frahm', ""Okay. And sorry, just on that update, is that once you've enrolled or that you have mature response data on half? That's the question."", 'Mark Erlander', ""Where we're looking is at least one scan after the baseline."", 'Marc Frahm', ""Okay. Thanks. That's helpful."", 'Operator', 'Joseph Catanzaro, Piper Sandler.', 'Joseph Catanzaro', ""Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions and the update here. But maybe first on the ONSEMBLE data. I'm wondering if you guys performed a PFS analysis. I'm looking at the swimmer plot even considering both bev-naive and bev-exposed, it feels like there's a pretty good, even maybe emerging, PFS signal that you're seeing in this randomized data. So I'm wondering if you did that analysis and maybe what it's saying. Thanks and I have maybe one follow-up."", 'Mark Erlander', 'Thanks, Joe, for that question. We have not intended it rigorously. We were waiting for more follow-up for us to look at that since there is a small number of patients, but we agree with you that it looks like there is an emerging signal.', 'Joseph Catanzaro', ""Okay. Thanks. And then for the frontline trial, was there any safety running on the backbone of FOLFOX? Just trying to get a sense of maybe historically how the neutropenia compares with FOLFOX relative to FOLFIRI and then maybe relatedly, the expected split between FOLFIRI and FOLFOX as the backbone. I'm thinking back to some earlier preclinical data from a couple of years back that suggested on onvansertib and irinotecan, there's some cooperativity there. So hopefully, that question makes sense."", 'Mark Erlander', ""Yeah. Joe, let me first start by talking about the preclinical data. We actually have shown publicly that we have synergy with both oxaliplatin as well as irinotecan in (inaudible) model preclinically, and we have not seen any toxicity as well. For your questions regarding the FOLFOX in our first line trial, I'm going to turn it over to Fairooz, our CMO here."", 'Fairooz Kabbinavar', ""Hi, Joe. So the question about regarding any safety run-in for the FOLFOX bev plus onvansertib. Yes, for the first nine patients will be -- the first nine patients that we dosed, those patients will be evaluated by the safety review committee. And once we -- it is determined that FOLFOX plus onvansertib plus bev, there's no additional toxicity beyond what is expected of FOLFOX bev, then that arm will continue to accrue to its full completion of the full complement of the patients. So yes, there is a safety valve built into this trial. And we don't expect, based on how onvansertib partners with other chemotherapy drugs, we don't expect any major toxicity issues. And even the -- and giving you a lot more detailed information, even though there were two patients with neutropenia that was seen in the ONSEMBLE trial was at the lower end -- lower dose at 20 milligrams, not at 30 milligrams, and then these patients that neutropenia resolved just by holding the treatment or delaying the treatment for seven in one patient -- seven days and another patient 10 days. And those patients still continue on treatment without any of those reductions."", 'Joseph Catanzaro', ""Okay. Thank you. That's all very, very helpful. Thanks again for taking my question."", 'Operator', 'Andy Hsieh, William Blair.', 'Andy Hsieh', 'Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Mark, I hope you feel better soon.', 'Mark Erlander', 'Thank you.', 'Andy Hsieh', ""I want to dig a little -- just want to dig a little deeper on ONSEMBLE top-line results. Maybe on two topics. One is on liver metastases and maybe second on dose response. Maybe I'll go first on the dose response. Maybe perhaps you could comment on whether you see some sort of dose response, or both are active? And how do you think about those doses going forward. Specifically on the liver metastases, I think if I did the calculation right, it's about 77% of the patients have some sort of liver metastases. That's kind of on the higher side. Have you looked at the two responders? Do they have liver metastases and I think the emerging data is suggesting that these patients are particularly hard to treat. And maybe there's a potential hypothesis on the mechanistic side of onvansertib that's active in this population. And a couple of follow-ups."", 'Mark Erlander', ""Okay. Well, thanks, Andy. For the dose response, if I understood your question correctly, we are seeing similar activity, albeit small data numbers, but we are seeing similar activity between the two doses, the 20 mg and the 30 mg if that's what you're asking."", 'Andy Hsieh', ""Yeah. That's right."", 'Mark Erlander', ""And from that, that's why we're concluding that we can combine those arms together to look at efficacy in the 004 trial. As far as the liver met, we have not analyzed that robustly yet. But I would say that in our Phase 1b/2 trial, we showed that there was no difference in the response in bev-naive patients who had liver met versus those that didn't -- that there was no division of the response there is irrespective of liver (inaudible). Fairooz, maybe you can add."", 'Fairooz Kabbinavar', ""Yeah. So Andy, just building up on what Mark has said in the Phase 1b/2 trial, we looked at multiple other factors trying to see were there any other features that would impact these responses that we're seeing in bev-naive patients. And to give you a very short answer, absolutely, no clinical feature appear to play a role in the significant robust responses that we've seen in the bev-naive patients. So we looked at laterality of the tumors, right and left tumors, both responded equally. We look at emissions with liver mets, not liver mets, they all seem to respond well. We looked at patients who had -- gender did not impact the outcome. So we think at this point, based on what we have seen in the Phase 1b/2 trial, and that if the bev-naive, if you will, that plays a significant role in the dramatic synergy that you're seeing between bev and onvansertib plus chemotherapy."", 'Andy Hsieh', ""I see. That's very helpful. So maybe moving out of the -- sorry, I asked it before, before we move on. So in terms of managing neutropenia for the ongoing 004 study, are you considering doing growth factor prophylaxis for patients?"", 'Mark Erlander', ""So it's the -- the three things that we normally would use, hold the dose or delay the next dose, allow the bone marrow to recover. And if it doesn't recover, then we use both factors according to ASCO guidelines. And then subsequently, I mean, we also have the option of doing dose reduction depending on which drug cause is the culprit. But again, we're back to 1b/2 trial and others. We have not found a reason for us to dose decrease. So we have all three options that will standard -- that we would normally use in managing these patients. But at this point, we don't think it's going to be a big issue."", 'Andy Hsieh', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then so outside of CRC, I believe small cell lung cancer in the September update was one [PR3] stable disease patients. Do you have any update on that cohort or that's the latest data?"", 'Mark Erlander', ""I can say that we don't have any update. The PI has moved to another academic institution, and so that has somewhat slowed down the accrual in that particular trial."", 'Andy Hsieh', 'I see. Great. Thank you so much for taking all of our questions and congratulations on the progress.', 'Mark Erlander', 'Thank you. Thank you, Andy.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to James Levine for closing remarks."", 'James Levine', 'Thank you, operator. This concludes our conference call and thanks again for joining us this afternoon. Bye-bye.', 'Operator', 'Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Both have sold well, but GSK’s has claimed about two-thirds of the U.S market.', 'Moderna aims to compete as well, and CDC advisers reviewed data from a Phase 3 trial of the company’s RSV shot. The results showed the vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1345, was initially 84% effective in preventing RSV-related disease with two or more symptoms in adults 60 years or older. That efficacy appears to wane somewhat over time, as updated data show a 63% efficacy rate over a longer time period.', 'Additionally, on Thursday, Pfizer released updated data on Abrysvo’s effectiveness, saying the shot was 78% effective through a second season in older adults. Pfizer’s disease definition was slightly different than Moderna’s however, measuring the vaccine’s prevention of disease with three or more symptoms.', 'Moderna has submitted its vaccine for Food and Drug Administration approval, which is set to decide by mid-May. If approved, ACIP could recommend its use in June, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote in a note to clients. But whether the ACIP recommends an annual or biennial vaccination routine “might present risk for use of [Moderna], as GSK has suggested higher durability,” Yee added.', 'CDC advisers also discussed Thursday the risk of severe adverse events to the current vaccines from GSK and Pfizer.', 'In particular, committee experts discussed Guillain-Barré syndrome, or GBS, an uncommon neurological condition that can cause muscle weakness and, in very rare instances, paralysis. In testing of their respective vaccines, GSK reported one case of GBS while Pfizer reported two.', 'Out of the roughly 9.6 million RSV vaccine doses administered to date, there were 23 verified cases of GBS reported to a federal adverse event database, 15 with Abrysvo and 8 with Arexvy. In most of those cases, however, recipients also received another vaccine, such as for influenza, which can complicate analysis of the side effect’s cause.', 'While CDC analysts found the data suggestive of a slight increase in GBS risk following RSV vaccination in older adults, they couldn’t confirm a link. They also noted that any possible risk must be put in the context of the vaccine’s benefit.', 'Amadea Bitton, a physician and ACIP panelist, said the benefits of vaccination against RSV still outweigh possible risks.', 'Advisers also discussed the timing of vaccination and judged that shots in the late summer or early fall ahead of the typical RSV season would have the largest benefit.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

In the year-ago quarter, the company had recorded earnings of $1.41 per share.Revenues came in at $14.25 billion, down 41% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis, reflecting an operational decline of 42%. Total revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.37 billion.The revenue decline, as expected, was due to a steep drop in revenues from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, on lower demand.With the end of the pandemic, sales of Pfizer’s COVID-19 products declined steeply. Sales of Prevnar family and Ibrance also declined in the quarter. However, sales of some key non-COVID products like Vyndaqel/Vyndamax and Eliquis alliance revenues, newly acquired products like Nurtec and new product launches like Abrysvo provided some top-line support. Revenues from Pfizer’s non-COVID products rose 8% operationally in the fourth quarter.International revenues declined 39% to $9.66 billion. U.S. revenues declined 46% to $4.59 billion.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses rose 1% (operationally) in the quarter to $4.47 billion primarily due to the timing of marketing and promotional activities. Adjusted R&D expenses declined 24% to $2.77 billion, driven primarily by lower spending across both vaccine programs and certain acquired assets, as well as lower compensation-related expenses.', 'Pfizer reports its revenues under three broad sub-segments of its Biopharma operating segment — Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology.

Comirnaty sales declined 57% in the United States due to lower contracted deliveries to the U.S. government following the commercial transition in September 2023. Comirnaty sales declined 53% outside U.S. markets due to lower demand and contracted deliveries. Comirnaty sales missed our estimate of $5.57 billion.Paxlovid revenues declined to negative $3.2 billion in the quarter due to a non-cash revenue reversal of $3.5 billion recorded in the fourth quarter for the return of an estimated 6.5 million unused EUA-labeled treatment courses from the U.S. government.Alliance revenues and direct sales from Eliquis rose 9% to $1.61 billion. Alliance revenues from Eliquis beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 billion as well as our model estimate of $1.49 billion.Global Prevnar family revenues declined 7% to $1.61 billion due to lower demand for pediatric patients in certain emerging markets and unfavorable timing of customer orders. The Prevnar family includes revenues from Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (pediatric and adult) and Prevnar 20 (adult and pediatric). Prevnar revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 billion as well as our model estimate of $1.76 billion.Prevnar sales declined 3% in the United States and 14% in international markets.Newly acquired product Nurtec ODT/Vydura contributed $282 million in the fourth quarter compared with $253 million in the previous quarter.Among the new products, Pfizer’s RSV vaccine, Abrysvo, recorded sales of $515 million in the fourth quarter compared with $375 million in the previous quarter. Abrysvo sales slightly beat our model estimate of $510 million.Specialty CareGlobal Vyndaqel family revenues of $961 million rose 39% year over year, driven by continued strong uptake of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy indication, primarily in the United States and developed Europe.

Enbrel revenues declined 12% to $203 million due to continued biosimilar competition in key European markets and Japan.New product, Oxbryta, generated sales of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $85 million in the previous quarter. Another new drug, Cibinqo, approved in 2022, recorded revenues of $37 million in the fourth quarter, the same as in the previous quarter.OncologyIn Oncology, Ibrance revenues declined 13% year over year to $1.19 billion. Lower demand trends globally due to competitive pressure and lower clinical trial purchases in certain international markets hurt sales growth.

You've got 8 million from YouTube TV. You've got another 4.6 million from Hulu. And you've got some others, including Dish. So this is relatively small. They have 1.6 million subscribers in the US and another 400,000. And they've lost but-- they've lost almost 2/3 of their market value in just the last two years, even though they've doubled their income in the last two years."", '- So what is the future then look like for a Fubo? Does it get acquired by someone else? Or what happens?', ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, at an enterprise value of roughly $700 million, it's going to be very valuable to somebody else. It's unlikely this company they keep losing money. Last year, they lost over $400 million in revenue."", ""So the other issue is that as much as they've started off marketing themselves as a sports service, they cost at $80 for their basic package. They cost just as much as you have in cable. And there's not a lot of difference between what you're going to get on FuboTV."", 'Now they have a great Latin package I can tell you that my kids have a lot more fun watching soccer in Spanish than a Latin package is only $32. But-- so it comes down to their position in the market, their financials, and then ultimately how much it costs for somebody to buy the service.', '- You talked about the struggles, though, in terms of the market cap for the company. To what extent is that related to that joint venture between ESPN, Fox, and WBD?', ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, it's been going in this direction. And there is a reason it's down to 8% for the day, which is that investors are very concerned. And the fact that the CEO of the company has had some very-- he's pulled no punches, a very choice words for-- we're talking about the partnership between Disney, Fox, and Warner Discovery."", ""And so-- but that-- even that partnership, it's expected that their package-- they haven't publicized anything but somewhere between $40 to $50 a month. And so yes, that's a threat to them. But a great deal more of the threat is they're not just competing against Disney and those three companies. They're competing against Comcast and Charter and other big operators."", ""- Let's sort of pull back even further, right, and just look at the streaming landscape overall because it feels confusing right now. It feels confusing for viewers. It feels confusing for investors in terms of all the offerings that are out there. And now they're doing the bundles. And so, you know, who do you think sort of comes out on top when all of that is said and done?"", ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, first of all, they all keep saying they were going to finally make money and cut their losses. And they really don't have a choice but to continue to produce. And so we've got Netflix is going to continue to produce programming. Amazon is huge in comparison. And yes, it starts off being confusing with the subscriber. How do you know what show is on what network or what streaming service?"", ""So we have a couple of streaming services that are really here to stay. And it's Netflix. And Disney does have a bundle of Hulu and ESPN+ and Disney+. What's fascinating is we're already seeing the rebundling of-- in the same way we had cable. So Verizon just announced a service where they'll give you both Max and Netflix for 10 bucks a month. So we're going to see the rebundling. Still all of our research shows that the average American home is going to subscribe to at least five services."", '- Really?', '- Wow.', ""MICHAEL WOLF: They'll churn them. And that, by the way, is on top of the free services like Tubi and Pluto that they're going to be using."", '- I mean, it sounds a lot like cable, right?', ""MICHAEL WOLF: It certainly does where-- and as soon as we get more live programming on these services-- and then what's next is news. And it's a pretty great substitute for cable.""]"

However, Antenna finds that almost 25% of those customers re-subscribe within 3 months.', 'Antenna Strategy Director Brendan Brady joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into the report, detailing the trends driving the cancelation and re-subscription churn.', 'Brady puts subscriber retention in perspective: ""If you take a cohort of consumers and you see how they sort of decay or cancel over time, it\'s not linear, right? It sort of decays very steeply and then flattens over time. The more months you\'re paying for the service, you\'re less likely to cancel. So that month zero to month three window is super fragile and important for these services to really win that customer. And what we found is that there\'s a high amount of subscriptions held in those early tenure periods. If you look at the nine biggest services, 39% of subscriptions that we measure are in their first year of tenure and if you remove Netflix (NFLX) from that calculation, it goes up to 45% so nearly half of subscriptions are in their first year of tenure and that\'s really when you\'re most at risk to cancel.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", 'AKIKO FUJITA: Well, it has been a choppy ride for the streaming industry, from cracking down on password sharing to additional price hikes, consumers wary of seeing their streaming bills rise are starting to push back.', ""More than 140 million subscribers canceled their streaming subscriptions last year. That's the most cancellations in five years. But roughly a quarter of customers resubscribe within three months of cancelling their subscription, according to an Antenna report."", ""For a deeper dive on the study, we are joined by Brendan Brady. He is Antenna strategy director. Brendan, this is a fascinating study. It answers many of the questions we've had about these streaming sites. So let's talk first about the cancellations that these sites saw."", ""How much of that is about customers becoming a little more cost conscious? How much of this is about just the sheer number of services that are out there, customers just can't keep up?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: I think it's the latter more than anything. there's. More choice than ever in terms of where you can access premium film and television content. There's also no switching costs associated with streaming. You can cancel a service in one, two, maybe three clicks."", ""And so we're seeing the consumer become more habituated to moving of in and out of these services. And that's been the primary driver of this increase in churn that we've seen as of late."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. We're talking about cancellations. But what your study also found that a lot of those customers do come back. So let's talk about the churn. How quickly is that churn happening right now? And who's most affected by it?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: So if we look at the consumer behavior around re-subscription, which is a core metric of ours here at Antenna, it's really on the rise, the behavior, overall, of canceling a service first, but then also adding it back."", ""And so if we look at the nine biggest streaming services in the US, 25% of customers are coming back within three months after canceling. Fast forward to 12 months, and it's about 40% of customers."", 'We see that Peacock and Netflix, actually, in this past year, saw the highest instance of winning back those customers at a quick rate. And I think a lot of it is driven by content. So maybe you subscribe to Peacock to watch ""Sunday Night Football,"" when the season kicks off. And then when the season ends, you might cancel, but you come back.', 'And we really see that the consumer is getting increasingly comfortable with moving in and out of these services with a lot more rigor.', ""AKIKO FUJITA: And Brendan, any sense on what some of those shows are or those offerings are that bring the consumers back, at least, brought them back, if you're looking at 2023 data?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: I think it's hard to say a specific title, just given that everyone has different tastes. But, overall, we certainly do see that the consumer will cancel, but then they'll also come back. And the implication there is that services now have to begin to manage these customers, not only over a single lifetime, but, really, think about their relationship with that platform more holistically."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: What's interesting to me, though, even though we're talking about re-subscriptions or re-subscribers, however you want to use the term, it is still also, for these brands or platforms, all about getting the new subscribers on board to, at least, lock them in to these services."", ""What did your study find about how that strategy is working? That three-month window you talk about to me is so fascinating, because have to wonder what the calculation is among those customers who've signed up to say, is this something that's worth keeping?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: So if you take a cohort of consumers, and you see how they decay or cancel over time, it's not linear. It decays very steeply. And then flattens over time. The more months that you're paying for the service, you're less likely to cancel."", ""And so that month zero to month three window is super fragile and important for these services to really win that customer. And what we've found is that there's a high amount of subscriptions held in those early tenure periods. If you look at the nine biggest services, 39% of subscriptions that we measure are in their first year of tenure."", ""And if you remove Netflix from that calculation, it goes up to 45%. So nearly half of subscriptions are in their first year of tenure. And that's really when you're most at risk to cancel. And so it's really important for these services to consider, who is that subscriber? What else are they paying for? What else are they watching? And really try to manage them so that they can get them past that fragile period and more towards the area of the survival curve, where things start to flatten out."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Brendan, what's the threshold for the average customer? Is it three platforms, three subscriptions, four subscriptions? What did you find?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: I can't give an absolute number. But if we look at it broadly, we see that the subscriptions per subscriber is consistently growing. At the same time, churn is increasing."", ""And so maybe you have three subscriptions in a given month. And the next month, you have two. or the next month, you have one. And maybe, the next month after that, you have five. We're in a world where there's virtually no switching costs associated with this, which is quite unlike cable, where you had to call someone, they would have to pick up your box, and so on."", 'And so we really see that the consumer is adding services strongly, but also canceling services with the same amount of strength.']"

That seems to be the case with Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). These companies have encountered issues over the past couple of years, leading to subpar financial results and underperforming stocks."", ""However, for patient investors willing to hold their shares for 10 years, Etsy and PayPal remain solid buys. Let's find out why."", ""The e-commerce industry is booming, and businesses are responding accordingly. There are plenty of platforms for online shopping, which makes it hard to carve out a successful and lucrative niche in this sector. Etsy has managed to do just that. It offers vintage, handmade, and unique goods that are difficult to find in other places. In a 2022 survey, 87% of Etsy's customers agreed: The platform has items they can't get elsewhere."", ""Etsy has developed a network effect that makes its platform increasingly valuable for buyers and sellers as its ecosystem grows. Still, the company hasn't been at its best recently. Vintage goods aren't known for being affordable. Economic issues have contributed to slowing sales growth for Etsy. In 2023, the company's revenue of $2.7 billion increased by just 7.1% year over year."", ""Though top-line growth has slowed, Etsy's number of buyers and sellers moved in the right direction. A strengthening ecosystem is vital for the company's future. Meanwhile, Etsy is taking steps to right the ship. The e-commerce specialist is aggressively spending on marketing. It is also improving its platform to make it easier for consumers to find what they want."", ""Etsy recently announced an artificial intelligence-powered feature to help shoppers find perfect gifts for their loved ones. The company is laser-focused on marketing its platform as a gift destination. This new feature is another step in that direction. We will know soon enough whether Etsy's initiatives are bearing fruit. And at any rate, the company's slump, which is partly due to economic conditions, won't last forever."", 'Etsy has long argued that it has barely scratched the surface of its total addressable market (TAM), which it estimates at $2 trillion in terms of gross merchandise volume (GMS), or the total dollar value of orders conducted on its platform. GMS in 2023 came in at $13.2 billion, a decrease of 1.2% year over year. Still, Etsy can deliver outsize returns over the next decade as it makes significant headway within its TAM.', ""PayPal recorded some of the most lucrative quarters in its history during the early days of the pandemic. Since then, revenue growth has slowed, active accounts growth has decelerated, and investor sentiment has shifted, leading to mediocre financial and stock market performances. However, it's important to look at the big picture."", ""PayPal has been a pioneer in the digital payment industry. The company's brand is famous, recognizable, and trustworthy. That's an important quality to have for a payment processor. PayPal also had 426 million active accounts as of the end of 2023, although that decreased by 2% year over year. It processed $1.5 trillion in total payment volume (TPV) last year, an increase of 13%. PayPal also benefits from a network effect: The more merchants that accept it as a payment method, the more attractive it is to consumers, and vice versa."", ""The company's entire suite of services also includes its peer-to-peer payment app, Venmo, as well as Braintree, which offers businesses payment processing solutions, fraud protection, data encryption, and more. Braintree is becoming increasingly important to PayPal's results. In 2023, the company's unbranded card processing segment -- comprised primarily of Braintree -- accounted for 35% of TPV, up from 30% in 2022 and the largest single category."", ""No other segment grew its TPV faster on a year-over-year basis. Maybe that's why PayPal hired Alex Chriss as its new CEO last year. Chriss, a former Intuit executive, has a track record of successfully leading the consumer-facing financial services division of his former employer. That doesn't guarantee PayPal's new CEO will help the company prosper, but it's also important to consider that the fintech industry still has a long runway for growth."", ""That, combined with PayPal's rock-solid position in the fintech space, network effects, and name recognition, makes it a top pick to profit from the increasing adoption of digital payment methods. So despite not being popular in the market over the past two years, PayPal remains an excellent buy-and-hold stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Etsy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Etsy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Etsy wasn’t one of them.

Tech giants like Apple also challenged smaller fintech companies by rolling out its own digital payment and lending platforms."", 'However, shrewd investors can still find some promising turnaround plays in this out-of-favor sector. Here are two fintech stocks that are worth buying -- and one that should be avoided at all costs, until and unless it gets its act together.', ""Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST) uses its artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to make loan-approval decisions for banks, credit unions, and auto dealerships. But instead of merely considering a would-be borrower's FICO score, credit history, and annual income, Upstart analyzes each applicant based on an array of non-traditional data points, including their education level, GPA, standardized test scores, and recent jobs."", ""That approach helped Upstart's clients make loans to a broader set of younger and lower-income customers, and the company grew like a weed when interest rates were historically low. Unfortunately, that growth slowed to a crawl as interest rates rose, its partners reined in their lending, and consumers took out fewer loans."", ""Upstart's revenue dropped 39% to $514 million in 2023, compared to a 1% decline in 2022 and 264% growth in 2021. For adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), it lost $17 million in 2023 -- after having delivered positive adjusted EBITDA in the previous two years."", ""The situation might seem dire, but analysts expect Upstart's revenue to rise 14% in 2024 to $585 million as interest rates stabilize. From 2024 to 2026, it's expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 26% as the macro environment improves. If that happens, investors could in retrospect see the stock as a bargain at its current valuation of 4 times next year's sales."", ""Affirm's (NASDAQ: AFRM) buy now, pay later (BNPL) platform lets consumers pay for purchases in installments without putting them on a credit card. That option also helps merchants reach a wider range of consumers while avoiding the swipe fees charged by the processors of traditional credit card purchases. During the pandemic, Affirm's growth was amplified by a surge in online sales, stimulus-induced spending, and a growing awareness of BNPL platforms among consumers as word of them across social media platforms."", 'But after the lockdown phase of the pandemic passed, Affirm struggled as inflationary headwinds sapped consumer discretionary spending, top customer Peloton experienced a major slowdown, and competition from other BNPL platforms intensified. Its delinquency rates also gradually rose, and rising interest rates cast a harsh light on its rising debt and persistent losses.', ""In its fiscal 2023 (ended June 30), Affirm's revenue only rose 18% to $1.59 billion, compared to 55% growth in its fiscal 2022 and 71% growth in fiscal 2021. That slowdown popped its bubbly valuations and crushed its stock, but analysts expect its revenue to rise 38% to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2024 and forecast a compound annual growth rate of 20% through fiscal 2026 as the macro environment stabilizes. That's a promising outlook for a company that trades at just 5 times next year's expected sales."", 'PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is still the 800-pound gorilla of the fintech market, but its growth has cooled during the past several years. The number of active accounts fell 2% to 426 million in 2023, and its annual transaction take rate dropped from 2.89% in 2015 to 1.76% in 2023. That slowdown was caused by its decoupling from its former owner eBay, stiff competition from other digital payments platforms, and the broader macro headwinds that crimped consumer spending.', 'PayPal grew rapidly early in the pandemic as people shifted toward online payments, but its revenue rose just 8% in both 2022 and 2023 -- compared to its 18% growth in 2021. Analysts expect its revenue to rise at an even slower compound annual rate of 7% from 2023 to 2026.', ""As PayPal struggles to gain new users, it's relying more heavily on its peer-to-peer payments app Venmo and its unbranded checkout service Braintree for revenue growth -- but both of those platforms dilute its earnings because they operate at lower margins than its main platform. That's why analysts expect its operating margin to narrow from 22% in 2023 to 19% in 2026."", 'All of those challenges make PayPal a tough stock to recommend, even if it looks historically cheap at 17 times forward earnings. That low valuation might limit its downside potential, but it will likely underperform compared to higher-growth fintech companies like Upstart or Affirm during the next few years as the macro environment warms up again.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Upstart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Upstart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Upstart wasn’t one of them.

So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$173. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 39% of Timothy Aydt's holding."", ""Insiders in Marathon Petroleum didn't buy any shares in the last year.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 82% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).', 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.', 'In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Molson Coors Beverage.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage ', ""Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing."", ""As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Molson Coors Beverage. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Molson Coors Beverage, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too."", 'Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Molson Coors Beverage is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.0% and 6.9% of the stock.', 'After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.', ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily."", 'The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', ""Our information suggests that Molson Coors Beverage Company insiders own under 1% of the company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$64m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. "", ""The general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders."", ""It seems that Private Companies own 4.1%, of the Molson Coors Beverage stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research."", 'While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with UAL.', ""United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL), with its latest SEC 10-K filing dated February 29, 2024, presents a detailed financial and operational overview of its performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. As a major U.S. network carrier, United Airlines operates a hub-and-spoke system with a significant focus on international and long-haul travel. The company's financial tables reveal a strategic emphasis on expanding its route network, enhancing customer loyalty programs, and investing in fleet modernization. With an aggregate market value of common stock held by non-affiliates at $17.9 billion as of June 30, 2023, United Airlines Holdings Inc demonstrates a strong market presence. The company's financials, coupled with its strategic initiatives, provide a foundation for a comprehensive SWOT analysis, which will be pivotal for investors and stakeholders in understanding the company's competitive positioning and future prospects."", ""Extensive Route Network and Hub System: United Airlines Holdings Inc's strength lies in its expansive route network, which is the most comprehensive among North American carriers. With hubs in key cities such as Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., United offers a wide range of domestic and international flights that cater to a diverse customer base. This strategic positioning allows the company to capture significant market share and provides a competitive edge in terms of connectivity and convenience for passengers."", ""Robust Loyalty Program and Strategic Alliances: Another pillar of United's strength is its MileagePlus loyalty program, which boasts a network of non-airline partners and a co-branded credit card agreement with Chase. In 2023, approximately 7.4 million MileagePlus flight awards were redeemed, accounting for 8.1% of United's total revenue passenger miles. The program's success in fostering customer loyalty is complemented by United's participation in the Star Alliance and various independent alliance agreements, which enhance its global reach and service offerings."", ""Intense Competition and Market Sensitivity: United Airlines Holdings Inc operates in a highly competitive industry where pricing and service offerings are critical. The company's financial performance is sensitive to competitive pressures, particularly from carriers with lower cost structures that can offer more attractive fares. This dynamic necessitates continuous innovation and cost management to maintain profitability and market share."", ""Fuel Cost Volatility: Fuel expenses are a significant concern for United, as they can dramatically impact operational costs and financial results. The company's SEC filing indicates that it does not engage in financial transactions to hedge against fuel price fluctuations, which exposes it to market volatility. In 2023, the price of aircraft fuel fluctuated substantially, highlighting the need for a more proactive approach to managing this critical expense."", 'Fleet Expansion and Modernization: United Airlines Holdings Inc has firm commitments to purchase aircraft from Boeing and Airbus, with deliveries scheduled through 2033. This fleet expansion and modernization strategy present an opportunity to enhance the customer experience, improve fuel efficiency, and expand service offerings. The introduction of new aircraft models can also position United as an industry leader in innovation and environmental sustainability.', ""Technological Advancements and Operational Excellence: United's focus on leveraging technology to drive operational efficiency and customer satisfaction presents significant opportunities. Investments in digital platforms, mobile applications, and alternative distribution systems can streamline the customer experience and reduce distribution costs. Additionally, the company's emphasis on operational excellence, particularly on-time flight performance, can improve customer loyalty and brand reputation."", ""Legal and Regulatory Challenges: United Airlines Holdings Inc is subject to various legal proceedings and regulatory challenges that can impact its operations and financial performance. The company's involvement in antitrust litigation and potential non-compliance with environmental regulations are examples of legal uncertainties that could result in financial penalties or operational restrictions."", ""Industry Dynamics and Economic Factors: The airline industry is influenced by global macroeconomic factors, including regional conflicts, changes in legal requirements, and shifts in consumer demand. United's operations are vulnerable to these external factors, which can cause fluctuations in financial results and necessitate adjustments to the company's strategic approach."", ""In conclusion, United Airlines Holdings Inc's SWOT analysis reveals a company with a strong foundation in its route network, loyalty program, and strategic alliances. However, it must navigate the challenges of intense competition, fuel cost volatility, and legal uncertainties. Opportunities for growth through fleet modernization and technological advancements are promising, but the company must remain vigilant against industry dynamics and economic factors that pose threats to its operational stability. Investors and stakeholders should consider these factors when assessing United's potential for long-term success."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

purchase and then use those points for cashback, whether it's on travel expenses or on something else."", ""We also suggest going for transferable points, something like Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, Capital One miles, where you can redeem them at a set rate for things like flights and hotels so you don't really have to do a ton of mental calculations in order to get some value."", ""Or you can transfer them to a variety of different airline and hotel partners that suit your need at a particular time, rather than having to stick to one program that might change its rules on a dime and leave you without enough miles for that trip you've been having your eye on for the last couple of months."", 'MADISON MILLS: All right.', ""Eric, one final question here for the users out there who have been utilizing credit card points, I'm wondering about the kind of transfer deals that come up from time to time."", 'What is the best way for folks to stay on top of those potential opportunities, and capitalize on them at the right times?', 'ERIC ROSEN: Definitely.', ""So when you're talking about are transfer bonuses, where instead of like one Amex point to one British Airways miles or one delta mile, for instance, you might get a 25% bonus."", ""So if you transfer 1,000 of them, you'll get 1,250 miles instead of the usual 1,000."", 'The best way to stay on top of those is to follow sites like ours, The Points Guy, because we have regular updates of what transfer bonuses are currently out there.', ""And I would say don't go speculatively transferring all of your points from those programs all at once because you should have a specific imminent redemption in mind where you can really take advantage of that extra value, rather than counting on something coming down the pike in a few months time."", ""Because like I said, programs can change, or that hotel that's in one category of award redemption today could go up the next day and then you've transferred all these points and you're not quite able to use them because you can't transfer them back to your other original account."", 'MADISON MILLS: All right, Eric.', 'We really appreciate it.', 'Thank you so much for that advice and have a great weekend.', 'Thank you.', 'ERIC ROSEN: Thank you.']"

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Should You Invest in RCL?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Royal Caribbean, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 10.2% over the past month to $9.88.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Royal Caribbean.

James, it is always good to see you. So you're pointing out, James, maybe our cruises actually could even get a bit pricier here in 2024. How come, James, and how much price pricier could we see?"", ""JAMES HARDIMAN: For sure. I mean, I think the pricing momentum, the trajectory of what we're seeing is exceedingly positive. As you mentioned, Norwegian had a really good fourth quarter. And the guidance for the first quarter, now, there are some easy comparisons in there."", ""But for pricing, that's up mid-teens year-over-year. That's a trajectory that we won't be able to sustain. But I think what's important to understand is if you think about that early pandemic and early post-pandemic period, where we saw inflation across the economy, the cruise industry was largely sitting that out, right? They were on the sidelines for a good amount of that time."", ""And so for a cruise space that's historically been what they would argue is an unfair discount to land-based vacations. They then sat that out. And so they found themselves at an even wider gap relative to land-based."", ""What we've seen over the last year, year and a half is a little bit of catch-up getting back to maybe 2019 levels. But they look at it and see significant pricing opportunity moving forward."", ""JULIE HYMAN: At the same time, James-- hey, Julie here. It's good to see you. At the same time, the cruise industry's message has been we are a better value than a land-based vacation, right? All in. And so how much room do they still have to raise prices and still sort of tout that value opportunity for travelers?"", ""JAMES HARDIMAN: Sure. Yeah, so historically, we've talked about this maybe call it 20% to 30% discount to comparable land-based. Coming out of the pandemic, that number was probably closer to 35 to 50 depending on what you're looking at. And we've seen that gap close a little bit."", ""But I think that leaves still on a like-for-like basis a meaningful opportunity. And that doesn't factor in-- what I would argue is some pretty good innovation in the cruise industry."", ""We've seen a number of these companies make big investments in land-based attractions, right? Private islands, resorts, water parks. And I think, those investments have allowed them to cater to a multigenerational vacation. And I think that is only going to drive pricing higher from here."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, James, I'm curious, you look at the stocks of these names. And they have enjoyed just these massive runs, James. I mean, investors clearly cheering them. They're moving in. Broadly, as you look across the market, the industry, James, any signs of softness that you would point out?"", 'JAMES HARDIMAN: No, I mean, I think, geographically, the Caribbean is clearly the strongest region in the world right now. Europe is strong. Not as strong.', 'As a global cruise company, you do have to deal with a whole lot of stuff, including the fallout from the unrest in the Middle East and the Red Sea restrictions that have now been placed.

But if you were to take that back to 2019, these stocks have at best held serve or at best flat with 2019 relative to a market that's up dramatically. And so depending on the time frame you look at, there's some pretty meaningful underperformance here."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Do you also think that when you look across the industry that they all have some degree of pricing power right now?', ""JAMES HARDIMAN: I do. It varies depending on which new hardware you're bringing to the market. What's your relative exposure is. And so there's certainly names that we like more than others. Having said that, again, relative to hotels, which may have stalled out here a little bit from a pricing perspective, yeah, I think the industry is strong."", 'JULIE HYMAN: James, good to see you.

For fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, the consensus mark of $1.62 per share suggests growth of 23.7% from the year-ago quarter's reported number.

In the trailing four quarters, it delivered an earnings beat of 7.8%, on average."", '\xa0', 'Ross Stores, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. Quote', ""Ross Stores has been benefiting from robust customer demand and recovery from supply-chain headwinds in the retail industry. Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to have benefited from broad-based growth across merchandise categories and regions. Gains at the core business, driven by consumers' continued focus on value and the company’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers, bode well.Positive customer response for its merchandise across both banners has been boosting the comps performance. Our model predicts comparable store sales to increase 1.5% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter and 3.1% for fiscal 2023, driven by strength across its namesake and dd's DISCOUNTS business formats.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, Ross Stores was optimistic about its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 performance. The company predicted comps to rise 1.2% year over year for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, whereas total sales are forecast to increase 8-10% year over year.Additionally, the company’s results are expected to reflect the continued benefits of higher merchandise margin, lower distribution expenses, domestic freight and occupancy expenses. This is likely to have boosted its margins and the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.We estimate the operating margin to expand 70 bps to 11.4% in the to-be-reported quarter and 40 bps to 11% for fiscal 2023. On a dollar basis, operating profit is expected to increase 16.5% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter and 11.3% for fiscal 2023.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected an operating margin of 11.3-11.5% for the fiscal fourth quarter, driven by gains from higher merchandise margins, owing to lower ocean freight costs and a 65-bps gain from the 53rd week. However, the company estimates these gains to be moderate from improvements in the prior periods of this year.The operating margin for the fiscal fourth quarter is also likely to benefit from lower domestic freight and distribution costs partly due to favorable packaway timing. The gains are expected to be partly offset by higher incentive compensation.The company envisions the bottom line to be $1.56-$1.62 per share for the fourth quarter and $5.30-$5.36 for fiscal 2023.Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans, which are likely to have aided the top line. The company's store-expansion efforts have been focused on continually increasing penetration in existing and new markets. The fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 performance is anticipated to have gained from ROST’s return to normal store opening targets. Gains from new stores are expected to get reflected in ROST’s sales for the fiscal fourth quarter.However, Ross Stores has been witnessing higher costs due to the ongoing headwinds related to the ongoing macroeconomic volatility, rising inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. The company has been witnessing rising incentive costs, which are likely to have led to increased SG&A expenses in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.Our model predicts the cost of goods sold to increase 7.5% year over year to $4.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter and 5% to $14.6 billion for fiscal 2023. As a percentage of sales, we expect SG&A expenses to increase 90 basis points to 14% in the fiscal fourth quarter and 120 bps to 16% for fiscal 2023. In dollar terms, SG&A expenses are expected to rise 17% year over year for the fiscal fourth quarter and 16.6% for fiscal 2023."", 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ross Stores this time around.

In choosing Richardson Wealth after interviewing 50 industry professionals, he said ""with the significant investments Richardson Wealth made to dramatically scale the business now in place, I am drawn to the firm\'s advisor-centric culture, the rich history of the name on the door, and the vision to become the brand of choice for Canada\'s top advisors and their clients.""

In 2023, we generated free cash flow available for growth of $35.4 million. Free cash flow improved from 2022 but was still negative $2.6 million. It was negative primarily because of $18.8 million of recruiting payments and transformation related costs, including payments to resolve legacy legal matters.

American Express shares, meanwhile, have increased in value by nearly 6,000% since 1977, the year of its IPO."", 'Both companies operate high-quality businesses with proven long-term track records. But which stock is a better buy right now?', ""One of the most powerful advantages a company can have is the magic of network effects. What exactly is a network effect? In a nutshell, it's a characteristic that allows a company to grow stronger the larger it gets."", ""Visa and American Express are perfect examples. If only a few people used Visa or American Express credit cards, most merchants wouldn't accept them. Why build out a particular payment system for only a few customers? Conversely, if only a few merchants accepted Visa or American Express, most people wouldn't be interested in using that form of payment, for it wouldn't work at most locations."", 'It can be difficult to avoid this chicken-or-the-egg problem. But when a company cracks the code, the magic of network effects is unleashed.', 'As more people become Visa or American Express users, more merchants begin accepting that form of payment. A greater number of merchants accepting Visa or American Express attracts more users, which in turn attracts yet more merchants. It is a positive feedback loop that can persist for decades.', ""In many ways, American Express and Visa are still riding the wave of network effects. There's a reason just four companies dominate nearly 100% of the U.S. credit card market. Visa commands the largest market share at 49.5%, with American Express coming in last at around 7.4% . (Mastercard and Discover are in second and third place, respectively.)"", 'It will be incredibly difficult for other players to enter this consolidated market due to the difficulty of achieving long-term network effects. Companies like Visa and American Express, meanwhile, can continue to benefit from their incumbent market power and brand recognition.', 'Put simply, network effects are a growth driver that can propel a stock for decades. Both Visa and American Express have cracked the code.', 'If network effects were responsible for the long-term growth of both companies, then it follows that the company with stronger network effects will produce superior results in the years to come. With more than 7 times the number of cards in circulation, Visa has a strong lead in this department.', ""Visa's superior network effects are partially evident in the company's return on equity -- a measure of how much net income flows to shareholders. After years of improvement, Visa's return on equity is around 46%, roughly 1.5 times higher than American Express."", 'Even more impressive, Visa was able to post these superior return figures while employing less debt than American Express. Often, companies are able to boost returns on equity by leveraging the balance sheet and taking on debt. By improving its return profile without a sizable increase in debt, Visa has proven that it can scale its business more efficiently than the competition.', ""On paper, Visa appears to be the better business. It has a higher return on equity, lower debt levels, greater market share, and arguably superior network effects. But there is another aspect to consider: each stock's valuation. It is possible, after all, to overpay for a great business. Even if American Express is less efficient as a business, a cheap stock price could make it the more attractive option."", 'Which stock is cheaper today? Without a doubt, the answer is American Express.', ""Right now, American Express stock trades at a free cash flow yield of 10.5%. That means a $100 investment would lay claim to around $10.50 in free cash flow. Visa, for comparison, trades at a free cash flow yield of just 3.3%. That's only $3.30 in free cash flow per $100 invested."", 'On an earnings basis, the situation remains unchanged. American Express trades at an earnings yield of 5.1%, whereas Visa stock trades at a yield of only 3.1%.', 'Both Visa and American Express make sense as long-term investments. Visa can likely better defend its market share and grow more efficiently than American Express. However, American Express stock is clearly the better bargain.', ""Which stock should you buy? The answer, surprisingly, is both. By diversifying your investment, you don't have to pick one winner over the other. Both operate high-quality businesses with strong economic moats. Visa has the advantage of size, while American Express has the advantage of being a better value."", 'So when faced with the dilemma of choosing between two quality businesses, the answer is often to buy both.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

In the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024, Visa showed substantial growth in its GAAP net income and EPS due to the rise in payment volumes and cross-border transactions. Visa's fast expansion through acquisitions and partnerships, as well as its utilization of fintech innovations such as tap-to-pay technologies, is another element that supports its position as the top payment company. The DCF valuation suggests that Visa stock is fairly valued as it accounts for prospective growth and operational efficiencies. Nevertheless, the assessment is cautious due to possible counterbalance from competitive forces, regulatory changes, and global economic factors, which may affect future profitability. Despite these challenges, Visa is a promising investment opportunity to consider, given that the stock price represents its strong financial performance and expectations for future growth."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with BKNG.', ""Visa's first quarter of fiscal 2024 showed a solid financial performance, with the GAAP net income jumping to $4.9 billion, up 17%, and EPS increasing by 20% to $2.39 compared to the previous year. The growth was supported by the combination of net earnings from equity investments and the operations of costs related to transactions, even in the constant background of litigation costs in the comparison year. The company saw the net revenue rise by 9% to 8.6 billion dollars, mainly driven by the increased payment volumes, cross-border transactions, and processed transactions, which demonstrates Visa's remarkable presence in the digital payment ecosystem."", 'Source: Investor slides', ""It is to be noted that the non-intra-Europe cross-border volume increased by 16%, which illustrates VISA's global solid position. Operational efficiencies caused a 6% essential decline in operating expenses under GAAP line items, mainly due to lesser litigation provisions. Equally, the data processing and other revenues increased by 14 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Visa's strategic focus on expanding its digital payment infrastructure and fostering partnerships coupled with successful cost management has strengthened its financial health, which has earned the firm leadership in the global payments industry."", ""The prospects of growth and investment for Visa are based on solid Q1 2024 performance, strategic expansions, and its fintech innovations. The Company reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations with an 8.9% increase in net revenues to $8.6 billion powered by 8% growth in the payment volume and an impressive 16% surge in the cross-border volume. Visa's acquisitions like Pismo and Prosa, coupled with strategic partnerships with major financial institutions globally, clearly indicate its focus on further strengthening its digital payment capabilities and markets. Through its adoption of fintech innovations such as tap-to-pay technologies and strategic collaborations with fintech giants, Visa's involvement in the fintech space clearly demonstrates its flexibility and scalability in providing digital payment solutions."", ""Visa is financially strong, with good operating margins and effective dividend and share repurchase strategies that show its ability to produce positive shareholder returns. Analyst estimates compiled for 2024 show a continuation of revenue and earnings per share (EPS) growth, which firmly confirms Visa to be a leader in the payment processing sector. The company's strategic investments, market expansion initiatives, and fintech innovations make it well-placed for continued growth, meaning Visa stock has become an attractive investing opportunity. Its capability to stay dynamic in the ever-changing payment system hints at a favorable future, consolidating its position as a good investment option and reason for having an attractive return."", 'The DCF valuation from ""Alphaspread"" shows Visa\'s financial prospects are depicted with robust optimism. The graph shows an upward trend of operating income within the next five years, a valuable signal of Visa\'s potential for earnings growth. The operating margin is projected to escalate to 66%, indicative of increasing operational efficiency and profitability. The model further reveals an expected increase in revenues from $43.3 billion to $62.6 billion, which translates to a notable growth rate over the forecast period.', 'Source: Alphaspread valuation', 'With the increasing NOPAT numbers, it is evident that the profitability of Visa, net of taxes, is on an upward trend. This denotes that the company is increasing its profits and effectively handling its tax liabilities. The impressive NOPAT growth validates robust financial health and solid operational performance and gives investors confidence in Visa.', ""The FCFF's year-over-year increase is the most important sign. It indicates that at least the amount of funds generated from operations is estimated to be more, which could be paid out as dividends to the shareholders, repurchased by the company, reduced debt, or invested back in growth initiatives. This is the most essential function of the model because it makes the value of the company and that of the stock in the future."", ""From the perspective of the present value of the cash flows to be expected in the future, which are discounted at a rate of 8.22%, the company has a moderate risk level. The discount rate, symbolic of Visa's strong position and assured cash installments, determines the present recognized value of future income. The numbers indicate that Visa's current stock is at the correct expected cash flow value."", 'Source: Alphaspread valuation', 'The terminal value, a significant component of the DCF, is based on a growth rate of about 2.95%, thus implying that the market believes that Visa will continuously grow beyond the immediate forecasting period. The slowing down of growth, according to rapidly maturing business, is still an essential component of the result; it shows that the company is not concerned about the need to be more concerned with the growth phase.', 'Therefore, according to the DCF model, Visa shares are priced at current levels that almost correspond to their fair value if current growth assumptions hold. The model signifies the company with a solid financial position and a forecast of growth associated with heavy demand, which is, in turn, only transient. It can dissuade some value investors even if the stock does not present a good discount or create a sufficient margin of safety. On the contrary, for growth-oriented investors who think that Visa can beat these estimates, the stock could still be an attractive investment opportunity. The model depicts Visa as a financially healthy firm, but its stock price incorporates its outstanding business fundamentals and upside potential.', ""Investing in Visa stock, while promising due to the company's solid market position and financial health, carries certain risks. The stock's current valuation suggests it is reasonably priced, leaving little room for error in growth projections. Any slowdown in consumer spending or disruptions in cross-border transactions could adversely affect Visa's transaction volumes and, consequently, its revenue. Additionally, the evolving landscape of digital payments poses a competitive risk, with fintech innovations and new payment platforms potentially encroaching on Visa's market share. Regulatory challenges and changes in interchange fee structures in various jurisdictions could also impact profitability. Lastly, the global economic environment could affect transaction volumes and cross-border payment profitability, including interest rate changes and currency fluctuations. These factors collectively represent a risk profile that potential investors must weigh against the company's growth prospects and operational strengths."", ""Visa's robust earnings growth, strategic acquisitions, and fintech innovations suggest a bullish future, yet the stock price already reflects these strengths, indicating it's fairly valued. For investors, Visa offers stability and consistent performance without the discount typically sought by value investors, making it an attractive proposition primarily for those banking on its continuous market dominance and innovation to drive returns."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

The reason for this is that Buffett's investment strategy is simple and can be duplicated by anyone. He typically seeks out brand-name businesses that offer sustainable competitive advantages and are guided by rock-solid management teams."", 'Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" as Buffett has come to be known, has overseen a greater-than-5,000,000% aggregate return in his company\'s Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on February 23.', ""The interesting thing about the 45 stock, $371 billion investment portfolio Buffett and his team oversee at Berkshire is that plain-as-day values can still be found -- even with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 claiming new record highs. The following three Warren Buffett stocks are all screaming buys in March, and they're fully capable of delivering for shareholders for years to come."", ""The first Warren Buffett stock that's begging to be bought by opportunistic long-term-minded investors as we barrel into March is none other than world-leading payment facilitator Visa (NYSE: V)."", 'The biggest concern for Visa shareholders is that financial stocks are cyclical. This is to say that they ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. and global economy.', ""If the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, the expectation would be for consumer and enterprise spending to decline. That's not good news for a company like Visa that relies on growth in spending and aggregate transactions to drive its sales and profits higher."", ""However, the difference between recessions and periods of growth for the U.S. economy is night and day. Even though recessions are a perfectly normal and unavoidable aspect of the economic cycle, they don't stick around for very long. Out of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II in September 1945, nine failed to reach the one-year mark and none of the remaining three surpassed 18 months."", 'Comparatively, most periods of expansion last multiple years, with two surpassing the 10-year mark since World War II. Patience has been a moneymaking trait for investors in payment processors like Visa.', 'Something else to consider is just how vast the growth runway is that sits in front of Visa. Despite dominating credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., Visa has hardly scratched the surface in underbanked regions like the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. The company has more-than-enough capital to organically expand its payment infrastructure or can make the occasional acquisition to rapidly broaden its reach.', ""As I've pointed out numerous times before, Visa's avoidance of lending is another reason it's such a successful business. Though I don't doubt Visa could make a seamless transition to lending, becoming a lender would expose the company to loan losses and credit delinquencies during recessions."", ""Since it's strictly focused on payment facilitation, Visa doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses. Not being financially constrained during periods of weakness and uncertainty helps Visa bounce back more quickly than other financial stocks from downturns, as well as keeps its profit margin north of 50%."", ""Lastly, the valuation remains enticing. Visa's forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 25 is 13% lower than its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period."", 'A second Warren Buffett stock that represents a screaming buy in March and likely well beyond is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI).', 'For radio operators, the health of the advertising market is often what takes precedence. If the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, the expectation would be for businesses to pare down their ad spending. With quite a few money-based metrics and predictive indicators suggesting a downturn in the U.S. economy in 2024, it could be a challenging year for radio operators.', ""However, Sirius XM isn't a run-of-the-mill radio company. It brings three distinct competitive advantages to the table."", ""To start with, it's the only licensed satellite-radio operator. While it still competes for listeners with terrestrial and online-radio operators, being the only licensed satellite-radio operator provides the company with phenomenal subscription pricing power."", ""Secondly, Sirius XM's revenue breakdown is markedly different than terrestrial and online radio providers. Whereas the latter are heavily reliant on advertising revenue to keep the lights on, Sirius XM generates only 20% of its revenue from advertising. Approximately 77% of Sirius XM's sales derive from subscriptions."", 'Subscribers are far less likely to cancel their service than advertisers are to pull back their spending. This should allow Sirius XM to navigate inevitable downturns in the economy better than its peers.', 'The third competitive edge is that some aspects of its cost structure are highly predictable. While royalty and talent acquisition costs will vary from one quarter to the next, transmission and equipment costs are relatively fixed. Sirius XM can continue to add subscribers and not owe any extra expenses from these line items.', ""The icing on the cake is that Sirius XM stock is historically cheap. Shares can be purchased right now for around 14 times Wall Street's consensus earnings per share (EPS) for the company in 2025. That's a 27% discount to Sirius XM's forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year span."", ""The third Warren Buffett stock that's a screaming buy in March and well beyond is e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)."", ""Not to sound like a broken record, but the clearest headwind for all three companies I'm highlighting is a U.S. recession. Most people are familiar with Amazon because it operates the world's top online marketplace. In 2023, Amazon brought in roughly $0.38 of every $1 that was spent in U.S. online retail sales. If the U.S. economy weakens, there's a pretty good chance we'd see e-commerce sales slow down or shift into reverse."", ""But what's critical for investors to note is that e-commerce accounts for very little of the operating income and cash flow Amazon generates. The lion's share of Amazon's profits and cash flow are derived from an assortment of ancillary segments -- and these segments are still firing on all cylinders."", 'Nothing is more important to Amazon than its cloud infrastructure segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). As of the end of September, AWS had gobbled up close to a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service share, based on estimates from tech-analysis firm Canalys.', ""With enterprise cloud spending still in its relatively early stages, AWS shouldn't have any trouble sustaining a double-digit growth rate through the remainder of the decade. Even though AWS accounts for a sixth of Amazon's net sales, it's often responsible for between 50% and 100% of the company's operating income."", ""Advertising services and subscription services are no slouches, either. Amazon is one of the most-visited sites on a monthly basis, with well over 2 billion unique visitors, which assists with its ad-pricing power. Likewise, it's signed up in excess of 200 million people worldwide to a Prime subscription."", ""Even if the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, it's unlikely that Amazon's operating cash flow would suffer much, if at all. It's this robust growth in the company's cash flow that allows Amazon to aggressively reinvest in its ever-growing logistics network, as well as higher-growth initiatives, like artificial intelligence (AI)."", ""To round things out, Amazon remains inexpensive. Over the trailing-five-year period, Amazon has commanded a multiple of nearly 23 times its cash flow. However, opportunistic investors can scoop up shares of this industry leader right now for less than 13 times Wall Street's forecast cash flow for the company in 2025."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

With consumer debt on the rise, is now a good time to buy the stock? Let's find out."", 'Visa has an incredible competitive advantage as the largest payment network operator in the world. The company has had more than six decades to build up its merchant and customer base, giving it strong network effects.', 'It has gained the trust of its banking partners, and as its network expands, Visa can use those funds to reinvest in different payment verticals, scale up, improve security, and attract more business.', 'In 2022, the company processed $14.1 trillion in total transaction volume, well ahead of its next closest competitor, Mastercard, which processed $8.2 trillion. Smaller competitors like American Express and Discover processed $1.5 trillion and $258 billion in volume, respectively.', 'Visa earns fees every time it processes payments for merchants, with an average credit card processing fee of about 1% to 3%, with a portion of these fees going to its partner banks. The company also earns fees for data processing, authorization, clearing, and settlement services.', 'After accounting for client incentives of $12.3 billion (amounts paid to financial-institution clients for using its cards), Visa earned $32.7 billion in net revenue during its 2023 fiscal year ended Sept. 30.', 'What makes Visa a compelling long-term investment opportunity is its growth potential. Management says its network can support an additional $185 trillion in new volume with its account-based payments platform, Visa Direct, and its commercial cross-border platform, Visa B2B Connect. The company has over 500 partners using Visa Direct, including some huge payment companies like Stripe, Fiserv, and Adyen.', ""All of this gives it a powerful network and competitive advantage -- evident in Visa's profit margins. During the past decade, margins have averaged an impressive 47%. Meanwhile, last year's free cash flow was just over $19 billion, providing plenty of cash flow to invest in its products, pay dividends, and buy back its shares."", 'Visa investors want to keep an eye on a couple of things. One is the growing consumer debt balances. Credit card debt in the U.S. is now $1.13 trillion. These growing balances, alongside the historically high interest rates on credit cards, could potentially weigh on consumer spending.', ""The good news for investors is that Visa doesn't have credit risk. The company doesn't hold credit card loans on its books. Instead, it partners with banks for its branded cards and earns fees while the partner banks hold on to loans and service that debt. So, while an uptick in defaults could weigh on consumer spending, Visa doesn't have to worry about credit risk and could ride out a recession better than some of its peers."", 'Another thing to watch for is growing competition and possible regulations that could affect the strength of its payment network. Regulators have put Visa and Mastercard in their sights, arguing that the companies have a duopoly on the payments market that should be broken up with more competition.', ""Those regulators have proposed the Credit Card Competition Act, which would require banks with more than $100 billion in assets to process electronic credit transactions on at least two networks, with one being other than Visa or Mastercard. As of Feb. 28, the Credit Card Competition Act hasn't passed Congress. However, this legislation is worth keeping tabs on for investors because it could put a dent in Visa's earnings."", 'Although the stock is near an all-time high, it trades at a reasonable valuation at 32.5 times earnings (P/E ratio) and 28.5 times forward earnings, both of which are slightly below its 10-year average P/E of 33.8.', 'Visa has achieved excellent growth and has a solid competitive advantage in the payments market.

This is a five-year initiative that sets out to promote digital financial inclusion for roughly 20 million people, including small holder farmers (SHF) and nano, micro and small enterprise (NMSE) owners. This move bodes well for Visa as financial inclusion and greater adoption of digital payments should buoy its results.', 'This initiative is targeting individuals, including women from low and middle-income countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa. While greater access to mobiles has promoted a rise in digital payments, there remains a gender gap in phone ownership and Internet use. Per The Global Findex Database 2021 report, digital payments have risen by 66% from 2014 in low and middle-income countries. There is a 20% less probability for women in these countries to hold a financial account. SHFs also have limited to no access to formal financial services like loans, savings and credit.', 'DFA will provide financial education resources through a mobile financial literacy toolkit, enabling greater participation and access to mobile money services. This initiative will translate to a higher number of individuals under the ambit of the digital economy, thereby enhancing Visa’s top line in the future. Countries like Africa are a large market for mobile money services, and Visa is seen partnering with local players to get a slice of the rapid digital transformation in those markets. Visa’s Visa Direct solution aims to allow users to receive or send money from any mobile money account or Visa card across the world. This will increase the volume of transactions in Visa’s network and boost its presence in the untapped markets.', 'DFA will also work with the Visa Economic Empowerment Institute and GSMA Foundation to develop joint research on advocacy, financial inclusion and product innovation for SHFs, NMSEs, women and globally displaced individuals.

The company's Computer & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+29.8% vs. +25.2%). The company's strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving its revenues. It expects net revenues to increase in the low double digits for fiscal 2024.Visa, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing bottom-line growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.The company beat earnings estimates by 3.4% in the fiscal first quarter of 2024. However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia-Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)Amgen's shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+24.3% vs. -4.5%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in the future quarters.The addition of Horizon Therapeutics has given Amgen a significant rare disease business. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several data readouts are expected in the next 12 months.However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimates have gone up ahead of Q4 earnings release.

Investing $10,000 in each of these five ultra-high-yield dividend stocks could make you nearly $4,000 in annual passive income.', 'Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) is the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC). It focuses primarily on providing financing alternatives to the upper end of the middle market. The BDC industry has grown significantly because many banks have shied away from these opportunities.', 'As a BDC, Ares Capital must return at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. With its dividend currently yielding 9.5%, investing $10,000 in the stock would generate $950 in annual passive income.', 'You should be able to count on this dividend income. Ares Capital continues to generate solid profits and has paid stable or increasing dividends every quarter for 14 consecutive years.', 'Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) is a large midstream energy company that operates pipelines, storage facilities, and more. It has grown both organically and through acquisitions, most recently closing on the buyout of Crestwood Equity Partners in November 2023.', ""The company's distribution yield stands at 8.6%.

Here's why I believe they're great ones to buy to help support what I hope will be a comfortable retirement."", 'Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a knack for growing shareholder value. It has delivered a 13.9% compound annual total return since its public market listing in 1994. ', 'Two factors have helped drive its ability to create value for investors. Realty Income has grown its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) at a 5% compound annual rate since going public. ', ""The company's stable and growing cash flow has allowed it to pay an attractive and steadily rising monthly dividend. The REIT currently yields 5.9% due to the nearly 20% decline in its share price over the last year. It has increased its payment 123 times since 1994, growing the payout at a 4.3% annual rate. "", 'Realty Income can continue growing shareholder value by increasing its adjusted FFO per share and high-yielding dividend. The REIT is aiming to raise its adjusted FFO by 4% to 5% per share over the long term by expanding its portfolio of durable income-producing properties. That should enable it to continue increasing its high-yielding dividend. ', ""Add the two up, and it should be able to deliver a 10%-plus average annual total return. That's a strong return for a lower-risk, retirement-focused investment. "", ""Starbucks has also traded down over the past year (by about 8%). Because of that, it has a cheaper valuation. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has fallen from the high 20s to the low 20s, and its dividend yield has risen to 2.4%. That's a compelling value proposition for a strong and growing company. "", 'Despite already being the largest coffee chain in the world, Starbucks has a lot of growth ahead. The company plans to expand to 35,000 stores outside of North America by 2030, a roughly 60% increase from its current international footprint (and a more than 40% overall increase). The company also expects to continue expanding its U.S. store footprint while growing its same-store sales and margins. ', ""These drivers should grow same-store revenue by more than 5% annually over the long term while total sales rise at more than 10% per year. Meanwhile, the company's expanding margins should support 15%-plus annual growth in earnings per share (EPS)."", "" Earnings growth should enable Starbucks to continue increasing its dividend at a healthy pace. Given that robust growth, even if the valuation multiple continues contracting, it could still produce total annualized returns in the mid-teens from here. That's an excellent return from such a high-quality company. "", 'Verizon is a cash flow machine. The telecom produced $37.5 billion in cash flow from operations last year and $18.7 billion in free cash after funding capital expenses. That gives it the money to pay its dividend ($11 billion) with room to spare. ', 'The company currently offers a bond-like income stream, given its massive yield of 6.7%. However, unlike a fixed-income investment, Verizon steadily increases its payment. The company raised its dividend by around 2% last year, its 17th straight year of dividend growth. That should continue, providing investors with a strong and growing base return. ', ""Verizon's already robust cash flows should rise in the future. It has invested heavily to grow its 5G network, which should increase revenue and operating cash flow. "", 'Meanwhile, spending should come down (with lower operating and capital expenses), which should boost its free cash flow. That will give the company the growing free cash flow to continue increasing its dividend and repay debt, further strengthening its investment-grade balance sheet.', "" Falling debt will improve cash flow by reducing interest expenses while transferring value from creditors to shareholders. These factors should drive stock appreciation over the long term, enabling Verizon to generate solid total returns that could approach the double digits. That's a good return for such a low-risk, income-focused stock. "", ""Realty Income, Starbucks, and Verizon are great stocks to invest in with retirement in mind. They have lower risk profiles and should produce solid total returns over the coming years.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam."", ""Adam Singolda: Thanks, Jessica. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. And before we talk about the business, I want to start with a word about our people. I've always said that a company's true innovation is its culture and people. And I'm so proud of the tremendous resilience displayed by our nearly 2,000 Taboolars during the war in Israel. Their resilience is what's driving our progress in reaching new users, delivering engaging experiences in the open web, improving our effectiveness at monetization and driving yield. We have real momentum coming into this year, and it shows in our Q4 results and strong 2024 financial guidance. Turning first to our quarterly results, we had a strong end to 2023; Q4 ex-TAC of $168.5 million, growing 6% versus 2023 Q4."", ""Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $50.1 million, a significant beat to the high end of our guidance by $18 million, representing over 30% adjusted EBITDA margin. Free cash flow in Q4 was $10.5 million, bringing our 2023 free cash flow to $52.2 million, representing 3x growth over 2022, as well as 50% conversion to EBITDA, which is our desired stated goal. 2024 is set to be a record year for Taboola across all key measures, revenue, ex-TAC gross profit, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. On the revenue front, we're back to fast growth. Revenue is growing 33% to nearly $2 billion this year. Ex-TAC is growing 25% to $670 million. We are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA guidance of over $200 million, which is 2x 2023. And we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance of over $100 million, also nearly 2x of 2023."", ""On the business front, there is a lot of good momentum. 2024 is benefiting from fast adoption of our AI offerings, and we assume yield expansion this year after two years of softness. Yahoo is ramping up, already crossing the $100 million mark in Q1, with the great trust and collaboration between our teams. Now, and since we've signed the partnership with Yahoo, many investors have asked us what is next, what will be the next Yahoo-style partnership? And I'm very, very happy to share than another iconic consumer brand has just chosen Taboola as its partner of choice to help them grow their advertising business. I hope to share more about this very soon. On the back of our business momentum, strong balance sheet, and commitment to shareholder returns, we're announcing a new share buyback authorization of $100 million, which represents approximately 6% of our current market cap."", ""2023 was going to be an investment year for growth. We're investing more than $100 million a year in R&D and AI to bring users and advertisers the same amazing experience they have when they interact with search and social platforms. Every day, we're getting closer to the size of X, Pinterest, Snap, and others in revenue and ad spend. And we're paving our way to becoming the very first must-buy platform for the open web. As I reflect on our journey, 10 years ago, we generated just over $200 million in revenue. I remember it like it was yesterday. And this year, 10 years later, we're approaching $2 billion. Now, looking ahead, I see two key themes that will allow us to achieve our financial transformation in 2024. The first one is reaching and engaging users in the open web."", ""With the addition of Yahoo, and now another iconic consumer brand, there's a lot of momentum here. The second one is how well we can monetize our time with consumers, specifically growth in performance advertising and AI to drive yield. Now, let's expand into both of these areas. Starting with how we reach users on the open web. We're seeing great momentum of publishers choosing Taboola on the back of our technology investments. We're so much more than just to publishers as we empower the entire publish organization, the editorial team, subscription team, audience team, monetization team, and more. Publisher win rates continue to improve with terrific new publisher partners joining Taboola family from all around the globe, including A360 Media, Postmedia, Times Internet, Nine Entertainment, and more."", ""We renewed and expanded our scope with existing publishers, including NBC News, McClatchy, Editora Globo, Prisa, Ynet, and more. In the industry, we're seeing a shift of great consumer companies getting into advertising in a bigger way. This includes Disney, Amazon, Netflix, DoorDash, Uber, Walmart, and more, where to some, advertising is already one of the most profitable lines of business they have. I expect that Fortune 500 CEOs will increasingly be asked to present their advertising strategy. And that the advertising industry will get to become a $1 trillion market in years to come. This is just the beginning. Now, while I believe many of these companies would try to sell directly to big brands, many would consider partnering with a technology company like Taboola to reach tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of mid-funnel performance advertisers."", ""We have an opportunity to become the advertising engine of choice to the open web. We call it advertising in a box. Signing strategic partnerships with publishers and big consumer platforms give Taboola another way to reach users, and access new premium advertisers. And we've seen it already with Yahoo, as incredible brands are starting to spend. And these are the best of the best out there, names like Samsung, and Verizon, Hulu, Hilton Hotels, Southwest Airlines, Citibank, and many others. On the Yahoo front, I can tell you we just had an executive offside for the Yahoo leadership, and we're focused on executing our plans this year, and into 2025. our biggest priority is demand migration of Yahoo omnichannel advertisers. I'm happy to tell you we're seeing good results."", ""And we recently shared the case study of large advertisers seeing 3x in leads volume at 24% lower cost. To share some of Yahoo's good progress, we expect Q1 revenue to cross the $100 million in revenue, which is fast ramping. Beyond working with publishers, we also reach users as part of Taboola News as we bring our publishers' content to Android devices. Taboola News had a spectacular year in 2023, with revenue growing to over $100 million. It is still in early stages, with a lot of work ahead of us, yet we expect another strong year for Taboola News in 2024. This is because device manufacturers all around the world continue to seek differentiated offerings that delight users with personalized experiences. Beyond publishers and Taboola News, we're also reaching users with our Header Bidder."", ""We're continuing to take advantage of our direct demand, unique data, and AI to bid on inventory that is not exclusively ours. Microsoft continues to be our largest Bidder partner, and we expect to expand our scope across a network of publishers in 2024. Microsoft made some changes to its Epic platform in Q4 that impacted all Epic partners they work with, including us. This had a single-digit millions of dollars impact in Q4, and a small impact to 2024, which is already included in our guidance. Now, switching to the second driver of revenue growth, how we monetize time with consumers, essentially how we grow yield. Yield represents the revenue we can generate per user. For comparison, we estimate Meta makes $200 of revenue per user a year in the U.S. Snap makes $33, and we make about $3.00 to $4.00 per user a year."", ""While I think Taboola is among the best in the open web when it comes to monetizing user attention, you can imagine how much runway we have to improve, and how much better the open web can do. When we win, the open web wins. Now, the open web is about an $80 billion market because it uses low yield monetization capabilities invented 30 years ago, such as display banners, text ads, interstitials, and more. And on top of that, only in the open web advertisers are asked to bid using CPC or CPM, which companies like Google or Meta don't do. Now there are three ways Taboola will grow yield. The first one is data. This is where code on page being bigger and getting a large volume of clicks from the network, makes us better at driving conversions to advertisers faster."", ""The second one is AI. Deep learning is really hard to do. We've been at it for years. And, this is a key element as it relates to matchmaking between users to information. And, the third one is advertisers. We've 15,000 to 20,000 advertisers as of now while Google and Meta have 10 million advertisers each. Bringing more advertisers means better diversity and personalization to offer users the ad they may like. We're seeing great momentum from Maximize Conversions, our advanced AI biding technology. Advertisers are seeing up to 50% boost in conversions while maintaining their cost per acquisition or CPA. As well as, some advertisers are seeing reduced CPA by nearly 20%. Let's give an example. If you sold 10 flower bouquets with Taboola and it's cost you $30 to get a single costumer, you can now sell the same 10 bouquets at the cost of $24 per customer."", ""Or, sell up to 15 bouquets at the same $30 cost to acquire that customer. Now that's selling a lot more flowers and saving more which is great. Now as more advertisers adopt our AI and Max Conversions, we expect improved retention, essentially lower churn, as well as increase in net dollar retention, NDRs, which means advertisers are able to spend more with us over time. In Q4, we launched Generative AI ad maker helping advertisers kick off a campaign faster. For self-serviced advertisers, one is four new creative are being generated using our new Generative AI. In 2024, we are focused on enhancing our data integration with Yahoo, continuing adoption, and improvement to maximize conversions as well as launching a new maximized optimization product called Maximize Revenue."", ""Maximize Revenue is the way for advertisers that have direct value associated with conversions like in ecommerce space to optimize their desired return on investment. I am happy to say that with this momentum where already 50% of our revenue is driven by advertisers who adopted Max Conversion and are at steady roadmap were back to yield growth this year. Another segment of advertisers that is helping us drive yield growth and seen momentum is ecommerce. In 2023, we've benefited from the combined fire power of Connexity, Skimlinks, and Taboola. We launched Turnkey Commerce, which is where we partner with publishers to establish or expand their commerce business. This is in high demand, we essentially created commerce content, drive traffic to it, and monetize it."", ""All powered by Taboola. I am very, very happy to say that at the end of 2023, we signed an agreement with the Associate Press, one of the largest and most trusted news publishers in the world, to power its new ecommerce destination using Taboola Turnkey Commerce. Ecommerce represents approximately 20% of ex-TAC. It's premium revenue. And we continue to see it as an important growth driver for Taboola in years to come. Now as I am wrapping up my part, I would be remise in not acknowledging that our industry is facing tectonic changes this year like cookie deprecation, gen AI, and the need for performance advertising in times of recession and market softness. And, we are so ready. We have more code on page than anyone. We understand intent with users clicking on Taboola tens of billions of times a year."", ""And if history is a proxy for the future, we did well when Apple deprecated cookies. In summary, we are coming in strong into 2024 with stunning partnership, fresh revenue growth, and a strong EBITDA and free cash flow profile. We're now seeing a new $100 million buyback authorization. And after two years of yield been soft, we are back to growth as our clients adopt AI faster than any product developed since I started Taboola. With that, let me the pass the call over to Steve to review our financials and outlook in more detail."", ""Stephen Walker: Thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. As Adam mentioned, we had a strong end to 2023. Our Q4 revenues were approximately $420 million and grew 13% year over year, accelerating from Q3 levels. Ex-TAC's gross profit was $169 million, which represented growth of 6% year over year. Ex-TAC growth was driven by double-digit growth in advertising spend and included a small contribution from Yahoo in the quarter. These positive factors were partially offset by margin compression due to the ad rate declines in 2022, which have since stabilized in 2023. Net income was $3.7 million, and non-GAAP net income was $31.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $50.1 million, representing a 30% adjusted EBITDA margin. Year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was down, which was due primarily to higher expenses related to the onboarding of Yahoo's supply that were not in the year-ago period."", 'Operating expenses excluding Yahoo would have been relatively flat year-over-year, reflecting strong cost discipline in 2023, which we plan to continue into 2024. For the full-year of 2023, we finished with over $1.4 billion in revenue, $536 million in ex-Tac gross profit, and $99 million in adjusted EBITDA. We had a net loss of $82 million and non-GAAP net income of $33 million. We also generated $52 million of free cash flow in 2023, which was up 181% versus 2022. Free cash flow benefited from the stronger than forecasted adjust EBITDA, which reflects the cost controls mentioned previously, partially offset by the expenses related to the onboarding of Yahoo inventory in the period. Free cash flow in Q4 would have been even stronger if not for the timing of some payables and capital expenditures that we mentioned were delayed last quarter.', ""As Adam said, our strong revenue and Ex-Tac gross profit performance was driven by strength in our e-commerce, bidding, and Taboola News businesses, as well as the initial contributions from Yahoo and relatively stable yields in our core business. E-commerce had double-digit growth in 2023, driven by strong growth in advertising budgets from some of our largest retail advertisers, as well as strong momentum in Europe. In addition, we are seeing great success ramping Taboola's feeds and now Yahoo as supply sources for our retail advertisers. In fact, Taboola's feed supply has become a top ten traffic source globally for these advertisers. As we have stated previously, Taboola News grew very quickly and exceeded $100 million in revenues in 2023."", 'In total, e-commerce, Taboola News, and Header Bidding now represent approximately 30% of our ex-Tac gross profit. This is exciting because each represents very valuable forms of supply that are valued by high-quality advertisers. Our teams have achieved accelerating revenue and ex-Tac performance while improving cost efficiency, indicated by our strong adjusted EBITDA margin exiting 2023. Operating expenses were $489 million in 2023, up $11 million year-over-year as a result of the cost incurred to onboard the significant inventory we are gaining with the addition of Yahoo. Excluding Yahoo, as I mentioned earlier, operating expenses were essentially flat with the prior year. Our headcount is down approximately 2.5% from its peak in July of 2022.', 'With our ongoing expense discipline and our strong growth expectations, we expect that in 2024 we will approach our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 30%. GAAP net loss for 2023 of $82 million included amortization of intangibles of $63.9 million, share-based compensation expenses of $53.7 million, and holdback compensation expenses related to the -- connects the acquisition of $10.6 million, all of which were excluded from non-GAAP net income. Our non-GAAP net income of $32.6 million was above the high end of our guidance range. In terms of cash generation, we had approximately $84.4 million in operating cash flow in 2023 and free cash flow of $52.2 million. This includes net publisher prepayments, which were a source of cash of $19.7 million, and interest payments on our long-term debt, which were a use of cash of $18.5 million.', ""As I have highlighted in previous quarters, I would note that net publisher prepayments were a source of cash for the full-year due to the fact that new prepayments were lower than the amortization of historical prepayments. Let's turn to the balance sheet. You can see that our net cash balance remains healthy. Our net cash position of $36.2 million remained positive at the end of Q4, even after share repurchases. Cash and cash equivalents, plus our short-term investments decreased from $250.7 million at the end of Q3 to $181.8 million at the end of Q4. This reflected a $50 million prepayment of our debt and $32 million used for share buyback activity in Q4. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments remained above our debt principal balance of $142.2 million."", 'Speaking of our share repurchases, I would also like to provide an update on our share buyback and debt repayment programs. The share buyback program was initiated on June 1, and as of December 30, we had repurchased over 15 million shares at an average price of $3.62 for total repurchases of $55.1 million. The average repurchase price of $3.62 represented a return of approximately 30% based on our closing price on Monday. Today, we are also announcing a new share buyback authorization of $100 million that replaces our former buyback plan, which was largely exhausted. We are fortunate enough to be able to fund our organic growth investments from our operating cash flow. Given that, we believe that at current valuations the best use of our free cash flow is to buy back shares.', 'To the extent that we have additional cash to deploy, we intend to pay down our long-term debt. We did this in October of 2023, in fact when we voluntarily prepaid another $50 million of our long-term debt, bringing the total debt that we have voluntarily prepaid to $141 million. As always, both the share repurchase program and the debt pay-down are contingent upon the availability of sufficient working capital. As an Israeli company, we are also required to obtain Israeli court approval for share repurchases. Also of note, we will be filing a general purpose shelf in the coming days. We consider it good corporate hygiene for a company at our stage to have a general purpose shelf on file. Given we believe our stock is a great value at current levels and have announced a new buyback authorization today, we obviously do not intend to issue new shares at this time.', ""I just wanted to make sure that was clear. Now let me shift to our forward-looking guidance. As Adam mentioned earlier, in the last 12 months, we invested in technology that advanced our e-commerce and Taboola News offerings, successfully launched maximized conversions and onboarded all of Yahoo's global native supply onto the Taboola network. 2023 was a year in which we invested heavily in these initiatives, sometimes in advance of revenue. As we look ahead, we see the following tailwinds driving outsized growth in our business through 2025. First, we expect the Yahoo Advertiser migration to be materially complete by Q3 2024 and to continue ramping into 2025. Second, we expect yield growth to turn positive in 2024. Third, we expect a phased onboarding of the supply from our new iconic consumer brand partner in 2024 and 2025."", 'And lastly, we expect further yield gains over time as the volume of our contextual data increases with the addition of Yahoo and other supply to our network, which will further enhance yield. As a result, we are initiating guidance for 2024 that includes strong top line growth and improving profitability. We expect revenue of $1.89 billion to $1.94 billion, which represents growth of 33% at the midpoint. We expect gross profit of $535 million to $555 million and ex-TAC gross profit of $656 million to $679 million. That ex-TAC is up roughly 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are reiterating our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance of over $200 million and free cash flow expectation of over $100 million. I will note that the adjusted EBITDA guidance represents a doubling of that metric versus 2023.', ""Finally, we are expecting non-GAAP net income of $84 million to $104 million in 2024. We continue to be very by the addition of Yahoo to our business. Adam mentioned earlier we feel good about the progress with Yahoo, and we expect revenue on Yahoo to exceed $100 million in Q1. For competitive purposes and due to the fact that Yahoo's supply has been fully integrated into our broader publisher network, we will treat disclosures around Yahoo similarly to how we treat other major publishers on our network on a going-forward basis. Finally, we are introducing Q1 2024 guidance. This quarter, we expect revenues of $387 million to $413 million, gross profit of $94 million to $106 million, ex-TAC gross profit of $123 million to $135 million, adjusted EBITDA of $10 million to $17 million, and non-GAAP net income of negative $15 million to negative $3 million."", 'Let me finish by saying that we are happy with our fourth quarter performance, and excited about the step change growth that we are expecting in our business in 2024. The growth investments we have made in 2023, the additional scale that Yahoo is bringing, and the additional supply we will be onboarding as part of a new partnership with an iconic consumer brand is accelerating our journey towards becoming a must-buy for advertisers looking to reach consumers in the open web. With that, let me pass it back to Adam for some closing remarks.', ""Adam Singolda: Thanks, Steve. I've never been more bullish about Taboola, and I'm so proud of our Taboolars' dedication, passion, making us the high-performing company through the most difficult of times. We're coming in strong into 2024, making it a record year for us. Revenue is growing 33% to $2 billion, ex-TAC is growing 25% to nearly $670 million, EBITDA is doubling to over $200 million, free cash flow is nearly doubling to over $100 million. And on the back of these numbers, we're now seeing an authorization of $100 million of buyback, essentially looking to buy 6% of our company. As I mentioned, our industry is changing. And with companies like Netflix and Disney, Uber, DoorDash, Amazon, and more expending through advertising initiatives, I suspect we're in the beginning of an exciting ad mania."", ""Taboola has a chance of becoming the partner of choice to many of them. And as I said at the beginning of our call, in addition to Yahoo, I'm incredibly excited to have just signed another iconic consumer brand that validates Taboola's advertising-in-a-box value proposition. Our vision is to become the recommendation engine for the open web, and build the very first multibillion dollar gateway for advertisers to reach publishers, OEMs, and apps outside of walled gardens. Today is a good day for us. I'm excited to get 2024 going. To everyone, thank you for being part of our journey. And with that, let's open it up to questions.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Tapestry investors that purchase the stock on or after the 7th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 25th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.35 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.40 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Tapestry has a trailing yield of 3.0% on the current share price of US$47.22. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Tapestry ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Tapestry paid out a comfortable 32% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 23% of its cash flow last year."", ""It's positive to see that Tapestry's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Tapestry has grown its earnings rapidly, up 24% a year for the past five years. Tapestry is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. It looks like the Tapestry dividends are largely the same as they were 10 years ago."", ""Should investors buy Tapestry for the upcoming dividend? Tapestry has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business.

If the definition is the ability to pass human tests, Huang said, artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive soon.', '""If I gave an AI ... every single test that you can possibly imagine, you make that list of tests and put it in front of the computer science industry, and I\'m guessing in five years time, we\'ll do well on every single one,"" said Huang, whose firm hit $2 trillion in market value on Friday.', 'As of now, AI can pass tests such as legal bar exams, but still struggles on specialized medial tests such as gastroenterology. But Huang said that in five years it should also be able to pass any of them.', 'But by other definitions, Huang said, AGI may be much further away, because scientists still disagree on how to describe how human minds work.', '""Therefore, it\'s hard to achieve as an engineer"" because engineers need defined goals, Huang said.', 'Huang also addressed a question about how many more chip factories, called ""fabs"" in the industry, are needed to support the expansion of the AI industry. Media reports have said OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman thinks many more fabs are needed.', 'Huang said that more will be needed, but each chip will also get better over time, which acts to limit the number of chips needed.', '""We\'re going to need more fabs. However, remember that we\'re also improving the algorithms and the processing of (AI) tremendously over time,"" Huang said.

It passed up mighty Alphabet and Amazon to become the third-most-valuable ""Magnificent Seven"" stock, and it briefly topped a $2 trillion market cap valuation. And yet, though it\'s the third largest business of the Magnificent Seven by market cap, it\'s still the smallest as measured by annual sales.', ""Some evidence of this fact is that Nvidia stock trades for a whopping 66 times trailing-12-month earnings per share. However, Nvidia may not be nearly as expensive as it appears to be, even after the stock's incredible 400%-plus run higher since the start of 2023."", ""Much can be said about Nvidia's rise, the current data center investment supercycle driven by generative artificial intelligence (AI) that Nvidia helped spawn, and whether semiconductor peers can catch up and take some of Nvidia's market share."", ""But as far as Nvidia is concerned, calendar year 2024 (fiscal 2025 for Nvidia, the 12-month period that will end in January 2025) could be another epic year. After reporting full-year revenue of $60.9 billion, a 126% increase over the depressed results from calendar year 2022 during the bear market, management is forecasting $24 billion in sales for fiscal 2025's Q1, the three months that will end in April 2024. That's 40% of all of last year's sales in a single quarter."", ""CEO Jensen Huang said on the earnings call that Nvidia's supply of computing accelerator system parts is improving. However, Huang and company still expect overall demand this next year to be higher than what Nvidia and its partners can crank out. That implies quarterly sales could continue to tick higher from the end of Q1 and on."", ""But even if we simply annualize Nvidia's Q1 expected revenue, we arrive at just shy of $100 billion in this year's sales, about a 57% increase from last year. For the record, that would dramatically help Nvidia catch up to the other Magnificent Seven in terms of annual sales (see chart below)."", 'And if we factor for a bit of gross profit margin contraction, resulting from a benefit from favorable parts supply at the moment, annual operating expenses of $14 billion (the Q1 outlook for operating expenses of $3.5 billion multiplied by four), and a tax rate of 17%, Nvidia could be pacing toward $50 billion in operating income or more. That would be a 50% increase over last year.', ""Based on these back-of-the-envelope expectations, Nvidia stock is trading for about 35 to 40 times this year's earnings, far lower than the aforementioned 66 times trailing-12-month earnings ($2 trillion market cap divided by $50 billion in net income and/or free cash flow)."", 'Of course, even this forward-looking earnings multiple hardly makes Nvidia stock cheap. Far from it, this valuation is in anticipation of Nvidia remaining in high-growth mode for quite some time. Wild estimates like seeing global AI infrastructure reach $400 billion in annual spending by 2027 -- an estimate Advanced Micro Devices has cited a few times now, which assumes a roughly doubling in global data center value from $1 trillion this past year to $2 trillion in three years -- has many investors are putting gobs of cash on the line with this as an assumption.', ""But it's important to remember that Nvidia's business has always been cyclical -- periods of multi-year growth are followed by a year or two of contraction, before fresh highs are reached again. This isn't likely to change."", 'Thus, investors should be on guard for a significant slowdown, or even a pullback, in AI infrastructure spending, perhaps late this year or in 2025. That could send Nvidia stock spiraling, much as past cyclical downturns have done.', ""Does that mean Nvidia stock is to be avoided right now? I'm not ready to say that just yet. If the AI infrastructure market does keep growing through 2027, Nvidia stock may not be done just yet. But given the current valuation, investors looking to get in on the action should be cautious. Consider using a dollar-cost average plan to scale into a position over time, taking advantage of any inevitable dips along the way.

You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by the aforementioned Jim Gillies. Jim, thanks for being here."", ""Jim Gillies: Thanks, Ricky for that intro. Let's indeed ask me those questions."", ""Ricky Mulvey: The story this morning that is unavoidable is the Capital One wants Discover. There will be questions among US regulators because headlines are acting like this is a done deal. Let's set the terms out first though. It's a $35 billion all-stock deal. The combo would surpass JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup by credit card volume according to Bloomberg. First and foremost, why does Capital One want this business?"", ""Jim Gillies: Well, they want it. The famous or infamous word, I guess would be scale. Discover is the smallest of the four US major global payment networks, so they're about to get bigger. They want to leverage the investments, they being Capital One, leverages the investments and their network they've put down for the last decades, and they can do that by getting larger very quickly with as you say an all-stock deal. They are claiming and you should always look at these claims with a very healthy shaker of salt, let's put it that way. They're claiming there will be strong returns on invested capital, post-deal synergies totaling about $2.7 billion, I think, through 2027, or it'll take until 2027 to fully realize that. But I think the Empire building is a thing, Ricky, and this is Capital One taking the next step on building their position to challenge the folks, as you mentioned, like JPMorgan and Citigroup."", ""Ricky Mulvey: But the shareholders of Capital One aren't too happy about it, even with these advertised synergies and scale building, they're going to get access to essentially a payment network that they didn't have before, where they had to go out to Visa and MasterCard to get their credit cards out there, and yet they don't seem too happy about it."", ""Jim Gillies: Well, last I saw it was down what one or 2%, Capital One. They're reacting a little bit, or some people are reacting and say, we want to get out of the way of this. I think that's a little silly. Capital One is not richly valued right now. Frankly, I think let's put, it looks pretty decent. I think Discovery is also similarly reasonably valued. Stock Advisor Canada has a recommendation on Discover Financial, for example, and the analyst covering that, Buck Hartzell, is very enthused about the company. I don't think he's terribly thrilled about it going away. It's a scale building, these types of acquisitions do happen all the time, which I suppose is a nice little softball to you to ask about regulatory issues."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's do it."", 'Jim Gillies: There you go.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Usually you do a softball question, not a softball answer for a softball question. But all the headlines are making this sound like it's a done deal from what I've read this morning, and then there's a little bottom paragraph where it's like it still has some regulatory hurdles to clear. There's a lot of big mergers that have been falling apart lately, and it seems like those watching this story, those invested in Discover, like Buck Hartzell, maybe he still has some hope that this could be a stand-alone company."", ""Jim Gillies: On the subject of regulatory approvals or not, look in a world where Amazon buying iRobot can fall apart because of regulatory concerns, admittedly, that was the European Union who were saying, Amazon's going to delist all their rival vacuum folks on their platform and that will hurt iRobot, which is a little silly. But whatever. I have to think that Capital One and Discover who jointly released the press release today, the CEO of Discover is widely quoted in the press release. Three members of the Discover Financial board are going to be joining Capital One board. I would like to think basic due diligence has had both parties run this up the flagpole in terms of legal and probably regulatory expert folks. Now, my take on this is look, again, Discover is the smallest of the big four. Visa, MasterCard, Amex, all much larger than Discover. On the banking side, which is more where Capital One is held."", ""Capital One is like number 10 in the US in terms of total deposits, Discover is at 26. The deal will move them to about number six in the US after of course, the big four, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and I think US Bank is number five. This would move them up to number six, but they'd still be one-third in terms of deposit base. They'd be one-third the size of Citigroup and Wells Fargo, less than one-third, actually. If you prevent this on an anti-competitive basis, you're sending a second message."", ""The second message is the big four are all that matter, and we will block anyone coming to any semblance of scale with the big four. I think that actually would send a worst method. Now it doesn't mean that it won't get regulatory scrutiny, and they might have to hive off one or two things to make it sure. But I think it's not the same, obviously, but Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard, where there was some concerns about that going on there. I think this will take longer than is expected, but I think it will ultimately get done. But that two bucks buys you coffee down the street. What do I know?"", 'Ricky Mulvey: Two bucks at the Capital One cafe.', 'Jim Gillies: There you go.', ""Ricky Mulvey: You get a coffee and do your banking. Let's go to Home Depot earnings. On Friday, JMo made Home Depot radar stock. He said he was going to be curious about the inflationary story, not much of an inflationary story on the call. In fact we have disinflation, which was interestingly brought up. I think it has to do with lumber, but why is disinflation a problem for Home Depot right now?"", ""Jim Gillies: I don't think it is. Disinflation is just a slowing of the rate of inflation. It's not deflation. Disinflation is arguably what we've been doing for the past two years, trying to slow the rate of inflation. That's why we've hiked, we being the federal banks of both of our countries, hiking rates. I don't think it's that much of a problem. I think these companies like Home Depot have seen all manner of economic environments before. I think the long-term investor just looks at this and doesn't particularly care. Investing is an expectations game, and expectations, they were already set, they were going to be light. They've been light for the last year. They'd be light again this year. But you knew they were going to be light. I think I am going to go in a bit of a sermon here. I know, act shocked. Home Depot is probably one of my favorite, if not my favorite case study for a company that transitions from growth mode to cash-cow. No one noticed."", ""They noticed, but 16 years ago now. In fiscal 2008, which their fiscal year is ending in February, it's always weird. This is a company that had been in major growth mode. They've been growing their store base by somewhat like 8% a year or somewhat like that before that and 2008, they only did about two-and-a-half billion, $2.2 billion in free cash flow in that last year of growth mode, and their store count was like just over $2,200, and their capex was $3.6 billion, which is actually higher than what the most recent is. Today, the store count has gone nowhere. I think they've grown at 0.3% annually for the last 16 years, but cash flow has exploded. Home Depot is a story of a dominant company in, effectively, an oligopoly. Lowes, you can argue it's an oligopoly. Yes, there's mom-and-pop hardware stores everywhere, but whatever."", ""They've turned into cash flow mode, and the cash flow exploded. The last 16 years since they went from rapid store growth, plow all their cash flow into growing the store count to, we're just going to do maintenance, very slow growth that they're calling for 12 stores this year. They're probably going to close a couple as well, so net store growth probably won't be 12. They have produced $143 billion in free cash flow for the past 16 years. They have thrown all of it at share buybacks, which has reduced the share count by 41%, and ever-rising dividends, they've just jacked their dividend to nine dollars a share for this coming year. When they stopped their major growth trajectory, like I said in 2008, they were at $0.90 a share. They've 10-folded their dividend."", ""On a dividend-adjusted basis over the past 16 years, Home Depot, mature giant cash-cow company, has given investors 20% annualized returns. Please tell me again, though, I know there's a bunch of growth-focused investors who like to say, when this happens, it's a sign of a company maturing and all the good stuff has gone. It's been about 16 years, 20% annualized. I'm picking a straw man, obviously. But please tell me how much better the new growth changing the world has done over the 20% annualized put up for the past 16 years at poky no-growth Home Depot, who still has their competitive position unchanged by the way. I go on, I'll wait."", ""Ricky Mulvey: They offered. I want to meet this straw man who's ready to go to town on Home Depot."", ""Jim Gillies: I can give you a name or two, but we'll talk after the show."", ""Ricky Mulvey: What you just described is why Home Depot is able to essentially offer a soft forecast and the stock does not flinch. That's always the story. Earnings beat expectations, stock forecast is down and then the stock gets pummeled. Let's go to Griffon Corp, which is a story you haven't heard. It's not going to be in the headline of today's show. But we're Slacking this morning, and I offer up some stories, you give some takes on it. You wanted to talk about, and I'm quoting now, a maker of fine residential and commercial garage roll-up doors in garden rakes run by a well-comped, in-depth artistic management team."", 'Jim Gillies: Guilty as charged.', 'Ricky Mulvey: I was like, we can talk about some other things, but I feel like Jim wants to talk about this story. This is an activist story, seems like the activist plays worked out. Give us the story with Griffon Corp here.', ""Jim Gillies: Sure. Yes, Griffon Corp is that very thing. They are well-comped. One of the reasons why the activist Voss Capital showed up a couple of years ago is, do you see what these guys are getting paid basically? They pointed to a myriad of compensation plans that seem to basically need a pulse, and they'd be met in full. In fact, the pulse might be optional on a couple of them. They pointed out Voss Capital, that is pointed out that the CEO, who is a gentleman, Rob Kramer. I believe his name is the CEO and Chairman that he made more for this tiny little company. I think today it's barely a four billion dollar company. Again, they make roll-up doors, garage doors, garden rakes, garden hose. They own the Hunter Douglas fan, the old ceiling fan brand. That guy made more than the CEOs of some other companies you've heard of one, we've already talked about Home Depot, Starbucks, and Disney."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Old Bobby? Your favorite entertainment CEO, Bob Iger?', ""Jim Gillies: I was going to say, I'm going to hold off on the Bob Iger love [laughs] right now. They said the board was compromised, was full of cronies. I came to the story about a year into the activist fight. They already had one fight and they were calling for a division to be sold off. I recommended it in Hidden Gems Canada in January of 2023, and I think one market day later, they announced the deal with the activist because I was gearing up for another fight and I love a lot of good activist fight. They announced that the head of Voss Capital, who'd already got one of their directors onto the board anyway, in the previous fight, they were announcing that the the lead for Voss Capital was himself joining the board, and they announced the standstill agreement."", ""We're all going to work together and kumbaya, and we're going to bring it everything together. We're going to create shareholder value for people. They sold off the previous division, but they were in the middle of a strategic review. That strategic review disappointed everyone except apparently me when it came out a couple of months later because everyone is expecting a sale of the company. Instead, it came out that, we're going to give you two dollars a share, special dividend, and we're going to up our buyback program. Stock promptly fell from the mid 30s to the mid 20s, very nice time to add by the way. But since then they've paid that special dividend, they've hiked the regular dividend twice. They have indeed been very aggressive in operational improvements that has led to more cash flow and that cash flow is lead to better buybacks, a little bit of debt repayment."", ""They got serious about board refreshment, so they actually got rid of a couple of the directors who had been there for forever and ever. The reason I call them nepotistic as the CEO is the son-in-law of the former CEO who himself was the son of the former CEO before him. I'm not scared by that kind of stuff because frankly, I think when you have people so nakedly looking out for their own self-interest, maybe who view to align yourself with their self-interest. But the thing that came out this morning that I think is kind of the end of the activist story. So why Griffon is going forward, is going to have to earn its place in your portfolio based on performance alone, is the word came out that Voss Capital is selling 1.5 million shares to Griffon themselves at a 3% discount to the market. So that's nice, I like that. But this will take their holdings from about 2.8-2.9 million shares down by 1.5 million."", ""It'll take them below the 5% threshold where you have to report, and the lead of Voss Capital is leaving the board. Now, they gave all the right words and said we're going to keep on owning shares. However, they can now sell without needing to file a form for the rest of their holdings, so it'll be interesting. But this is a stock again, Griffon Corp, maker of garage doors and yard implements. The stock is up. Basically, it's a double over the past year. It's up about 120%, if you did take the conclusion of the strategic review as a buy signal, that's about nine months ago. If I can be said to try anything, it's, I like to preach that you can make market beating returns in odd and weird places. You don't have to go for whatever is super-hyped in in the media at this time. You can find it in Home Depot as we talked about. You can find it in people who sell stuff to Home Depot, like Griffon Corp. So I thought it was an interesting story that most Motley Fool Money listeners probably haven't heard of."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Well. I think we just hit the SMCI story with that as well, so we're about out of time, Jim Gillies.

The Valentine's day is over and it's time for a little heartbreak. This time, Jason and Bill shared the ones that got away."", ""Alison Southwick: Last week, Jason Moser and Bill Mann joined us in a studio to talk about the great loves of their life, by which we mean, of course, investing in stocks. But you know what, that was last week. This week, it's time to talk about the heartbreak of investing. You guys ready, I've tissues nearby if you need them."", 'Bill Mann: Valentines is over, back to cynicism. Here we go.', ""Jason Moser: We're going to power through."", 'Alison Southwick: Here we go. So our first question today is to talk about the one that got away, by which we mean a stock that you never got around to buying and wish you had.', ""Jason Moser: Yeah, there are a lot. There a lot that I can put on this list. My recency bias is going to bring Nvidia here front and center. I'll go with Nvidia because it's funny. One of my roles here, I'm the advisor for Augmented Reality and Beyond service, and when i started that service almost five years ago, Nvidia was one of the stocks I recommended. They made a lot of sense at the time and I remember digging into the company thinking, these guys are coming around and doing a lot of cool stuff. This is a stock I really probably want to own. As I mentioned before on the previous episode, we have internal trading guidelines that make it a little bit tricky sometimes for us, just people transact whenever we want."", ""So it was just never a stock that was open. It was never available for me to actually go in there and purchase, so I didn't at the time it sort of left my mind and never thought about it. Five years later, it's up like 2,000%. Now, I'm thrilled that I've got it on the card for our members because our members have clearly one big from Nvidia. That's one where I looked back and I think, man, I should've just kept that on my radar and I just didn't catch it. I wish, I did because I feel like they still got a lot to do."", ""Robert Brokamp: I'll just add a little bit about the training guidelines for people who are curious. That is, once The Motley Fool has recommended or discuss the stock, we are as employees prevented from buying it for I don't know what it is 10 days or something like that. Then also if you own it and you want to sell it, you have to check and see if we've mentioned it, recommend you can't sell it. It does limit a little bit of the investment flexibility of working here."", ""Alison Southwick: Bill, how about for you? What's the one that got away?"", ""Bill Mann: I read this assignment as something that I had recommended for members and had never gotten around to buying myself, and the answer was a company that I loved the moment that I recommended it and never went back and bought it. It was a company called TransDigm, which since that point in time, and I looked this up and it was painful to do so it's up 4,500%."", 'Robert Brokamp: Oh, goodness gracious.', ""Bill Mann: TransDigm, what they do is they make basically all of the parts inside of an airplane tube. The tube itself is Boeing or Airbus, but all of the components inside are built by other companies. By other companies, I basically mean TransDigm. They did almost everything else inside Boeing planes. It turns out when you sell those sorts of things that works out really well, and I thought it was going to work out really, really well, and it has worked out really really well for a lot of people who are not me because I didn't buy it."", ""Alison Southwick: Do you feel it's too late to ask them out?"", ""Bill Mann: It's water under the bridge at this point. It's felt expensive for the entire time and for the entire time that's been wrong. Maybe."", ""Alison Southwick: It's not in your league now maybe. What about NVIDIA? Is it too late? Can you call out to Nvidia and be like"", ""Jason Moser: Not too late as far as the business goes now. The valuation is one where I feel like, I'm going to be patient here. I'm going to be patient and let it come back to me. If she comes back to me. [laughs]"", ""Bill Mann: You're talking about the Taylor Swift of stocks, right now my friend"", ""Alison Southwick: She's moving on."", ""Bill Mann: She's on TV and you're not."", 'Alison Southwick: Next question. Tom, we actually covered this a bit last week, but tell us about the one that broke your heart by which I mean, a stock that you bought and it just went nowhere.', ""Jason Moser: This one's funny for me because it's one that really did well for a while until it just didn't. That's Under Armour. Under Armour is one that had?"", 'Bill Mann: I dated Under Armour too.', ""Jason Moser: So much potential. We saw that stretch of time where Kevin Plank really seemed to have the answer for everything and then they just hit a wall and it was self-inflicted errors. I mean, he just made some strategic blunders. I think that really sent the company into a not a death spiral, but certainly something that's been very difficult for them to recover from. Thankfully it was a smaller position. It's not something that was naturally material to my portfolio. It was one where I was considering, maybe this is one we need to keep building this out. This could be the next Nike-like story until it became apparent that it probably wasn't going to be so. To be clear, I still own those shares today. It's a small, meaningless position, but I was telling you before about I default and not selling. The funny thing is, I think Under Armour makes great stuff, I'm wearing Under Armour pants. I mean, I love them. They just can't get that business in order. It's really interesting to watch. I remember before Bill, how we would talk about Lululemon versus Under Armour. I mean, all of these."", ""Bill Mann: Nobody's talking about that anymore."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. It's just, it's fascinating to see how well Lululemon's performed while watching Under Armour just completely flounder. It's been a real lesson."", ""Alison Southwick: What's been a difference you think?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, I think certainly just vision and leadership. Leadership with Under Armour, they've just never had any kind of consistent vision as to what they wanted to do with the business and recovering from those strategic blunders that Plank made long ago and most of that was in regards to supply chain management. It's just been a difficult road for him."", ""Bill Mann: I'm still completely distracted by the fact that you used the word brodie. [laughs]"", 'Robert Brokamp: To the max even, to the max. [laughs]', ""Bill Mann: Yeah. I think it's meaningful that off the top of your head know exactly the name of the founder of Under Armour and don't know the founder of Lululemon. They have a much more professional management."", 'Jason Moser: Was that Chip Wilson?', 'Bill Mann: Yeah.', 'Jason Moser: Now Wilson is out of the picture.', 'Alison Southwick: Wilson was a bit problematic.', 'Robert Brokamp: Arguably controversial.', ""Jason Moser: I'll argue a little bit out there. I don't know that much about him, but it was very clear that there were like, look we got to part ways and get this thing back on track. Under Armour has not had that luxury because Plank is still the majority owner of that business. Split those shares out. He's controlling the whole thing. I mean, I think we could argue that's a bad move and clearly investors have loss from that."", ""Bill Mann: I'm not suggesting that Wilson was the one that got away by the way. [laughs] I am simply saying that they had a professional management team and structure in place whereas with Under Armour, Kevin Plank's basically up their Napoleon style pointing here, we go there. If you're going to be a Napoleon, you'd better bring it and he hasn't."", ""Alison Southwick: What's the stock that broke your heart, Bill?"", ""Bill Mann: Mine's Kahoot."", 'Alison Southwick: Kahoot?', 'Bill Mann: You know Kahoot. The little Kahoots, the quizzes that basically?', 'Alison Southwick: Yeah, I know Kahoot.', 'Bill Mann: Got your kids 80% of the learning they did during the pandemic.', 'Alison Southwick: Yeah, the little quizzes.', ""Bill Mann: It was a great little company and we recommended it almost when it was pre-revenue. They were building up their business, didn't even have a marketing team. It was all word of mouth and just exploding. It was one of those companies that simply and I wouldn't take the other side of this, I wouldn't want the other experience, but it was one of those companies that really took hold during the pandemic and then lost its grip on the other side. Again, I don't wish we were still in the pandemic so that Kahoot would be doing well, but it's such a company with a purpose that I really wanted it to financially succeed more than it has."", ""Alison Southwick: Our last question is for you all. Now, this was the one that got Jason squirming in his seats, so we'll see if if it's true. The one time you cheated, by which we mean an investment that generally goes against your principles or what you've recommended to readers and listeners here."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, I think the reason why I squirm is because I look at these tickers and I'm like, yeah, they're not working out and yet I still own them and I don't know why. Oftentimes, I own them because, I either I'm holding out hope that things will turn around, or they serve as living lessons and reminders. I think in this case these are reminders. One of the rules I tend to espouse, and I follow it for the most part but every once in a while I stray, is to just not buy into IPOs, give it some time. I like to see four quarters of reporting. I want to understand how this management team works. What they're focused on, how they report, metrics."", ""Every once in a while I do stray and two that standout, I'll give you two here, Eventbrite and Unity Software, a couple of companies that I bought into early on in their public lives. They just struck me as interesting businesses with a lot of potential. I didn't worry so much about the valuations and the enthusiasm behind this stuff. Because with IPOs, that can often be a drawback as the enthusiasm that's there pushes those valuations up a little bit irrationally. Especially so in the case of Unity Software, given the time that it went public, but Eventbrite and Unity stand out to me as two where I should've listened to myself. I didn't. Maybe things will get better for them, but I'm not terribly optimistic at this point."", 'Alison Southwick: Bill, how about you?', ""Bill Mann: I have a basic rule and it is this, don't leave your money at risk of dictators."", ""Alison Southwick: We're getting back to Napoleon again."", ""Bill Mann: We are getting back to Napoleon again. I have a second rule and it is if the person who is running a company seems like a bad person, they are probably a bad person. I had recommended a company called JD.com, which is a Chinese company. It's a very interesting company, a clone of Amazon. Their CEO got in trouble with the law in a very bad way in Minnesota in I think 2019."", 'Alison Southwick: What was he doing in Minnesota?', 'Bill Mann: Getting in trouble.', 'Alison Southwick: You can get in that much trouble in Minnesota?', 'Robert Brokamp: Yeah. I went to a seminary in Minnesota and I had to storage.', ""Bill Mann: I don't know how to respond to that. But go on."", 'Alison Southwick: We will save that for another episode.', ""Jason Moser: You've left him speechless."", ""Bill Mann: Was arrested for messing around with a woman who was not his wife. You know what I mean? I found myself a little bit frozen by what do I do because we as analysts are supposed to focus on a business and you don't want to overreact to things, but you don't want to under-react to them either. In this case, given everything else about what was happening in China, the fact that it's not a particularly friendly environment to foreign capital, I should have just pulled the plug and just got out and said, listen, this is not a place where we need to risk our money. We have thousands of companies that we can invest in. Why would we remain exposed to this one?"", ""Alison Southwick: Let's close on a more optimistic note."", ""Bill Mann: Thank you. I really didn't want that to be the end."", ""Alison Southwick: No, we are going to close on an optimistic note here. Moser and Bill, is there any stock right now that you're maybe slipping notes to in-class and do you like me? Yes, no, maybe? Maybe a stock on your radar?"", ""Robert Brokamp: Of course, if you talk about it, then you can't buy it."", 'Bill Mann: What have I already mentioned?', ""Jason Moser: Well, I so yes, there is one that, I've recommended it in my Next-Gen Supercycle service and it's performed very well in a very short period of time. It's a company called Samsara and ultimately in connected Cloud operation, helping businesses connect all of their devices and vehicles and buildings and stuff like that. Samsara builds that technology, runs all the software behind it. The ticker is IOT, which is clever because of Internet of Things and all of that stuff, so it's an Internet of things kind of play. Speaking evaluation, the stock has taken off. The valuation is one where I'm like, it needs to come back to me before I can really start getting serious about those love letters. We're going from the notes to love letters. That's what I'm hoping. But that's one that I continue to really be be interested in."", 'Alison Southwick: IOT. Bill, how about you?', ""Bill Mann: Jason talks about all this technology. I'd like to talk shoes for a minute."", ""Jason Moser: We all got to wear shoes, I guess we don't all have to. We're all doing."", ""Bill Mann: We're all requested to wear shoes lots of times. Not that long ago, I was in Japan and was walking in a very fashionable part of Tokyo. There were all these little boutiques and one had a line going around the block. As an investor, that's the thing that makes me go, huh. The company was On Holdings, the running shoe company. No, they call themselves a movement company."", 'Alison Southwick: How do you spell that, O-N?', ""Bill Mann: Yeah, ON. The people will have heard of this even if you have not. It is a Swiss company co-invested by Roger Federer. The guy who founded it was a former triathlete who noticed that other triathletes were suffering from the same exact injuries and decided to try and develop a shoe that would be safer for people. They're fantastically comfortable. They very fetchingly called their technology Cloud technology, which is a great sounding thing for your feet. They're selling off like wildfire. A little bit of a challenging valuation, but in the very same way that Lululemon has always had a challenging valuation. This is a company that I am making goo-goo faces and the like just to see."", 'Alison Southwick: Eyebrows, eyebrows.', 'Bill Mann: Exactly.', ""Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

Since the start of 2023, the stock has risen over 440%. Nvidia's sheer size makes this rise even more impressive, as it is now the third-largest U.S. company behind Microsoft and Apple."", ""Because of this unbelievable rise, many investors (including myself) have missed out on some or all of this rise. But that doesn't mean you can't buy now. But should you? Let's find out."", ""Nvidia is at the core of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The computing power required to create advanced AI models is immense, and Nvidia's GPUs are the best in the world at performing this task. GPUs (graphics processing units) were created to process the calculations needed for gaming graphics, but their ability to efficiently process other workloads, like engineering simulations, drug discovery, and mining cryptocurrency, made their usage more widespread."", ""While a single GPU might be used for basic engineering simulations or a gaming computer, complex tasks like AI model training require hundreds or thousands of GPUs. With Nvidia's flagship GPU for data centers (the H100) rumored to cost around $30,000 a piece, it's easy to see why Nvidia's business has taken off with the AI gold rush beginning."", ""Getting the computing power necessary to train AI models is essentially the first task for any company interested in creating its own AI product. Purchasing a dedicated supercomputer isn't necessary for companies; these businesses can also rent computing power from cloud computing giants, who are also building out capacity for computing power that can be rented."", ""As a result, Nvidia's business has boomed, with revenue rising 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. Furthermore, it accelerated 22% from the previous quarter, which shows demand is increasing."", 'But just how long can this demand keep up? That question will determine if investors have missed out on Nvidia.', ""Unfortunately for investors, Nvidia doesn't provide a full-year outlook; management just offers a peek into the next quarter. Still, it gave guidance for revenue of $24 billion, indicating 234% revenue growth. That's an impressive figure and showcases how strong the demand is for GPUs."", 'However, third-party market research firms also believe this demand will persist for many years.', ""Global Market Insights expects the GPU market to reach $400 billion in 2032. With Nvidia posting revenue of $60.9 billion in fiscal year 2024, it's clear that it could continue to rise for some time."", 'This is a positive note for investors, as Nvidia is a hardware company.', ""Because Nvidia's products are one-time buys, purchasing additional GPUs isn't necessary unless a company wants to increase its computing power. This concerns many investors (including myself), as demand for Nvidia's GPUs may drop once initial computing capacity is built out. But with many market research firms confirming that this is just the beginning of the AI boom, it eases my mind to buy Nvidia stock."", ""Additionally, Nvidia's valuation isn't as far-fetched as it once was."", ""When valuing a company going through a massive transformation or growth phase, using the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't wise, as it looks inflated. But if you utilize forward earnings, you can see what the company may look like in one year by utilizing analyst projections instead of older results. This is one situation where forward-looking estimates can be more useful than the proven results of yesteryear."", ""If you do this with Nvidia, its price tag doesn't look too lofty anymore."", ""A forward P/E of 32 isn't that pricey, especially when Microsoft trades for 35 times forward earnings and Apple trades for 28."", ""So, have investors missed the boat on Nvidia stock? Yes. Nvidia won't be able to increase five times in value in just over a year again. But can it be a market-beating investment in the future? I think so."", 'The demand for GPUs will only continue to increase for a while, and Nvidia is set to cash in on this transition.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reinvigorated interest in AI and caused countless tech companies to restructure their businesses with an emphasis on the budding industry."", 'Increased demand for AI services boosted graphics processing unit (GPU) sales accordingly, as the chips are crucial for training AI models. As a leading chipmaker, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has massively profited from increased demand for GPUs, getting a head start in the industry and snapping up a majority market share in AI chips in 2023.', ""The chipmaker's earnings skyrocketed over the last year, with its stock delivering triple-digit growth since last February. Meanwhile, GPU demand looks unlikely to dissipate any time soon, as the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. Consequently, Nvidia remains one of the best ways to invest in the high-growth sector."", 'So, here is one AI stock that has created millionaires and will likely continue to make more.', ""Nvidia dominated the GPU market for years, significantly ahead of rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. The company's supremacy in the industry positioned it to immediately begin supplying its hardware to countless AI-minded companies right at the start of the AI boom last year."", ""As a result, Nvidia's stock is up 240% year over year, which has come alongside soaring earnings. In its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of 2024 ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data-center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales."", ""In addition to soaring earnings, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion."", ""So, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy."", ""Nvidia achieved an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI GPUs last year. The company's massive success in the industry motivated several tech companies to venture in as well. In 2024, AMD and Intel began shipping new AI GPUs designed to challenge Nvidia's offerings. However, chip-market trends indicate Nvidia's supremacy will be difficult for challengers to overcome."", ""Despite AMD and Intel's presence in the sector, Nvidia has held an over-80% market share in desktop GPUs for years. Intel only entered the industry last year, while AMD's history in desktop GPUs spans decades. Still, AMD's GPUs only account for about 10% of the market."", 'A similar situation occurred in the central processing unit (CPU) industry. Intel was king of CPUs for years, with an 82% market share at the start of 2017 when AMD landed on the scene with its Ryzen line of CPUs. ', ""AMD managed to steal a significant share from Intel. However, Intel is still responsible for most of the CPU market, with its share above 60% and AMD's at 36%."", 'Using the CPU market as a base of comparison, Nvidia could lose some AI GPU share to its competitors over the next year. However, it is unlikely to lose its leading position, allowing it to see major gains from AI for years.', ""Nvidia's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios plunged in the last year (as seen in the chart above), indicating its stock is at one of its best-valued positions in 12 months."", ""P/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share. Meanwhile, the P/FCF ratio divides its market cap by free cash flow. These are helpful valuation metrics as they take into account a company's financial health. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value. Nvidia's declining figures could make now the best time to consider adding its stock to your portfolio."", ""Along with a powerful position in AI and stellar financial growth, Nvidia is on a path to continue making millionaires, and you won't want to miss out."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The restructuring of the 30-stock index resulted in the exit of medical-retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance and the entry of the e-commerce super-giant Amazon.com Inc.."", 'The restructuring was initiated after the retail giant Walmart Inc. (WMT) decided on a 3-to-1 stock split. Unlike the other two major stock indexes — the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — the Dow is a price-weighted index and not a market-capital-weighted index.', 'The Dow, which started its journey in May 1896, is always inclined toward old-economy cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and oil-energy. However, its peers have more representation from growth sectors like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary.', 'As a result, the blue-chip index under performs its peers. In 2023, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 43.4%. The broad-market S&P 500 Index also saw an impressive rally of 23.9%. However, the Dow was up just 13.7%. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up 3.3%, 7.1%, and 8.6%, respectively.', ""Inclusion of Amazon is seen as a strategic move to increase the blue-chip index's exposure to new-economy stocks. Broadly, Amazon is categorized as a consumer discretionary company. However, its massive adoption of high-end technologies compelled a large-section of financial analysts to categorize it as a technology bigwig."", ""Amazon's entry will significantly increase the exposure of the blue-chip index in the e-commerce, consumer retail and technology space. Amazon's weight in the Dow will rank 17th out of the 30 stocks. Walmart's weight will drop to 26 from 17. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) will remain the most heavily weighted stock on the Dow."", 'On Feb 23, the Dow recorded its all-time highs of 39,282.28 on an intraday basis and 39,131.53 on a closing basis. Technically, at its current level of 38,972.41, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 38,027.55 and 35,253.78, respectively.', 'The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.', 'Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.', ""We have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for 2024.

The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to the performance of AWS. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers also favored the company. Moreover, AMZN's robust advertising business contributed well."", ""Notably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continues to act as a tailwind. AMZN's strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positives. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus."", 'Zacks Rank #1 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.5% and 40%, respectively, for the current year.

Consumer spending on T&E, which carries higher margins for AXP, is advancing well. AXP's balance sheet looks strong with ample cash. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends."", 'Zacks Rank #2 American Express has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.4% and 14.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.6% over the last 30 days.', ""International Business Machines Corp. is likely to benefit from the rising demand of its hybrid cloud and AI solutions. Increased watsonx adoption by clients is a tailwind. IBM's collaboration with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry will likely generate incremental revenues. Strong free cash flow generation of IBM provides the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in the evolving business environment."", 'Zacks Rank #2 International Business Machines has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.1% and 4.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.5% over the last 30 days.', 'Microsoft Corp. has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues.

The TV company posted slightly better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, squeaking past revenue estimates and narrowing losses per share."", ""Activate Consulting Founder and CEO Michael Wolf sits down with Yahoo Finance Live in-studio to discuss fuboTV's relative position in the virtual cable space, touching on its plans to block the joint sports bundling venture from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Fox (FOX, FOXA), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)."", '""But even that partnership, it\'s expected that their package... [will be] somewhere between $40 to $50 a month,"" Wolf says. ""So, yes, that\'s a threat to them, but a great deal more of the threat is they\'re not just competing against Disney and those three companies — they\'re competing against Comcast and charter and other big operators.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", ""- We're going to continue on media streaming because FuboTV reporting fourth quarter earnings ahead of the open, beating on revenue and revealing a new record for paid subscribers in North America. That stock, though, down today, getting crushed to start the year. Down about 40% here. For more on FuboTV's earnings and the streaming landscape, we're going to bring in Activate Consulting Founder and CEO Michael Wolf. Michael, thank you so much for being here with us."", 'MICHAEL WOLF: Great to be here.', '- As I mentioned, some of the top line numbers, good. But a miss on revenue and subscribers for 2024 for the guidance there. What do you think about that miss? And what do you think is the biggest contributor to that?', ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, you basically have to pull back and recognize that what Fubo is, it's a virtual pay-TV operator, virtual cable. And if you look at the business, we have about 8 million people in-- I'm sorry, 18 million people in the US households that are getting virtual cable."", ""But Fubo is the smallest. You've got 8 million from YouTube TV. You've got another 4.6 million from Hulu. And you've got some others, including Dish. So this is relatively small. They have 1.6 million subscribers in the US and another 400,000. And they've lost but-- they've lost almost 2/3 of their market value in just the last two years, even though they've doubled their income in the last two years."", '- So what is the future then look like for a Fubo? Does it get acquired by someone else? Or what happens?', ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, at an enterprise value of roughly $700 million, it's going to be very valuable to somebody else. It's unlikely this company they keep losing money. Last year, they lost over $400 million in revenue."", ""So the other issue is that as much as they've started off marketing themselves as a sports service, they cost at $80 for their basic package. They cost just as much as you have in cable. And there's not a lot of difference between what you're going to get on FuboTV."", 'Now they have a great Latin package I can tell you that my kids have a lot more fun watching soccer in Spanish than a Latin package is only $32. But-- so it comes down to their position in the market, their financials, and then ultimately how much it costs for somebody to buy the service.', '- You talked about the struggles, though, in terms of the market cap for the company. To what extent is that related to that joint venture between ESPN, Fox, and WBD?', ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, it's been going in this direction. And there is a reason it's down to 8% for the day, which is that investors are very concerned. And the fact that the CEO of the company has had some very-- he's pulled no punches, a very choice words for-- we're talking about the partnership between Disney, Fox, and Warner Discovery."", ""And so-- but that-- even that partnership, it's expected that their package-- they haven't publicized anything but somewhere between $40 to $50 a month. And so yes, that's a threat to them. But a great deal more of the threat is they're not just competing against Disney and those three companies. They're competing against Comcast and Charter and other big operators."", ""- Let's sort of pull back even further, right, and just look at the streaming landscape overall because it feels confusing right now. It feels confusing for viewers. It feels confusing for investors in terms of all the offerings that are out there. And now they're doing the bundles. And so, you know, who do you think sort of comes out on top when all of that is said and done?"", ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, first of all, they all keep saying they were going to finally make money and cut their losses. And they really don't have a choice but to continue to produce. And so we've got Netflix is going to continue to produce programming. Amazon is huge in comparison. And yes, it starts off being confusing with the subscriber. How do you know what show is on what network or what streaming service?"", ""So we have a couple of streaming services that are really here to stay. And it's Netflix. And Disney does have a bundle of Hulu and ESPN+ and Disney+. What's fascinating is we're already seeing the rebundling of-- in the same way we had cable. So Verizon just announced a service where they'll give you both Max and Netflix for 10 bucks a month. So we're going to see the rebundling. Still all of our research shows that the average American home is going to subscribe to at least five services."", '- Really?', '- Wow.', ""MICHAEL WOLF: They'll churn them. And that, by the way, is on top of the free services like Tubi and Pluto that they're going to be using."", '- I mean, it sounds a lot like cable, right?', ""MICHAEL WOLF: It certainly does where-- and as soon as we get more live programming on these services-- and then what's next is news.

It sort of decays very steeply and then flattens over time. The more months you\'re paying for the service, you\'re less likely to cancel.

That's the most cancellations in five years. But roughly a quarter of customers resubscribe within three months of cancelling their subscription, according to an Antenna report."", ""For a deeper dive on the study, we are joined by Brendan Brady. He is Antenna strategy director. Brendan, this is a fascinating study. It answers many of the questions we've had about these streaming sites. So let's talk first about the cancellations that these sites saw."", ""How much of that is about customers becoming a little more cost conscious? How much of this is about just the sheer number of services that are out there, customers just can't keep up?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: I think it's the latter more than anything. there's. More choice than ever in terms of where you can access premium film and television content. There's also no switching costs associated with streaming. You can cancel a service in one, two, maybe three clicks."", ""And so we're seeing the consumer become more habituated to moving of in and out of these services. And that's been the primary driver of this increase in churn that we've seen as of late."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. We're talking about cancellations. But what your study also found that a lot of those customers do come back. So let's talk about the churn. How quickly is that churn happening right now? And who's most affected by it?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: So if we look at the consumer behavior around re-subscription, which is a core metric of ours here at Antenna, it's really on the rise, the behavior, overall, of canceling a service first, but then also adding it back."", ""And so if we look at the nine biggest streaming services in the US, 25% of customers are coming back within three months after canceling. Fast forward to 12 months, and it's about 40% of customers."", 'We see that Peacock and Netflix, actually, in this past year, saw the highest instance of winning back those customers at a quick rate. And I think a lot of it is driven by content. So maybe you subscribe to Peacock to watch ""Sunday Night Football,"" when the season kicks off. And then when the season ends, you might cancel, but you come back.', 'And we really see that the consumer is getting increasingly comfortable with moving in and out of these services with a lot more rigor.', ""AKIKO FUJITA: And Brendan, any sense on what some of those shows are or those offerings are that bring the consumers back, at least, brought them back, if you're looking at 2023 data?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: I think it's hard to say a specific title, just given that everyone has different tastes. But, overall, we certainly do see that the consumer will cancel, but then they'll also come back. And the implication there is that services now have to begin to manage these customers, not only over a single lifetime, but, really, think about their relationship with that platform more holistically."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: What's interesting to me, though, even though we're talking about re-subscriptions or re-subscribers, however you want to use the term, it is still also, for these brands or platforms, all about getting the new subscribers on board to, at least, lock them in to these services."", ""What did your study find about how that strategy is working? That three-month window you talk about to me is so fascinating, because have to wonder what the calculation is among those customers who've signed up to say, is this something that's worth keeping?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: So if you take a cohort of consumers, and you see how they decay or cancel over time, it's not linear. It decays very steeply. And then flattens over time. The more months that you're paying for the service, you're less likely to cancel."", ""And so that month zero to month three window is super fragile and important for these services to really win that customer. And what we've found is that there's a high amount of subscriptions held in those early tenure periods. If you look at the nine biggest services, 39% of subscriptions that we measure are in their first year of tenure."", ""And if you remove Netflix from that calculation, it goes up to 45%. So nearly half of subscriptions are in their first year of tenure. And that's really when you're most at risk to cancel. And so it's really important for these services to consider, who is that subscriber? What else are they paying for? What else are they watching? And really try to manage them so that they can get them past that fragile period and more towards the area of the survival curve, where things start to flatten out."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Brendan, what's the threshold for the average customer? Is it three platforms, three subscriptions, four subscriptions? What did you find?"", ""BRENDAN BRADY: I can't give an absolute number. But if we look at it broadly, we see that the subscriptions per subscriber is consistently growing. At the same time, churn is increasing."", ""And so maybe you have three subscriptions in a given month. And the next month, you have two. or the next month, you have one. And maybe, the next month after that, you have five. We're in a world where there's virtually no switching costs associated with this, which is quite unlike cable, where you had to call someone, they would have to pick up your box, and so on."", 'And so we really see that the consumer is adding services strongly, but also canceling services with the same amount of strength.']"

Which alternative will win? Possibly all of them.', 'Back in 2018, Anheuser-Busch placed an initial order for up to 800 Nikola fuel cell trucks. Ever so slowly, that is becoming a reality.', 'After numerous missteps and setbacks, Nikola produced 42 hydrogen-powered fuel cell trucks in the last three months of 2023. Of 35 delivered to dealers, most customers ordered them in ones and twos. The $450,000 trucks qualify for $240,000 vouchers from the state of California.', 'Longtime Nikola supporter Biagi Brothers took 10 for operations in Southern California. It hopes to apply some of its remaining 10 vouchers to add five or six more by the end of the year.', '“We wanted to get in on the incentive funds,” Gregg Stumbaugh, Biagi corporate equipment director, told me. “With the $240,000 grants from California, the truck ends up being cheaper than a diesel.”', '', 'Biagi is a longtime third-party dedicated freight hauler for Anheuser-Busch with 90-100 Class 8 day cabs serving the beverage maker.', 'The 10 Nikola fuel cell trucks each haul 9,000 pounds of empty beer cans . They travel 145 miles from Ontario, California, to Anheuser-Busch’s Van Nuys production facility several times a day.

We have to be selective on what applications we use it for,” Stumbaugh said.', 'Biagi helped test the road worthiness during development of the Nikola fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). It ran two-truck pilots in 2022 and 2023. They have plenty of oomph. But the roughly 25,000-pound weight of the tractor, a 13,000-pound trailer and 9,000 pounds of empties is enough for now. A typical load of beer weighs in at 47,000 pounds. The math doesn’t work.', '“Two things have to happen,” Stumbaugh said. “The truck has to get lighter or the weight allowance has to go up to at least 85,000 pounds.” Since neither is likely soon, the beer loads will move on the 22 diesel trucks Biagi deploys out of Van Nuys.', 'The Nikola FCEV production units replaced some of Biagi’s 16-18 compressed natural gas (CNG) powered trucks. They have been switched to other uses.', 'Biagi is quoting an order of 10 trucks with regular production of\xa0 the Cummins X15N natural gas engine by midyear.

CNG fuel costs less than diesel. When renewable natural gas (RNG) made from dairy waste and other organic matter is used, the emissions profile can result in negative net carbon emissions.', 'RNG infrastructure is growing. Clean Energy Fuels Corp. is opening two new fueling stations. One is near Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. The other in south Dallas is close to Interstates 45, 35 and 20 adjacent to dozens of distribution centers. Clean Energy has more than 600 RNG fueling stations.', 'Cummins projects a fivefold increase in the take rate for its X15N big bore engine. It is capable of 400-500 horsepower and 1,450-1,850 pound feet of torque. It expects to make 3,000 X15N engines this year. The company sees a potential 10% penetration of the Class 8 market compared to a historical take rate of 1% to 2%.', '“This is an engine that has been used over a million miles in China already,” Bippus said. “So this is a technology that’s advanced, that’s mature. And when you look at today’s heavy-duty truck fleet, 97% of all heavy-duty trucks going down the road today are still diesel. So when you talk about 10% of a 300,000-to-350,000-unit market, it’s quite significant for us.”', 'Hexagon is building a 113,000-square-foot addition to its plant in Salisbury, North Carolina, where it will make CNG tanks, augmenting production in Lincoln, Nebraska.', 'For marketing purposes, Cummins on Thursday rebranded its next-generation fuel-agnostic B6.7, X10 and X15 engines as HELM, a loose acronym for Higher Efficiency.

Two runs require about 220 miles of driving range, easily accomplished by its Class 8 Freightliner eCascadia and Volvo VNR Electrics.', 'Its battery-electric fleet collectively has accumulated more than 2 million miles, eliminating the equivalent of 307,692 gallons of diesel fuel while avoiding 3,415 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.', 'NFI and Schneider received significant incentives for 50 trucks each from the Joint Electric Truck Scaling Initiative, which received $27 million in funding from the California Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission. Schneider opened a smaller electric depot in El Monte in June.', 'The NFI installation eventually will use 7 megawatts of electricity to direct-charge as many as 38 trucks at a time at up to 350 kilowatts.

But a miss on revenue and subscribers for 2024 for the guidance there. What do you think about that miss? And what do you think is the biggest contributor to that?', ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, you basically have to pull back and recognize that what Fubo is, it's a virtual pay-TV operator, virtual cable. And if you look at the business, we have about 8 million people in-- I'm sorry, 18 million people in the US households that are getting virtual cable."", ""But Fubo is the smallest. You've got 8 million from YouTube TV. You've got another 4.6 million from Hulu. And you've got some others, including Dish. So this is relatively small. They have 1.6 million subscribers in the US and another 400,000. And they've lost but-- they've lost almost 2/3 of their market value in just the last two years, even though they've doubled their income in the last two years."", '- So what is the future then look like for a Fubo? Does it get acquired by someone else? Or what happens?', ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, at an enterprise value of roughly $700 million, it's going to be very valuable to somebody else. It's unlikely this company they keep losing money. Last year, they lost over $400 million in revenue."", ""So the other issue is that as much as they've started off marketing themselves as a sports service, they cost at $80 for their basic package. They cost just as much as you have in cable. And there's not a lot of difference between what you're going to get on FuboTV."", 'Now they have a great Latin package I can tell you that my kids have a lot more fun watching soccer in Spanish than a Latin package is only $32. But-- so it comes down to their position in the market, their financials, and then ultimately how much it costs for somebody to buy the service.', '- You talked about the struggles, though, in terms of the market cap for the company. To what extent is that related to that joint venture between ESPN, Fox, and WBD?', ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, it's been going in this direction. And there is a reason it's down to 8% for the day, which is that investors are very concerned. And the fact that the CEO of the company has had some very-- he's pulled no punches, a very choice words for-- we're talking about the partnership between Disney, Fox, and Warner Discovery."", ""And so-- but that-- even that partnership, it's expected that their package-- they haven't publicized anything but somewhere between $40 to $50 a month. And so yes, that's a threat to them. But a great deal more of the threat is they're not just competing against Disney and those three companies. They're competing against Comcast and Charter and other big operators."", ""- Let's sort of pull back even further, right, and just look at the streaming landscape overall because it feels confusing right now. It feels confusing for viewers. It feels confusing for investors in terms of all the offerings that are out there. And now they're doing the bundles. And so, you know, who do you think sort of comes out on top when all of that is said and done?"", ""MICHAEL WOLF: Well, first of all, they all keep saying they were going to finally make money and cut their losses. And they really don't have a choice but to continue to produce. And so we've got Netflix is going to continue to produce programming. Amazon is huge in comparison. And yes, it starts off being confusing with the subscriber. How do you know what show is on what network or what streaming service?"", ""So we have a couple of streaming services that are really here to stay. And it's Netflix. And Disney does have a bundle of Hulu and ESPN+ and Disney+. What's fascinating is we're already seeing the rebundling of-- in the same way we had cable. So Verizon just announced a service where they'll give you both Max and Netflix for 10 bucks a month. So we're going to see the rebundling. Still all of our research shows that the average American home is going to subscribe to at least five services."", '- Really?', '- Wow.', ""MICHAEL WOLF: They'll churn them.

Let's take a closer look at the things to watch in the month ahead."", ""Disney theme parks have turned to festivals as a way to drum up more than just turnstile clicks. Disney World's Epcot kicked off the International Flower & Garden Festival on Wednesday. The park's second-most popular event will run through Memorial Day. The Disneyland Food and Wine Festival kicks off at Disney California Adventure this weekend, running through April 22."", ""It's a money machine for Disney shareholders. Guests may enjoy the festivals for their event-specific displays and activities, and the bump in turnstile clicks is naturally appreciated for any gated attraction. However, it's ultimately a way for the House of Mouse to sell unique food, beverage, and merchandise items."", ""Spring Break is a busy time at Disney's stateside theme parks, and it's challenging to slap a hard timeline on the school holiday season because different states and counties schedule their weeklong springtime breaks at various times through March and April. It's still something investors and theme park visitors will want to keep in mind this time of year."", ""March 8 is when Disney World's Osceola County students get released. Neighboring Orange County -- with nearly 4 times the population -- gets out the following week. Parochial schools will get out closer to the Easter holiday that takes place at the end of the month. Most of the Disneyland school districts will be taking their breaks in the second half of March or the first week of April."", ""Things will be quiet for Disney at the local multiplex until May, but it doesn't mean that its namesake streaming service won't turn heads. Disney surprised investors -- and delighted Taylor Swift fans -- by announcing at its fiscal first-quarter earnings call that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour would be streaming exclusively on Disney+ starting on March 15."", ""Swift's concert film topped $180 million in domestic ticket sales in the fall of last year, shattering records for theatrical releases of musical events. It's a big score for Disney, along the lines of the Hamilton musical it landed in the summer of 2020."", ""Disney naturally has a robust content catalog with its own franchises, but it doesn't hurt when a leading entertainment stock expands its appeal to a new audience. It will be that much harder to cancel Disney+ if you have a Tay-Tay fan in your home.

A consumer defensive stock, Costco has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well.The discount retailer's key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers.This outlook reflects Costco's ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales and register high membership renewal rates. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see solid upside.(You can read the full research report on Costco here >>>)Shares of Walt Disney have outperformed the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +1.2%). The company's first-quarter fiscal 2024 results reflect a solid revival in international theme park and resort businesses. Recent attractions like the Frozen theme land at Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Park in Paris, as well as the Zootopia theme land at Shanghai Disney, are expected to boost the prospects of the theme park business.Disney's declining ad revenues, due to fewer impressions, has been a headwind for some time now.

You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by the aforementioned Jim Gillies. Jim, thanks for being here."", ""Jim Gillies: Thanks, Ricky for that intro. Let's indeed ask me those questions."", ""Ricky Mulvey: The story this morning that is unavoidable is the Capital One wants Discover. There will be questions among US regulators because headlines are acting like this is a done deal. Let's set the terms out first though. It's a $35 billion all-stock deal. The combo would surpass JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup by credit card volume according to Bloomberg. First and foremost, why does Capital One want this business?"", ""Jim Gillies: Well, they want it. The famous or infamous word, I guess would be scale. Discover is the smallest of the four US major global payment networks, so they're about to get bigger. They want to leverage the investments, they being Capital One, leverages the investments and their network they've put down for the last decades, and they can do that by getting larger very quickly with as you say an all-stock deal. They are claiming and you should always look at these claims with a very healthy shaker of salt, let's put it that way. They're claiming there will be strong returns on invested capital, post-deal synergies totaling about $2.7 billion, I think, through 2027, or it'll take until 2027 to fully realize that. But I think the Empire building is a thing, Ricky, and this is Capital One taking the next step on building their position to challenge the folks, as you mentioned, like JPMorgan and Citigroup."", ""Ricky Mulvey: But the shareholders of Capital One aren't too happy about it, even with these advertised synergies and scale building, they're going to get access to essentially a payment network that they didn't have before, where they had to go out to Visa and MasterCard to get their credit cards out there, and yet they don't seem too happy about it."", ""Jim Gillies: Well, last I saw it was down what one or 2%, Capital One. They're reacting a little bit, or some people are reacting and say, we want to get out of the way of this. I think that's a little silly. Capital One is not richly valued right now. Frankly, I think let's put, it looks pretty decent. I think Discovery is also similarly reasonably valued. Stock Advisor Canada has a recommendation on Discover Financial, for example, and the analyst covering that, Buck Hartzell, is very enthused about the company. I don't think he's terribly thrilled about it going away. It's a scale building, these types of acquisitions do happen all the time, which I suppose is a nice little softball to you to ask about regulatory issues."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's do it."", 'Jim Gillies: There you go.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Usually you do a softball question, not a softball answer for a softball question. But all the headlines are making this sound like it's a done deal from what I've read this morning, and then there's a little bottom paragraph where it's like it still has some regulatory hurdles to clear. There's a lot of big mergers that have been falling apart lately, and it seems like those watching this story, those invested in Discover, like Buck Hartzell, maybe he still has some hope that this could be a stand-alone company."", ""Jim Gillies: On the subject of regulatory approvals or not, look in a world where Amazon buying iRobot can fall apart because of regulatory concerns, admittedly, that was the European Union who were saying, Amazon's going to delist all their rival vacuum folks on their platform and that will hurt iRobot, which is a little silly. But whatever. I have to think that Capital One and Discover who jointly released the press release today, the CEO of Discover is widely quoted in the press release. Three members of the Discover Financial board are going to be joining Capital One board. I would like to think basic due diligence has had both parties run this up the flagpole in terms of legal and probably regulatory expert folks. Now, my take on this is look, again, Discover is the smallest of the big four. Visa, MasterCard, Amex, all much larger than Discover. On the banking side, which is more where Capital One is held."", ""Capital One is like number 10 in the US in terms of total deposits, Discover is at 26. The deal will move them to about number six in the US after of course, the big four, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and I think US Bank is number five. This would move them up to number six, but they'd still be one-third in terms of deposit base. They'd be one-third the size of Citigroup and Wells Fargo, less than one-third, actually. If you prevent this on an anti-competitive basis, you're sending a second message."", ""The second message is the big four are all that matter, and we will block anyone coming to any semblance of scale with the big four. I think that actually would send a worst method. Now it doesn't mean that it won't get regulatory scrutiny, and they might have to hive off one or two things to make it sure. But I think it's not the same, obviously, but Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard, where there was some concerns about that going on there. I think this will take longer than is expected, but I think it will ultimately get done. But that two bucks buys you coffee down the street. What do I know?"", 'Ricky Mulvey: Two bucks at the Capital One cafe.', 'Jim Gillies: There you go.', ""Ricky Mulvey: You get a coffee and do your banking. Let's go to Home Depot earnings. On Friday, JMo made Home Depot radar stock. He said he was going to be curious about the inflationary story, not much of an inflationary story on the call. In fact we have disinflation, which was interestingly brought up. I think it has to do with lumber, but why is disinflation a problem for Home Depot right now?"", ""Jim Gillies: I don't think it is. Disinflation is just a slowing of the rate of inflation. It's not deflation. Disinflation is arguably what we've been doing for the past two years, trying to slow the rate of inflation. That's why we've hiked, we being the federal banks of both of our countries, hiking rates. I don't think it's that much of a problem. I think these companies like Home Depot have seen all manner of economic environments before. I think the long-term investor just looks at this and doesn't particularly care. Investing is an expectations game, and expectations, they were already set, they were going to be light. They've been light for the last year. They'd be light again this year. But you knew they were going to be light. I think I am going to go in a bit of a sermon here. I know, act shocked. Home Depot is probably one of my favorite, if not my favorite case study for a company that transitions from growth mode to cash-cow. No one noticed."", ""They noticed, but 16 years ago now. In fiscal 2008, which their fiscal year is ending in February, it's always weird. This is a company that had been in major growth mode. They've been growing their store base by somewhat like 8% a year or somewhat like that before that and 2008, they only did about two-and-a-half billion, $2.2 billion in free cash flow in that last year of growth mode, and their store count was like just over $2,200, and their capex was $3.6 billion, which is actually higher than what the most recent is. Today, the store count has gone nowhere. I think they've grown at 0.3% annually for the last 16 years, but cash flow has exploded. Home Depot is a story of a dominant company in, effectively, an oligopoly. Lowes, you can argue it's an oligopoly. Yes, there's mom-and-pop hardware stores everywhere, but whatever."", ""They've turned into cash flow mode, and the cash flow exploded. The last 16 years since they went from rapid store growth, plow all their cash flow into growing the store count to, we're just going to do maintenance, very slow growth that they're calling for 12 stores this year. They're probably going to close a couple as well, so net store growth probably won't be 12. They have produced $143 billion in free cash flow for the past 16 years. They have thrown all of it at share buybacks, which has reduced the share count by 41%, and ever-rising dividends, they've just jacked their dividend to nine dollars a share for this coming year. When they stopped their major growth trajectory, like I said in 2008, they were at $0.90 a share. They've 10-folded their dividend."", ""On a dividend-adjusted basis over the past 16 years, Home Depot, mature giant cash-cow company, has given investors 20% annualized returns. Please tell me again, though, I know there's a bunch of growth-focused investors who like to say, when this happens, it's a sign of a company maturing and all the good stuff has gone. It's been about 16 years, 20% annualized. I'm picking a straw man, obviously. But please tell me how much better the new growth changing the world has done over the 20% annualized put up for the past 16 years at poky no-growth Home Depot, who still has their competitive position unchanged by the way. I go on, I'll wait."", ""Ricky Mulvey: They offered. I want to meet this straw man who's ready to go to town on Home Depot."", ""Jim Gillies: I can give you a name or two, but we'll talk after the show."", ""Ricky Mulvey: What you just described is why Home Depot is able to essentially offer a soft forecast and the stock does not flinch. That's always the story. Earnings beat expectations, stock forecast is down and then the stock gets pummeled. Let's go to Griffon Corp, which is a story you haven't heard. It's not going to be in the headline of today's show. But we're Slacking this morning, and I offer up some stories, you give some takes on it. You wanted to talk about, and I'm quoting now, a maker of fine residential and commercial garage roll-up doors in garden rakes run by a well-comped, in-depth artistic management team."", 'Jim Gillies: Guilty as charged.', 'Ricky Mulvey: I was like, we can talk about some other things, but I feel like Jim wants to talk about this story. This is an activist story, seems like the activist plays worked out. Give us the story with Griffon Corp here.', ""Jim Gillies: Sure. Yes, Griffon Corp is that very thing. They are well-comped. One of the reasons why the activist Voss Capital showed up a couple of years ago is, do you see what these guys are getting paid basically? They pointed to a myriad of compensation plans that seem to basically need a pulse, and they'd be met in full. In fact, the pulse might be optional on a couple of them. They pointed out Voss Capital, that is pointed out that the CEO, who is a gentleman, Rob Kramer. I believe his name is the CEO and Chairman that he made more for this tiny little company. I think today it's barely a four billion dollar company. Again, they make roll-up doors, garage doors, garden rakes, garden hose. They own the Hunter Douglas fan, the old ceiling fan brand. That guy made more than the CEOs of some other companies you've heard of one, we've already talked about Home Depot, Starbucks, and Disney."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Old Bobby? Your favorite entertainment CEO, Bob Iger?', ""Jim Gillies: I was going to say, I'm going to hold off on the Bob Iger love [laughs] right now. They said the board was compromised, was full of cronies. I came to the story about a year into the activist fight. They already had one fight and they were calling for a division to be sold off. I recommended it in Hidden Gems Canada in January of 2023, and I think one market day later, they announced the deal with the activist because I was gearing up for another fight and I love a lot of good activist fight. They announced that the head of Voss Capital, who'd already got one of their directors onto the board anyway, in the previous fight, they were announcing that the the lead for Voss Capital was himself joining the board, and they announced the standstill agreement."", ""We're all going to work together and kumbaya, and we're going to bring it everything together. We're going to create shareholder value for people. They sold off the previous division, but they were in the middle of a strategic review. That strategic review disappointed everyone except apparently me when it came out a couple of months later because everyone is expecting a sale of the company. Instead, it came out that, we're going to give you two dollars a share, special dividend, and we're going to up our buyback program. Stock promptly fell from the mid 30s to the mid 20s, very nice time to add by the way. But since then they've paid that special dividend, they've hiked the regular dividend twice. They have indeed been very aggressive in operational improvements that has led to more cash flow and that cash flow is lead to better buybacks, a little bit of debt repayment."", ""They got serious about board refreshment, so they actually got rid of a couple of the directors who had been there for forever and ever. The reason I call them nepotistic as the CEO is the son-in-law of the former CEO who himself was the son of the former CEO before him. I'm not scared by that kind of stuff because frankly, I think when you have people so nakedly looking out for their own self-interest, maybe who view to align yourself with their self-interest. But the thing that came out this morning that I think is kind of the end of the activist story. So why Griffon is going forward, is going to have to earn its place in your portfolio based on performance alone, is the word came out that Voss Capital is selling 1.5 million shares to Griffon themselves at a 3% discount to the market. So that's nice, I like that. But this will take their holdings from about 2.8-2.9 million shares down by 1.5 million."", ""It'll take them below the 5% threshold where you have to report, and the lead of Voss Capital is leaving the board. Now, they gave all the right words and said we're going to keep on owning shares. However, they can now sell without needing to file a form for the rest of their holdings, so it'll be interesting. But this is a stock again, Griffon Corp, maker of garage doors and yard implements. The stock is up. Basically, it's a double over the past year. It's up about 120%, if you did take the conclusion of the strategic review as a buy signal, that's about nine months ago. If I can be said to try anything, it's, I like to preach that you can make market beating returns in odd and weird places. You don't have to go for whatever is super-hyped in in the media at this time. You can find it in Home Depot as we talked about. You can find it in people who sell stuff to Home Depot, like Griffon Corp. So I thought it was an interesting story that most Motley Fool Money listeners probably haven't heard of."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Well. I think we just hit the SMCI story with that as well, so we're about out of time, Jim Gillies.

The Valentine's day is over and it's time for a little heartbreak. This time, Jason and Bill shared the ones that got away."", ""Alison Southwick: Last week, Jason Moser and Bill Mann joined us in a studio to talk about the great loves of their life, by which we mean, of course, investing in stocks. But you know what, that was last week. This week, it's time to talk about the heartbreak of investing. You guys ready, I've tissues nearby if you need them."", 'Bill Mann: Valentines is over, back to cynicism. Here we go.', ""Jason Moser: We're going to power through."", 'Alison Southwick: Here we go. So our first question today is to talk about the one that got away, by which we mean a stock that you never got around to buying and wish you had.', ""Jason Moser: Yeah, there are a lot. There a lot that I can put on this list. My recency bias is going to bring Nvidia here front and center. I'll go with Nvidia because it's funny. One of my roles here, I'm the advisor for Augmented Reality and Beyond service, and when i started that service almost five years ago, Nvidia was one of the stocks I recommended. They made a lot of sense at the time and I remember digging into the company thinking, these guys are coming around and doing a lot of cool stuff. This is a stock I really probably want to own. As I mentioned before on the previous episode, we have internal trading guidelines that make it a little bit tricky sometimes for us, just people transact whenever we want."", ""So it was just never a stock that was open. It was never available for me to actually go in there and purchase, so I didn't at the time it sort of left my mind and never thought about it. Five years later, it's up like 2,000%. Now, I'm thrilled that I've got it on the card for our members because our members have clearly one big from Nvidia. That's one where I looked back and I think, man, I should've just kept that on my radar and I just didn't catch it. I wish, I did because I feel like they still got a lot to do."", ""Robert Brokamp: I'll just add a little bit about the training guidelines for people who are curious. That is, once The Motley Fool has recommended or discuss the stock, we are as employees prevented from buying it for I don't know what it is 10 days or something like that. Then also if you own it and you want to sell it, you have to check and see if we've mentioned it, recommend you can't sell it. It does limit a little bit of the investment flexibility of working here."", ""Alison Southwick: Bill, how about for you? What's the one that got away?"", ""Bill Mann: I read this assignment as something that I had recommended for members and had never gotten around to buying myself, and the answer was a company that I loved the moment that I recommended it and never went back and bought it. It was a company called TransDigm, which since that point in time, and I looked this up and it was painful to do so it's up 4,500%."", 'Robert Brokamp: Oh, goodness gracious.', ""Bill Mann: TransDigm, what they do is they make basically all of the parts inside of an airplane tube. The tube itself is Boeing or Airbus, but all of the components inside are built by other companies. By other companies, I basically mean TransDigm. They did almost everything else inside Boeing planes. It turns out when you sell those sorts of things that works out really well, and I thought it was going to work out really, really well, and it has worked out really really well for a lot of people who are not me because I didn't buy it."", ""Alison Southwick: Do you feel it's too late to ask them out?"", ""Bill Mann: It's water under the bridge at this point. It's felt expensive for the entire time and for the entire time that's been wrong. Maybe."", ""Alison Southwick: It's not in your league now maybe. What about NVIDIA? Is it too late? Can you call out to Nvidia and be like"", ""Jason Moser: Not too late as far as the business goes now. The valuation is one where I feel like, I'm going to be patient here. I'm going to be patient and let it come back to me. If she comes back to me. [laughs]"", ""Bill Mann: You're talking about the Taylor Swift of stocks, right now my friend"", ""Alison Southwick: She's moving on."", ""Bill Mann: She's on TV and you're not."", 'Alison Southwick: Next question. Tom, we actually covered this a bit last week, but tell us about the one that broke your heart by which I mean, a stock that you bought and it just went nowhere.', ""Jason Moser: This one's funny for me because it's one that really did well for a while until it just didn't. That's Under Armour. Under Armour is one that had?"", 'Bill Mann: I dated Under Armour too.', ""Jason Moser: So much potential. We saw that stretch of time where Kevin Plank really seemed to have the answer for everything and then they just hit a wall and it was self-inflicted errors. I mean, he just made some strategic blunders. I think that really sent the company into a not a death spiral, but certainly something that's been very difficult for them to recover from. Thankfully it was a smaller position. It's not something that was naturally material to my portfolio. It was one where I was considering, maybe this is one we need to keep building this out. This could be the next Nike-like story until it became apparent that it probably wasn't going to be so. To be clear, I still own those shares today. It's a small, meaningless position, but I was telling you before about I default and not selling. The funny thing is, I think Under Armour makes great stuff, I'm wearing Under Armour pants. I mean, I love them. They just can't get that business in order. It's really interesting to watch. I remember before Bill, how we would talk about Lululemon versus Under Armour. I mean, all of these."", ""Bill Mann: Nobody's talking about that anymore."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. It's just, it's fascinating to see how well Lululemon's performed while watching Under Armour just completely flounder. It's been a real lesson."", ""Alison Southwick: What's been a difference you think?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, I think certainly just vision and leadership. Leadership with Under Armour, they've just never had any kind of consistent vision as to what they wanted to do with the business and recovering from those strategic blunders that Plank made long ago and most of that was in regards to supply chain management. It's just been a difficult road for him."", ""Bill Mann: I'm still completely distracted by the fact that you used the word brodie. [laughs]"", 'Robert Brokamp: To the max even, to the max. [laughs]', ""Bill Mann: Yeah. I think it's meaningful that off the top of your head know exactly the name of the founder of Under Armour and don't know the founder of Lululemon. They have a much more professional management."", 'Jason Moser: Was that Chip Wilson?', 'Bill Mann: Yeah.', 'Jason Moser: Now Wilson is out of the picture.', 'Alison Southwick: Wilson was a bit problematic.', 'Robert Brokamp: Arguably controversial.', ""Jason Moser: I'll argue a little bit out there. I don't know that much about him, but it was very clear that there were like, look we got to part ways and get this thing back on track. Under Armour has not had that luxury because Plank is still the majority owner of that business. Split those shares out. He's controlling the whole thing. I mean, I think we could argue that's a bad move and clearly investors have loss from that."", ""Bill Mann: I'm not suggesting that Wilson was the one that got away by the way. [laughs] I am simply saying that they had a professional management team and structure in place whereas with Under Armour, Kevin Plank's basically up their Napoleon style pointing here, we go there. If you're going to be a Napoleon, you'd better bring it and he hasn't."", ""Alison Southwick: What's the stock that broke your heart, Bill?"", ""Bill Mann: Mine's Kahoot."", 'Alison Southwick: Kahoot?', 'Bill Mann: You know Kahoot. The little Kahoots, the quizzes that basically?', 'Alison Southwick: Yeah, I know Kahoot.', 'Bill Mann: Got your kids 80% of the learning they did during the pandemic.', 'Alison Southwick: Yeah, the little quizzes.', ""Bill Mann: It was a great little company and we recommended it almost when it was pre-revenue. They were building up their business, didn't even have a marketing team. It was all word of mouth and just exploding. It was one of those companies that simply and I wouldn't take the other side of this, I wouldn't want the other experience, but it was one of those companies that really took hold during the pandemic and then lost its grip on the other side. Again, I don't wish we were still in the pandemic so that Kahoot would be doing well, but it's such a company with a purpose that I really wanted it to financially succeed more than it has."", ""Alison Southwick: Our last question is for you all. Now, this was the one that got Jason squirming in his seats, so we'll see if if it's true. The one time you cheated, by which we mean an investment that generally goes against your principles or what you've recommended to readers and listeners here."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, I think the reason why I squirm is because I look at these tickers and I'm like, yeah, they're not working out and yet I still own them and I don't know why. Oftentimes, I own them because, I either I'm holding out hope that things will turn around, or they serve as living lessons and reminders. I think in this case these are reminders. One of the rules I tend to espouse, and I follow it for the most part but every once in a while I stray, is to just not buy into IPOs, give it some time. I like to see four quarters of reporting. I want to understand how this management team works. What they're focused on, how they report, metrics."", ""Every once in a while I do stray and two that standout, I'll give you two here, Eventbrite and Unity Software, a couple of companies that I bought into early on in their public lives. They just struck me as interesting businesses with a lot of potential. I didn't worry so much about the valuations and the enthusiasm behind this stuff. Because with IPOs, that can often be a drawback as the enthusiasm that's there pushes those valuations up a little bit irrationally. Especially so in the case of Unity Software, given the time that it went public, but Eventbrite and Unity stand out to me as two where I should've listened to myself. I didn't. Maybe things will get better for them, but I'm not terribly optimistic at this point."", 'Alison Southwick: Bill, how about you?', ""Bill Mann: I have a basic rule and it is this, don't leave your money at risk of dictators."", ""Alison Southwick: We're getting back to Napoleon again."", ""Bill Mann: We are getting back to Napoleon again. I have a second rule and it is if the person who is running a company seems like a bad person, they are probably a bad person. I had recommended a company called JD.com, which is a Chinese company. It's a very interesting company, a clone of Amazon. Their CEO got in trouble with the law in a very bad way in Minnesota in I think 2019."", 'Alison Southwick: What was he doing in Minnesota?', 'Bill Mann: Getting in trouble.', 'Alison Southwick: You can get in that much trouble in Minnesota?', 'Robert Brokamp: Yeah. I went to a seminary in Minnesota and I had to storage.', ""Bill Mann: I don't know how to respond to that. But go on."", 'Alison Southwick: We will save that for another episode.', ""Jason Moser: You've left him speechless."", ""Bill Mann: Was arrested for messing around with a woman who was not his wife. You know what I mean? I found myself a little bit frozen by what do I do because we as analysts are supposed to focus on a business and you don't want to overreact to things, but you don't want to under-react to them either. In this case, given everything else about what was happening in China, the fact that it's not a particularly friendly environment to foreign capital, I should have just pulled the plug and just got out and said, listen, this is not a place where we need to risk our money. We have thousands of companies that we can invest in. Why would we remain exposed to this one?"", ""Alison Southwick: Let's close on a more optimistic note."", ""Bill Mann: Thank you. I really didn't want that to be the end."", ""Alison Southwick: No, we are going to close on an optimistic note here. Moser and Bill, is there any stock right now that you're maybe slipping notes to in-class and do you like me? Yes, no, maybe? Maybe a stock on your radar?"", ""Robert Brokamp: Of course, if you talk about it, then you can't buy it."", 'Bill Mann: What have I already mentioned?', ""Jason Moser: Well, I so yes, there is one that, I've recommended it in my Next-Gen Supercycle service and it's performed very well in a very short period of time. It's a company called Samsara and ultimately in connected Cloud operation, helping businesses connect all of their devices and vehicles and buildings and stuff like that. Samsara builds that technology, runs all the software behind it. The ticker is IOT, which is clever because of Internet of Things and all of that stuff, so it's an Internet of things kind of play. Speaking evaluation, the stock has taken off. The valuation is one where I'm like, it needs to come back to me before I can really start getting serious about those love letters. We're going from the notes to love letters. That's what I'm hoping. But that's one that I continue to really be be interested in."", 'Alison Southwick: IOT. Bill, how about you?', ""Bill Mann: Jason talks about all this technology. I'd like to talk shoes for a minute."", ""Jason Moser: We all got to wear shoes, I guess we don't all have to. We're all doing."", ""Bill Mann: We're all requested to wear shoes lots of times. Not that long ago, I was in Japan and was walking in a very fashionable part of Tokyo. There were all these little boutiques and one had a line going around the block. As an investor, that's the thing that makes me go, huh. The company was On Holdings, the running shoe company. No, they call themselves a movement company."", 'Alison Southwick: How do you spell that, O-N?', ""Bill Mann: Yeah, ON. The people will have heard of this even if you have not. It is a Swiss company co-invested by Roger Federer. The guy who founded it was a former triathlete who noticed that other triathletes were suffering from the same exact injuries and decided to try and develop a shoe that would be safer for people. They're fantastically comfortable. They very fetchingly called their technology Cloud technology, which is a great sounding thing for your feet. They're selling off like wildfire. A little bit of a challenging valuation, but in the very same way that Lululemon has always had a challenging valuation. This is a company that I am making goo-goo faces and the like just to see."", 'Alison Southwick: Eyebrows, eyebrows.', 'Bill Mann: Exactly.', ""Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases."", 'Colgate-Palmolive in Focus', ""Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Consumer Staples sector. The stock has seen a price change of 8.54% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.48 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.22%. In comparison, the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry's yield is 2.34%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.59%."", ""In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 0.5% from last year. Colgate-Palmolive has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 2.88%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Colgate-Palmolive's current payout ratio is 59%, meaning it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Looking at this fiscal year, CL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $3.48 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 7.74%.', 'Bottom Line', ""From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout."", ""High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, CL presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy)."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Strength within the handset business also buoyed the top line. Non-GAAP revenues in the reported quarter were $9,922 million compared with $9,456 million in the year-earlier quarter.', 'Quarterly revenues from Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) were up 7% year over year to $8,423 million, as strength in the automotive platform and higher demand in handsets was partially offset by channel inventory drawdown within the IoT business. The segment’s revenues exceeded our revenue estimates of $8,056.4 million. The company witnessed solid market traction in the EDGE networking business that helps transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets.Automotive revenues rose 31% to $598 million, driven by increased content in new vehicle launches with its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform. This was the 13th consecutive quarter in which Qualcomm recorded double-digit growth in automotive revenues. Handset revenues were up 16% to $6,687 million, primarily led by the increased deployment of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform in new Android flagship launches.

EBT margin for the QCT segment rose to 31% from 28%.Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenues totaled $1,460 million, down 4% year over year due to lower licensing revenues.

Comparisons provided are to the prior year quarter unless otherwise noted."", ""A webcast replay of today's call will be available on the Investors section of the company's website following the call. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Simon."", ""Simon Campion: Thank you, Andrea. We appreciate you all joining us this morning for our Q4 2023 earnings call. Today, I'll begin by providing a summary of our recent performance then Glenn will cover Q4 and full year 2023 financial results and share our 2024 outlook. I will finish by providing a strategic operating update. Now starting on slide 3. We achieved over 2% organic sales growth in 2023, above our projection driven by growth in three of our four segments. The Ortho business saw double-digit growth in both Byte and SureSmile. The EDS segments posted growth in all regions and product categories and in total, delivered mid single-digit growth, while Wellspect Healthcare generated high single-digit growth. Through the fourth quarter, the macro environment remains challenging."", 'The CTS segment declined slightly more than expected, mainly due to equipment and instruments with softness in imaging which we anticipate will continue in 2024. This was partially offset by an increase in demand for CAD/CAM and particularly for intraoral scanners, which was another bright spot for us. In January, we conducted our latest customer survey with over 3,500 respondents from 12 key geographies. Sentiment in the US improved slightly about the future of the industry and their practices. German and Australian customers continue to express a negative outlook, and this is largely unchanged from the last quarter. The survey also suggested that patient demand in China continues at reduced levels but with no sequential deterioration. EBITDA margin for 2023 came in at 17.4% and adjusted EPS was $1.83, both in line with our guidance.', 'As we stated at the beginning of the year, we consider 2023 a transition year for Dentsply Sirona. We promptly and decisively executed several critical transformation initiatives to achieve the necessary cost savings, enabling strategic reinvestment for hygiene and growth. We made significant progress on these initiatives, which have strengthened the foundation of the business and set us on a path to improved future performance, which we highlighted for you at our Investor Day in November. As we have said, we believe 2024 will be an inflection year for us, delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth, largely due to the benefits of our transformation initiatives. We remain laser-focused on executing our strategy while simultaneously strengthening our foundation, developing new capabilities and implementing greater discipline and rigor across our business.', ""Moving to slide 4, I would like to share some selected business highlights. In 2023, we continue to bring innovation to the market. We enhanced our DS Core offering expanding the platform and enabling new clinical functionality. On the last earnings call, I shared that we had already exceeded our DS Core target for 2023. And as an update, we ended the year with over 14,000 unique accounts. We believe that DS Core will play an ever-expanding role in shaping dentistry as the industry undergoes a digital evolution that's connecting technology and clinical workflows. We are also focusing on digital print materials and we recently launched Lucitone for Primeprint and expanded our splint suffering. We believe we are well positioned to advance digital print materials and continue to see opportunities to accelerate the adoption of 3D printing in dental practices, as a stand-alone office capability or as a complement to in-office milling."", 'As previously communicated, we reinvigorated our focus on clinical education offerings. We know the digital dentistry requires hands-on in-person training to facilitate practice integration and unlock the potential of digital tools, and we are committed to providing this for our customers. In 2023, we were proud to offer over 9,200 training and education courses globally through live, online and hybrid formats, which reflects about a 30% increase compared to prior year. We also expanded our reach with digital learning platforms through a partnership with DTI that started in the fourth quarter. Live events play an important role in enriching our clinical education platform. Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to attend our second DS World event in Dubai.', 'This event featured courses on mainly dental disciplines with over 1,000 participants in attendance, and this is the first of several DS World events we have planned this year. In the fourth quarter, we also conducted several implants focused events in the US and Europe. Building on the success of these events, we look forward to hosting our Implant Solutions World Summit in Miami in the second quarter. We continue to progress our sustainability strategy. In 2023, we achieved a new record for our injury and illness prevention rate. The safety of our employees is of the utmost importance, and we are very proud of this accomplishment. Our Wellspect Healthcare business also continues to lead in this area and recently won an award for sustainable MedTech innovation for the use of renewable plastic in LoFric Elle, a female urinary catheter.', 'We were also named to Sustainalytics 2024 ESG top-rated companies list earlier this month. Wrapping up the highlights, we recently announced an expansion of our collaboration with A-dec, introducing a new integrated product offering that will bring together Primescan Connect and certain A-dec delivery systems. This builds upon our existing collaboration with A-dec that integrated Cavitron into their platform. The new offering creates a fresh solution to meet customer needs, empowering dental professionals to streamline practice workflows and elevate the patient experience. And with that, I will hand the call over to Glenn for the financial update.', ""Glenn Coleman: Thanks, Simon. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I'll cover several topics, including our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, as well as our outlook for 2024. Let's begin on slide 5. Our fourth quarter revenue was $1.01 billion, representing reported sales growth of 2.9% and organic sales growth of 1.9%. Foreign currency positively impacted sales by approximately $10 million or 100 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis, the key highlights in the quarter included strong sales performance in China, which grew over 35%, double-digit growth in both Wellspect and Implants and Prosthetics and high single-digit growth in our global aligners business."", 'Despite higher sales, EBITDA margins declined 40 basis points in the quarter, mainly due to year-over-year decline in gross margins, which contracted 100 basis points. This was largely driven by unfavorable country mix due to lower-margin implant sales in China and unfavorable product mix within our endo and CAD/CAM portfolios. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.44, down 4% from the prior year, largely due to lower gross margins and a higher tax rate. In the fourth quarter, we generated $160 million of operating cash flow, up 13% year-over-year, driven by improved inventory management and the timing of accounts payable compared to the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 128% compared to 110% in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $150 million of stock at an average price of $30.73 and paid $30 million in dividends.', ""For the full year, we returned $416 million to shareholders. Let's now turn to fourth quarter segment performance on slide 6. Starting with the Essential Dental Solutions segment, which includes endo, resto and preventive products, Organic sales grew 3.4%, driven by growth in all three regions and in each product category. EDS benefited from stable patient traffic and price increases implemented earlier in the year. Shifting to the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment, organic sales grew 10.6%. Aligners grew high single digits. Specifically, SureSmile grew 13% and continues to benefit from market share gains, new product offerings and differentiated outcomes. Additionally, we believe the recent launch of our SureSmile simulator within DS Core will benefit future sales."", 'Our direct-to-consumer aligner brand Byte grew 6% despite a constrained financing environment. With the recent uptick in new customer interest, we are ramping our investment in treatment planning, clinical support and sales, which supports our anticipated greater than 20% growth in Byte this year. We also expect SureSmile to grow double digits in 2024. Moving to Implants and Prosthetics. Double-digit growth was a clear bright spot in the quarter driven by VBP and market share gains in China and higher demand in Europe. Globally, premium and value implants saw similar growth rates. Our US implants business was down slightly in the quarter, but showed less of a decline than previous quarters, and we anticipate a return to growth in 2024. Wrapping up our dental performance, CTS, our Connected Technology Solutions segment saw organic sales declined 8.3% versus the prior year quarter.', ""Our global CAD/CAM business grew low single digits, driven by increased demand in the US, while the Equipment & Instruments business declined double digits in the quarter. Moving to Wellspect Healthcare. Organic sales grew 16.9%, driven by growth in Europe and the US. As a reminder, Wellspect had an easier comp, as the prior year quarter was impacted by a onetime pricing matter in Italy. In addition, new product launches contributed to better-than-expected year-over-year growth. Now, let's turn to slide 7 to discuss fourth quarter financial performance by region. US sales declined 1.2% due to lower sales of equipment instruments and implants, partially offset by strong growth in aligners and CAD/CAM equipment. US CAD/CAM distributor inventory levels decreased sequentially in the quarter by approximately $4 million and ended the year essentially flat compared to the end of 2022."", 'Relative to historical averages, distributor inventory levels remain low. Turning to Europe. The region returned to growth in the quarter with contributions from Wellspect, EDS and OIS. SureSmile grew over 25% with notable growth in Spain, France and Germany. We also saw an increase in implants demand driven by growth in MIS and higher conversions from our legacy product, XiVE, to our new DS OmniTaper implant. Our CTS segment continued to see lower volumes due to recessionary impacts, particularly in Germany, which is the largest market in the region. Excluding Germany, Europe organic sales grew 4.1% compared to the prior year. Rest of World organic sales grew 5.4% in the quarter, led by China, which delivered significant growth in implants.', ""In 2023, we saw a more than 40% increase in our China implants customer base. The public and private sector both continue to experience significant market growth. Sales in Japan declined during the quarter, as the prior year quarter benefited from government rebate programs on certain equipment. Wrapping up Q4 regional performance. Latin America grew high single digits in the quarter, led by solid demand and sales execution in Brazil and Mexico. We saw an improvement in Interoil scanner volume, driven by the launch of Primescan Connect and sales of refurbished Omnicam units in the region. In the first half 2024, we plan to launch SureSmile, DS Core and Primeprint in Brazil and other countries within the region. Now, let's turn to slide 8 to briefly cover our full year 2023 performance."", 'Sales for the full year were $3.97 billion, representing reported sales growth of 1.1% and organic sales growth of 2.2%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 110 basis points due to a stronger dollar versus most major currencies. Key highlights for the year included double-digit growth in aligners and high single-digit growth in China due primarily to significantly higher volume in implants, which more than offset the pricing declines associated with VBP. The largest challenge we saw in 2023 was lower volumes in equipment and instruments, which we attribute to recessionary concerns and higher interest rates in the US, Germany and other developed markets as well as competitive pressure and we see this trend continuing into 2024.', 'EBITDA margins contracted 210 basis points to 17.4% due to cost inflation and higher investments in the commercial organization, clinical education and infrastructure, partially offset by restructuring benefits. EBITDA margins were in line with our guidance and adjusted EPS of $1.83 was at the midpoint of our range. Operating cash flow was $377 million, down 27% year-over-year, driven by higher investments, restructuring cash outlays and unfavorable timing of accounts receivable and accounts payable. Free cash flow conversion was 58% compared to 81% in 2022. As we mentioned during our recent Investor Day in November, our long-term goal is to achieve 100% free cash flow conversion on a consistent basis once we move past the cash outlays associated with our transformation initiatives.', ""The company continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and finished the year with $334 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.6 times, which is slightly above our long-term targeted rate of 2.5 times due to the fourth quarter $150 million share buyback. Today, we also announced a 14% increase to our dividend. This marks our fourth consecutive year of double-digit increases to the dividend and demonstrates our confidence in our long-term plan. With that, let's move to slide 9 to discuss our expectations for 2024. For 2024, we expect organic sales to be flat to up 1.5%, which represents a net sales range of $3.96 billion to $4.02 billion. We expect FX to be a slight headwind to reported sales based on current rates and anticipate stronger organic sales growth in the second half of the year as we remain cautious on the macroeconomic backdrop for the next several quarters, particularly for equipment."", 'We expect our EBITDA margin to be greater than 18% in 2024, an expansion of approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. We also expect margin improvement as we progress through the year based on the timing of investments and restructuring savings. We project an increase in our full-year tax rate due to geographic income mix and expect the Q1 tax rate to be higher than the full year as we finalize our 2024 tax planning initiatives. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.10. For Q1, we expect organic sales to be roughly flat to the prior year, with slightly lower reported sales due to an anticipated FX headwind of approximately $10 million. On a sequential basis, gross margin is projected to improve in Q1. With this, we expect EPS will be up mid-single digits year-over-year.', ""In Q1, we expect to see growth in OIS and Wellspect Healthcare, offset by declines in EDS due to a tougher comp and CTS based on current trends. Let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss the puts and takes in our 2024 adjusted EPS outlook. Organic growth at the midpoint is expected to contribute $0.04 to earnings. Our projected cost savings from the restructuring plan should reach the run rate of $200 million in 2024. Net of investments, we expect this will contribute approximately $0.13 of EPS. The investments for 2024 include ERP expenses, Byte and SureSmile expansion. We expect net investment hedges will be a $0.07 tailwind to EPS, consistent with our previous comments at our November Investor Day. We are forecasting that other items, namely cost inflation, tax and share count will net to a $0.02 headwind to EPS."", 'These drivers combined to adjusted EPS outlook of $2.05 at the midpoint of the range, up double-digits versus the prior year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Simon.', 'Simon Campion: Thank you, Glenn. Moving on to our strategic update, starting on Slide 11. Our strategy is clear and remains unchanged. Digitalized dentistry deliver customer-centric innovation in products and services for oral health and continence care, serve our partners effectively and accomplish these goals through a dedicated and engaged team with compliance and quality always at the core. We continue to actively implement and advance all five of our strategies with strengthening execution discipline, continued process improvements and the strategic investments we are making in the company, we believe we can advance the performance of this company and create increased value for our stakeholders and employees. Now moving to Slide 12, let me discuss our foundational initiatives.', ""During 2023, we established many of the fundamental elements necessary to purposely carry out our plans for 2024 and beyond to transform this company across product lines, regions and operational areas. With the restructuring program largely complete and on track to deliver $200 million in savings this year, we are shifting focus to the foundational initiatives we have prioritized for 2024. We spoke about these at our Investor Day in November, and we continue to make progress on each of them. Let's start with supply chain transformation. Our supply chain is overly complex, and we know we have significant opportunities to improve it. In 2023, we announced the closure of three manufacturing sites and consolidated two distribution centers into one."", 'These actions set into motion our efforts to unlock value in our manufacturing and distribution network. To pursue this goal, we kicked off an extensive network analysis to guide our execution road map. Spearheaded by a dedicated and cross-functional team of experts, we expect this global initiative will yield significant results, including enhanced operational efficiency, improved footprint and lower costs. We expect to begin to realize financial benefits in 2025, continuing into 2026 and beyond. Simplifying our supply chain is closely intertwined with our SKU optimization initiative. By streamlining our portfolio and utilizing a robust product life cycle management process, we can improve and simplify our supply chain and reduce sustaining engineering costs.', 'In 2024, we expect to execute on the first wave of the SKU optimization program, addressing 60% of the SKUs in the endo and resto portfolios. We are taking a thoughtful approach to this work to drive our cost and improve working capital, while maintaining revenue and ensuring a positive customer experience. We expect to begin delivering benefits from the first wave towards the end of 2024, and we also plan to evaluate further opportunities. Our ERP modernization initiative will upgrade, improve and standardize our ERP systems. The new system will unlock organizational capacity, enhance efficiencies in our network and pave the way for future automation opportunities company-wide. We are conducting rigorous systems, testing and ensuring organizational readiness as we prepare for the phased deployment approach.', 'We have targeted our initial rollout for mid-2024, and we are confident in our ability to execute this program with minimal disruption. Of course, as we advance these three foundational initiatives, we remain steadfast in upholding compliance and quality as key guiding principles. We plan to deliver on our promises in a manner that aligns with our values with success gauged by our ability to generate value for our stakeholders over the long-term. Now moving to our final slide, I would like to reinforce a key few points. First, with focused execution, we delivered on our 2023 guidance. While end markets remain challenging, our strategy is clear and our execution has improved and will continue to do so. Second, we have established our foundational initiatives and strategic objectives.', ""We are significantly better positioned to deliver on our goals for the work that's been completed or is well underway. Third, we are poised to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2024, much of which we expect to derive from our transformational actions. Fourth, we remain confident in the path to our targeted $3 of adjusted EPS in 2026. We've established the roadmap to reach our goals and are fully focused on execution, which we believe positions us well for improved performance in 2024 and beyond. And with that, let's now open it up for questions.

Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today, I'm going to provide an overview of our 2023 performance, share some key observations from my first four months as CEO, and lay out our plan for the year ahead.P10 delivered strong fourth-quarter and full-year operating results in 2023, which demonstrated the strength of our strategies and our position as a leading specialized private market solutions platform. In 2023, we generated double-digit top-line growth and strong profitability. For the full year, fee-paying AUM increased by 10%, revenues increased by 22%, and adjusted EBITDA rose by 16%.It bears repeating P10 surpassed its two-year gross fundraising expectations of $5 million six months early. And by the end of 2023, we had raised an incremental $2 billion above our original target.Despite the underlying strength of our platform and our positive financial results since going public in 2021, we continue to face pressure on our valuation. Across most metrics, we trade at a meaningful discount to our alternatives peer group. While we believe this presents a compelling entry point for investors, today, we are focused on closing that relative valuation gap through strategic execution underscored by transparent communication. We believe that as we articulate and execute on our new strategic initiatives, the market will take notice and reward shareholders.When we talk about our ownership base, it's important to note that P10 employees make up the largest ownership position in our shareholder register. This is a reflection of our collective conviction in the intrinsic value of our platform. We are firm believers that this ownership stake results and strong alignment between the company and our broader shareholder base.During the fourth quarter, we bought back 859,600 shares at an average share price of $9.74. Further, our Board of Directors has approved a CAD40 million expansion of P. ten's current share repurchase program with $10.6 million remaining on our previous 20 million buyback authorization. We now have over 50 million available for repurchases. We have never been more confident in the franchise and its future and are evaluating every possible avenue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Since being appointed CEO in October, I have had the opportunity to holistically engage in almost every aspect of TEN's operations that has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the organization. It was important for me to get to know our teams and equally as critical for them to get exposure to me. I spent the last two months of 2023 on a listening tour across a broad array of important constituencies, visiting with them in person hearing their perspectives and gaining insights as to what P10 does well and learning how we can continue to enhance the organization and its processes.In addition to visiting with each of our strategies in person and engaging with our employees. I had the privilege to spend time with many of our clients and limited partners, both current and prospective as well as our investors and analysts with the benefit of that insight, I can say with confidence that 10 is a world-class business made up of the leading minds in the middle market, alternative investment space. Moreover, our managers all have a world-class track record of investing excellence that has resulted in high levels of trust with our LPs. Trust is not something we can buy or create in the short term, I take that trust very seriously, and we plan to build on the immense credibility our managers have achieved in this next chapter of our growth. The solid foundation that has been built to date will form the basis of our success going forward.As we look to 2024 and beyond, our strategic priorities are as follows. First, institutionalize our platform and optimize our corporate level organizational structure.Second, drive increased organic growth by expanding our existing client franchise through programmatic cross selling and strategic partnerships. Third, implement a robust disciplined and process-driven approach to inorganic growth. Fourth, generate operational efficiencies through incentivizing collaboration and leveraging data insights, and finally, enhance our shareholder communications with an eye to greater visibility and transparency. These priorities set the stage for an exciting 2024 as we invest to accelerate profitable growth in 2025 and beyond. We have aggressive goals with a roadmap to achieve them executing on our plan will not occur overnight, but progress will be evident as we report each quarter. We also plan to share more about our long-term strategy at P. ten's first Investor Day in the fall of this year. As I said at the beginning of the call, P. 10 employees are firmly aligned with our shareholder base when we execute on this strategy, all P. 10 stakeholders benefit.Now let's dive a bit deeper on each of our priorities. First, we are going to institutionalize our platform and optimize our corporate level organizational structure in a trust and Performance business. Our people are our greatest assets, and we must set up an appropriate structure to drive success and accountability in this next phase of our growth. With that in mind, I would like to thank our retiring Chief Operating Officer, Frits Souder for his contributions to P10. He was a founding partner at RCP and has done an outstanding job for our limited partners, our shareholders and our employees. We thank Fritz for all he has done and wish him the very best, our go-forward corporate level organizational structure has four key functional areas. Each led by a senior executive vice president level leader reporting directly to me, our outstanding EVP, CFO and CCO, Amanda Kosan's will continue to lead the finance, audit, accounting, legal and compliance teams. Amanda's contributions to P10 cannot be overstated as she has helped build the strong financial and compliance functions that have positioned P10 for continued organic and inorganic growth. To further augment our legal and compliance framework. She will lead the external search to identify and recruit General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer to further enhance our P. 10 control framework. Mark Hood has been elevated to the role of EVP of Operations and Chief Administrative Officer. In this newly created role, Mark will oversee our operations, data and technology human resources, public relations and communications, and he will continue in his oversight of our Investor Relations function. Marc has been foundational to P. 10 since its IPO, and I'm incredibly excited about his expanded role.Next, I'm thrilled to report that we have hired a world-class professional to serve as our EVP, Head of Strategy and M&A. RJ. Jensen is an incredibly talented seasoned professional with over 20 years of experience at Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities and Perella Weinberg Partners. Rj will oversee our corporate strategy and lead our corporate development and M&A activities inorganic growth will be a core growth driver for P. 10 RG. will be instrumental in building a scalable M&A blueprint, identifying key strategic opportunities for P. 10 and executing on M&A transactions. Additionally, we are going to continue to invest in our client franchise to lead this effort. We are seeking an experienced industry veteran. This person will oversee our client organization including client relationships, distribution, marketing and product development. And we'll work closely with client leaders across our various strategies as we scale the platform, we're going to build a best-in-class distribution network for our products across strategies. We strongly believe the head of distribution will be critical to maximizing value of each client relationship. Given the importance of finding the right person for this role. We have retained a leading recruiting firm with deep expertise in this area, and we are working closely with them in earnest to find the right leader for this function.Second we plan to drive increased organic growth by expanding our existing client franchise through programmatic cross selling and strategic partnerships. Pten is fortunate to have a large and growing global LP base and we need a scalable and replicable process for expanding our influence with current and prospective LPs. Our new Head of Distribution will be responsible for building this framework to demonstrate progress against our goals. We intend to provide additional details on this topic throughout 2024, culminating at P. ten's inaugural Investor Day this fall.Third, we are implementing a robust disciplined and process driven approach to inorganic growth. My background is in deal-making and in alternative asset management. I've spent decades doing those two things at the highest level and strongly believe that we are positioned to execute deals on a global scale. We plan to increase our footprint, which will also enhance our relationship network. This will mean navigating new jurisdictions and regulations and that's where we're going to be selective, but opportunistic in this pursuit as our Head of M&A, RJ Jensen will leverage his vast experience to reaccelerate our M&A engine.Fourth, we plan to drive operational efficiencies through incentivizing collaboration and leveraging data insights. As we focus on accelerated growth in 2025, we need to ensure our operational structure is optimized and designed to encourage efficiency and collaboration across our strategies. We also plan to share more data with the investment community in a format more aligned to our peers. We will communicate how we are leveraging the collective strengths of our platform more regularly.Finally, we plan to meaningfully enhance our shareholder communications with an eye to greater visibility and transparency. I believe that in order to assess the progress we are making against these previous four initiatives. The investment community has a clear and understandable framework through which to evaluate P ten's performance, both on an absolute and a relative basis. As such, we are going to begin rolling out KPI.s that allow our key stakeholders to get their arms around the huge opportunity. We're capitalizing on we will have more to report in future quarters as we work through specific details with our audit partners and Audit Committee, and we look forward to updating you appropriately.Now let's turn to our outlook for 2024. Starting with fee-paying AUM, we anticipate we will organically raise more than 2.5 billion of gross new assets across the platform. We expect double digit revenue growth. That is driven both by this fundraising activity as well as positive fee rate dynamics. We also hope that in 2024, we will announce at least one strategic transaction. As it relates to adjusted EBITDA margin, we expect margins to average in the mid 40s, excluding the effect of acquisitions. There are two dynamics at play here that I'd like to highlight. First is an ongoing mix shift within our existing portfolio of strategies. As we have previously noted, some of our newer and faster-growing businesses such as Bon Accord Park and WTI. have lower core adjusted EBITDA margins than other parts of our business, and the overall margin will continue to reflect this evolution.Second influence on margins is the critical and foundational human capital investments we are making in the business. We expect these investments to drive core growth and provide a high ROI for investors as we move into the new year, we will begin using the common descriptor FRE. or fee-related earnings in our financial reporting.Before I hand the call over to Amanda, I want to acknowledge some of the recent noise in the marketplace regarding a previously disclosed related party transaction with crossroads in step with enhanced transparency, we want to speak directly and clearly on this matter. The transaction was reviewed, approved and disclosed in keeping with the appropriate governance controls Peter has in place P. 10 did not invest any capital in Crossroads institutional investors who did invest in Crossroads did so on a non-discretionary basis and conducted their own rigorous due diligence. The transition of our founders and former co-CEOs had absolutely nothing to do with the related party transaction. Robert Albert and Clarke Webb will continue in their current roles as Executive Chairman and Executive Vice Chairman respectively.Finally, the Committee of our independent directors commissioned Wilkie FAR and Gallagher, a third party law firm to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the transaction. The committee, the broader board and the law firm all found our governance provisions were properly followed To close, I want to remind shareholders that the fundamentals of P. ten's business remain exceptionally strong. While we view this year as a table setting a year ahead of acceleration in 2025 and beyond. We are a world-class platform that has momentum across world-class strategies. We are committed to transparency and delivering our investors transparent disclosure.With that, I'll turn the call over to Amanda to further review our financial results."", 'Amanda Coussens', ""Thank you, Luke. And the fourth quarter fee-paying assets under management were 23.3 billion, a 10% increase on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, $860 million of fundraising and capital deployment was offset by 297 million and step-downs in exploration in the first half of 2024, we estimate 1.2 billion and step-downs in explorations. For the second half of 2024, we estimate an additional 300 million revenue in the fourth quarter was 63.1 million, an 8% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. Year over year, revenue increased from 198.4 million to $241.7 million, up 22%. Average fee rate in the fourth quarter was 109 basis points driven by higher fee rates, direct strategies becoming a larger part of our fee-paying AUM.Before I continue with our results, I'd like to provide insight into a one-time event that impacted the performance of our venture equity strategy TruBridge in the fourth quarter. If not for this event, we would have recognized an additional 3.1 billion of revenue and 2.7 million of adjusted EBITDA to bridge global premier one or TGP. one was raised in 2022 with the objective of investing and all funds raised by an undisclosed managers, global platform across key vintages, 2022 and 2024, 2025, ClearBridge closed TGP. one with a total of 275 million of external LP capital, $250 million. We were confident of deploying and $25 million for reserves. CGP. only charge management fees on the $250 million at a 1% rate. PGP. one deployed just under 40% of its total fund size and the 2022 advantages with the remaining 60% planned for 2024, 2025 vintages and reserves in late 2023, the undisclosed MANAGER announced it would be separating a global platform by spinning out its India and China operations into their own independent firms. The TGP. one mandate did not allow investments in these new independent firms. As a result, we recommended that LPs vote to release all TGP. one LPs from their uninvested capital, and we distributed a consent election to that effect. The management fee from inception will be revised based on this new smaller fund size. In addition to preserve goodwill with our limited partners, we have waived 50% of the recalculated management fee from inception, June 2022 December 2023.Turning now to our other strategies. In the quarter, we had 12 funds in the market and saw broad participation across our platform. Our private equity strategies raised and deployed 324 million in our venture equity strategy, raised 299 million. Our credit sleeve raised and deployed 209 million for impacting contributed 28 million. Pten continues to benefit from strategies with long track records of generating durable alpha and offering best-in-class investment opportunities to our global investors.Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were 57.7 million, a 10% increase over the same period a year ago. For the full year 2023, operating expenses were $220.8 million, a 43% increase over 2022. The increase was primarily driven by additional compensation benefits and noncash stock-based compensation expense related to the acquisition as tire BioAccord, hark and WTI. GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter was 1.9 million, a 139% decrease when compared to the year ago period. On a year-over-year basis, GAAP net income decreased from $29.4 million to a net loss of $7.8 million. Gaap net loss is primarily attributable to compensation expense and noncash stock-based compensation related to the CEO transition and the acquisitions of Bon Accord Hart and WTI. adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 30.7 million in line with 30.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year, adjusted EBITDA grew from 106.8 million to $123.6 million, a 16% increase for the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.7%, and for the full year, it was 51.1% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted net income or ANI was $25.5 million, a 7% decrease over the $27.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year, A. and I. increased from $97.9 million to 102 million, equaling a 4% increase fully diluted ANI EPS on a year-over-year basis grew 2% to $0.82 per share. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter were 30.5 million. At December 31st, 2023. We had an outstanding debt balance of $292.6 million and 71.8 million available on the revolver. As of today, we have 273.6 million in outstanding debt was 90.8 million available on the credit facility. We also continue to pay our quarterly dividend for Class A. and Class B common stock. We have declared a dividend of three and a quarter cents per share payable on March 26th, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 11th, 2024.Finally, as of December 31st, 2023 our Class A. shares outstanding were 57,622,895, and Class B shares outstanding were 58,474,267. Thank you for your time today, and we look forward to building strong momentum in 2024 as we seek to accelerate growth in 2025.I'll now pass the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)Michael Cyprys, Morgan Stanley.', 'Michael Cyprys', 'Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Luca, hoping to come back to your commentary on the listening tour is hoping you might be able to elaborate on some of the key takeaways that you had from your listening tour over the past couple of months. Curious what stood out what areas could you enhance the organization in terms of processes? And as you think about accelerating growth, what do you see some of the key levers to pull? Where do you are you looking to lean in and invest more as you look out over the next couple of years for for P-type thinking?', 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Thanks, Michael. Appreciate the question. So I would say, as I mentioned in the script. I think from the listening to a perspective, the first and most compelling thing that came away almost universally was the incredible strength of our investing franchises and the incredible kind of talent that we have in every one of our investing strategies. That was first and foremost.The second thing I would say was kind of the trust and confidence that LPs have and continue to place in us and our ability to continue to drive and grow that LP base is really compelling.And the third, I would say is the broad-based desire and alignment across our organization to do the foundational work that we've talked about here. And obviously with the hope that the end result in that will be a meaningful uplift in our share price over time, as we talked about and sort of the dimunition or the elimination, frankly, at that discount that we've had relative to the peers and so as we think about the growth perspective, right, just sort of fundamentally, there are two main areas where we want to drive fundamental growth. One is organic. And as I mentioned we're going to be leaning in hard in terms of being able to do that in a more comprehensive way. And we really need kind of a foundational leader to work with me to help us do that. And so as I mentioned, we're out aggressively looking and recruiting for a head of marketing, a head of distribution that's going to help us drive that. And then I think from there probably will continue to evaluate how we do that in the best most impactful and highest ROI way. But I think really having a key leader in that effort is foundational and critical. And then you heard me talk about inorganically, how we really want to drive the machine and really kind of live up to the promise that we made at the time of the IPO that we would do the right appropriate value-enhancing strategic deals. And I'll just say I have a background in that I'm thrilled that we were able to recruit a world-class talent like RJ to help with that. And I think collectively, we're going to drive that. And then I think the third place we're going to continue to look is just across the breadth of our platform. Obviously, we have the benefit of scale breadth and we want to leverage those economies and we want to use that in a way that's sort of enhancing for each of our individual strategies and also for the P. 10 platform as a whole. But those are kind of my high-level takeaways. And those are kind of the high-level things, as I mentioned on the call that we're going to do to really invest to reaccelerate growth."", 'Michael Cyprys', ""Great, thanks. And just a follow-up question on fundraising, I think you mentioned $2.5 billion expectation for fundraising here in 24. Just hoping you could help unpack some of the key contributors for that what are you expecting in terms of fund scaling at this point? Any sort of contribution at this point from SMA that you're expecting embedded in that 2.5 billion number and then what can we expect in terms of deployment that I imagine would be incremental to that 2.5 relative to current dry powder levels? Thank you."", 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Yes. So all good questions. And so just to give a little more flavor on it, right. We are out in the market with a broad based group of funds this year as we are most years, right? And so we're kind of out with a fund in virtually all of our strategies. I think actually this year in all of our strategies, 15 funds in total some cases, we're raising one large flagship fund. In other cases, we're raising multiple funds targeted across the platform. And I would tell you, although I think it's probably too early to call the turn, I think the dynamic in the marketplace among LPs, it feels a little bit better right now than it probably has over the last couple of years. I think that's both the recognition that there are some attributes of the space we play that are protected and attractive. And probably also just a broader view on, you know that the capital markets generally are doing better. And so that probably leads into kind of a better fundraising environment. But we're really excited about what we're going to be out with. We do think to your specific question that there is really an ability of ours to do kind of broader-based things across the platform and whether that comes to your question in SMA format or otherwise the specific form to be determined. But I think the opportunity to engage more broadly with more LPs in a more diverse way across the P. 10 platform is a big opportunity set for us. It's something we're really orienting ourselves towards. And I think the whole idea of how you measure our success on that, Michael, we're going to be coming back out, as we mentioned with what I would call augmented enhanced KPI.'s so that you and we can measure monitor and track that progress."", 'Michael Cyprys', 'Great. And just any views on the scaling of funds in 24 and views on deployment, which is that incremental potentially to the 2.5?', 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Yes. Look, I would say, look, we always think about opportunities to scale things. And as you know, many of our funds we recognize on uncommitted, but some we recognize on deployed. And so obviously, if we find ourselves in a more robust deployment environment that will create some upside as it might in any scenario?I would say, look, I don't think our orientation to deployment has fundamentally changed, and we are very focused on being smart and opportunistic. And to the extent that there are dislocated opportunities and we see things that we can take advantage of, we're clearly going to lean in on those clearly, some of our strategies are also what I would say somewhat. I'm attuned to the type of market environment we're in, I think about some of our credit strategies. I think of our GP Stakes strategy as clearly things that are a secondary strategy as well as clearly things that are very attractive in terms of the market opportunities we're seeing and in those cases, we're obviously not going to be shy about appropriately deploying capital in a way that generates value for our LPs."", 'Michael Cyprys', 'Great. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Kenneth Worthington, JPMorgan.', 'Kenneth Worthington', 'And hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question on maybe first for Amanda. One on the fee rate fee rate was 1.9 basis points this quarter. I think you mentioned some mix changes influenced the fee rate here given the funds kind of rolling on and rolling off what is sort of the range of fee rate we could likely expect for 2024?', 'Amanda Coussens', ""I believe that the fee rate that we're continuing to guide towards is about 105 basis points.Okay."", 'Kenneth Worthington', 'So so no change here despite the pop-up in the fourth quarter?', 'Amanda Coussens', 'Yes.', 'Kenneth Worthington', ""Okay. And then you mentioned on the 1.5 billion of step-downs in 24. That's not that different than the level of step-downs we saw last year. I think last year was negatively impacted by the step-down of like the the older, the more recent vintage of WTI. So I guess why so large in 24 is this really kind of the right pace for step downs as we look forward into the future."", 'Amanda Coussens', 'And we would expect overall that our step downs will be about 5.3%, which for 2024 versus 7.1% of overall fee-paying AUM for 2023. Could that help kind of explain the difference?', 'Kenneth Worthington', 'Okay. And is 5.3% sort of the right pace generally more or less into perpetuity or is there anything unusual good or bad about the pace in 24?', 'Amanda Coussens', 'No, I believe that is the correct pace going forward, yes.', 'Kenneth Worthington', 'Okay. And then one last one for Luke, so that you started or in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the stock had struggled. I guess this is in part due to the perception of Crossroads by. Can you tell investors to what extent has Crossroads made its way into conversations with your investment customer. So like the customers of RCP and hark and WTI. and sort of the individual managers. Is it just kind of a public shareholder issue? Or is this also kind of coming up in the arm fund raising or relationship conversations you have with your customers and just so I understand the question.', 'Luke Sarsfield', 'You mean has it come up in our dialogue with the underlying LPs of our various strategies? Is that that the gap?', 'Kenneth Worthington', ""That's what I was really trying to say, and I asked it poorly, I know you out there."", 'Luke Sarsfield', ""If I got the point look, I would say, thankfully, in many ways, it really hasn't come up we had, I would say, a couple inquiries around it that we responded to in a way that was very consistent with the way that we've responded to it in other forums including with our public investors. And I think the good news is our LPs have known us for a long time. They put a lot of trust in us. And I think they really know our individual managers and in most cases, have been with us for a long time across multiple years across multiple vintages. And so I think they know that we do world-class business in a world-class way, and they're focused on that. And so I think, again, that's it really has not in large part, Ken and I hope to goodness it stays that way."", 'Amanda Coussens', 'Great.', 'Kenneth Worthington', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Mike Brown, KBW.', 'Michael Brown', ""Thank you for taking my questions. But to expand on the capital allocation strategy here. So I'm trying to parse through the buyback and the M&A commentary. I guess my question would be, how do you get back into the M&A market at your current valuation levels, is that effectively on hold until you start to narrow the discount that you mentioned versus versus peers? And I guess if that's the case, does that mean you'll be leaning on the buybacks more significantly near term? And I guess what would be kind of the right point where you are you feel like your currency is back to a level that some could be more effective for M&A?"", 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Well, let me I'll start if I could, Mike, thanks for the question. I'll start just with on what I would call a broader M&A philosophy, and then I'll turn it over to Amanda to go through sort of how we would think about the capital allocation waterfall. But your question is the right one does our current valuation impact our ability to do M&A? And I would say I think it would in certain instances, but it would not in many other instances, right? And so the good news is 0.1. We have broad and robust access to capital. Equity capital is one part of that. But we have as Amanda went through meaningful access on the revolver. And I think just meaningful credit capacity more broadly, that's untapped at this point. And so that would create our ability to do M&A.I would say the second thing is not all M&A is necessarily going to come at valuations that are going to be somehow prohibitive to us. I suspect or parts of the M&A market given how robust it's gotten in the alternative space, where that would be more of an impediment. But I think we're looking broadly, we're really focused. I think there are places where that would not be the case as much. And we think we will have ability to execute there.I also think it sort of depends on the size of the M&A deal you're looking at, right? And so we may look at larger deals, but we may also look at a string of targeted kind of string of pearls acquisitions that would allow us to really drive incremental value in ways where we wouldn't have to pay into that kind of frothy part of the market. And so I want to be clear, we are really focused on doing M&A, but we're really focused in doing it in the right value ROIC, creating way for our shareholders. We're not going to do something frivolous with our hard-earned capital. We're going to be really disciplined, but we do think there are opportunities out there in the near term, even given where we trade.And with that, I'll turn it to Amanda, just to hit on some of the kind of broader capital allocation point in general, our priorities of capital allocation remain and our priorities for cash flow remain the same."", 'Amanda Coussens', 'First dividends, M&A buyback and then paying down on the revolver to free up capital for future M&A. And as we said, as of today, we have 90.8 million on the revolver available. And given our free cash flow profile, we really are comfortable with a higher leverage ratio than where we sit today as well.', 'Michael Brown', ""Okay, great. Thank you. And then maybe another one for you, Amanda, on the margin outlook, margin came in at 51% for the year. If I heard correctly, you guys are guiding to a mid 40s adjusted EBITDA margin for 2024. So it sounds like a pretty large delta there, and it sounds like you guys are considering maybe some more infrastructure investments. But I was wondering if you could maybe put a little finer point on that delta, what's driving that difference?"", 'Amanda Coussens', ""Yes. It's really it's and there's an ongoing mix shift within our existing portfolio of strategies. Some of our newer and faster-growing businesses such as Bon Accord, Harkin WTI. have a lower core adjusted EBITDA margins than other parts of our business and the overall margin will continue to reflect this evolution. And I would say the second influence on margin is the critical and foundational human capital investments we are making in the business. We expect these investments to drive our core growth and provide a high ROI for our investors. So it's really a mix of those two factors."", 'Michael Brown', ""Is your point at a certain point, as you continue on your growth trajectory where the margin we'll actually begin to inflect higher?"", 'Luke Sarsfield', ""Again, we'll I'd answer it this way, and I'd say it depends right. And it depends on a few things. One is obviously, it would depend on M&A. This little presumes that we're running the platform as it is for the foreseeable future. As we've talked about, we imagine that will probably not be the case. And so anything we did from an M&A perspective would obviously have some impact and largely likely to be at least initially a margin dilutive impact I would say it also then depends on this question of relative growth rates.Right. And so the question then becomes how is that relative growth rate? On the one hand, you want your faster-growing businesses to grow faster and growth is valuable, even if that comes at a relatively but relatively lower, but still high margin versus the wider world and the wider opportunity set. We do think I want to be clear that some of the foundational investments we're making, obviously, they will be most impactful in the 1st year that you make them and then over time you will see the accretive benefit of those investments bearing fruit. The question then will be that accretive benefit relative to the ongoing mix shift that will still be happening on the forward. How does that trade-off?I don't know, frankly today that we have perfect visibility on that. Some of it will depend on the relative growth rates and we're investing to grow everywhere. And so in some places, we're looking to reaccelerate growth. And so look, I would tell you, I think the foundational investments we're making are going to be highly accretive to the franchise, highly ROI, general to the franchise and will help us drive accelerating growth and margin on the forward with some of the offsets I just noted Okay."", 'Michael Brown', 'Great. Thank you for taking my question.', 'Operator', 'Benjamin Budish, Barclays.', 'Benjamin Budish', ""Hi, good evening and thanks for taking the question, I was hoping to revisit the revenue guidance. If we could just want to make sure I kind of have the details. Right?So it sounds like 2.5 billion plus of gross assets, 1.5 billion a step down. So that's about $1 billion of net fee-paying AUM growth with maybe some upside from deployment. So that's like a little less than 10%, but it sounds like if the fee rate in average can be one oh five, can you just kind of maybe explain how the you work out the on the double digit revenue growth.Maybe to start --"", 'Amanda Coussens', ""I'm sorry, Ben, can you repeat the last part of your question, make sure."", 'Benjamin Budish', ""With the with the gross on gross raising of 2.5 and the outflows of 1.5 over the course of the year. It looks like about like a billion from Q4 to Q4 of fee-paying AUM growth. So maybe like a little under 10% in terms of average fee paying AUM growth. And Amanda, you mentioned earlier that the average fee rate should be about the same year over year. So I'm just trying to flip from that, if I have that right to the double digit revenue growth you're expecting?"", 'Amanda Coussens', 'Yes, I think that the difference in SAP. We have some funds in the market that we would expect some larger catch-up fees in 2024.', 'Benjamin Budish', ""Got it. That makes sense. And then any details on in terms of like pace of debt paydown. I think you talked about M&A, obviously being at the top on capital priority. But just thinking about getting from the top line to the bottom line, you've talked about the EBITDA margin."", 'Amanda Coussens', 'So just wondering what the interest rate or interest expense outlook looks like and maybe anything you can share on your expected cash tax rate yes, I would expect our cash tax rate to be very similar to what it has been in 2023. And generally, I would say for interest other than additional M&A I would expect our interest to be a bit lower. Of course, it depends on how much where how much stock buyback we have during the year. But otherwise, yes, the rate would be the only thing ultimately impacting from and stockpile.', 'Benjamin Budish', 'Got it. Okay. Thanks for the clarification. Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'John Campbell, Stephens.', 'John Campbell', ""Hey, guys, good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to the catch-up fees. By my math, I'm sure on maybe a 10 million benefit or so from 2023 to 22. And obviously, that's 500 points or so of growth or 500 bps of growth, a pretty big impact to margins as well.So first I guess, is that math correct.And then secondly, Amanda, you talk to the expectation that it will be a little bit higher. You don't get your fees will be a bit higher than 24. I'm just going to see if that was relative to 2023 or if that's relative to kind of historical averages?"", 'Amanda Coussens', 'So John, yes, you are correct. And the 10 million.

That doesn’t mean Juels, the chief scientist at Chainlink and professor at Cornell Tech, in New York CIty, thinks the world is going off the rails anytime soon. But over the past decade — with the development of large language models that back increasingly powerful artificial intelligence systems and autonomous, self-executing smart contracts — things have begun to trend in a more worrying direction.', 'This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.', 'There is a “growing recognition that the financial system can be a vector of AI escape,” Juels said in an interview with CoinDesk. “If you control money, you can have an impact on the real world.” This doomsday scenario is the jumping point for Juels’ second novel, “The Oracle,” a crime thriller published by heavyweight science fiction imprint Talos, about a NYC-based blockchain researcher enlisted by the U.S. government to thwart a weaponized crypto protocol.', 'Set in the near future, readers might see some familiarities to today. Take the protagonist’s research into smart contracts that can go rogue — and kill — similar to Juel’s own 2015 academic paper about “criminal smart contracts.” Or references to Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov’s famous plaid shirt. Others, like a powerful AI tool that helps computers interact with and interpret the world, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, only came online after Juels started writing.', 'See also: The Man In Plaid', 'Thankfully, fiction sometimes is stranger than reality, and the prospects of smart contracts programmed to kill remain a distant threat, Juels said. He said he remains cautiously optimistic that if people start thinking about the risks today, and design guardrails like blockchain-based oracles (essentially feeder systems for information), it could help prevent problems in the long run.', 'CoinDesk caught up with Juels last week to discuss the burgeoning intersection of blockchain and AI, the ways things can go off the rails and what people over- and under-rate about technology.', 'Are smart contracts like the ones in “The Oracle” possible today?', ""They're not possible with today's infrastructure, but are possible or at least plausible with today's technology."", ""What's your timeline for when something like the events of the book could play out?"", ""It's a little hard to say. At least a few years. What makes them technologically plausible now, when in fact, they weren't at the time I started writing the novel, is the advent of powerful LLM [large language models] because they're needed essentially to adjudicate with what the novel calls a rogue contract. The rogue contract was soliciting a crime, in this case, the death of the hero of the novel, and somehow a determination has to be made as to whether or not the crime occurred and who was responsible for it and should therefore receive a reward."", ""To do those two things, you need something to extract keywords from news articles — basically an LLM plugged into blockchain infrastructure and inheriting the same properties that smart contracts have, namely the fact that they are, at least in principle, unstoppable if they're coded to behave that way."", 'Do you need a blockchain to build smart contracts?', ""It depends on the trust model you're after. In a sense, the answer is no, you could run smart contracts in a centralized system. But then you would lose the benefits of decentralization, namely, resilience to the failure of individual computing devices, censorship-resistance and confidence that the rules aren't going to change out from under you."", 'This may be a weird question, but I figured you might get it: Are blockchains Apollonian?', ""That is a weird question, and I do get it. I would not say blockchains in general, but oracles definitely. As you may know the novel is about not just modern day oracles but also the Oracle of Delphi. They're both aimed to serve as definitive sources of truth, in some sense. One is literally powered by the god Apollo, at least in the belief of the ancient Greeks. And the other is powered by authoritative sources of data like websites. So if you take that perspective, yes, I would say that oracle systems are kind of Apollonian in nature because Apollo was the God of truth."", 'Is blockchain privacy sufficient today?', ""All technology features a double edged sword. There are obviously good and important facets to privacy. You can't have a truly free society without privacy. People's thoughts, at the minimum, need to remain private for people to act freely. But privacy can be abused. Criminal activities can make use of blockchain technology. But I would say that we today don't yet have powerful enough privacy-preserving tools to provide users with the benefits of privacy that I think they deserve."", 'See also: Code Is Not (Always) Law | Opinion', 'Would you say technology as a whole is a generally positive force?', ""There are clear benefits to technology. We've come a very long way toward eradicating global poverty, that's one of the good news stories that people tend to overlook. But there have been costs to the use of new technologies — that becomes visible when you look at the general happiness or contentment of those in rich Western nations, which has stagnated. That can be accounted for as a side effect of technology, in part. There are other factors at play, including a breakdown in social cohesion and feelings of loneliness, but technology has been somewhat responsible for that."", ""One of the reasons I incorporated the ancient Greek dimension [in The Oracle] was that I feel one of the things we're losing as a result of the pervasiveness of technology is a certain sense of awe. The fact that we have the answers to most of the questions we would naturally pose with Google or AI agents at our fingertips means a diminishment of our sense of wonder and mystery with which we used to be encompassed. There's less room for us in our daily lives to explore intellectually. You have to dig deeper, if that makes sense."", ""It's a beautiful idea. The World Wide Web doesn’t contain the sum total of human knowledge, but it is a significant chunk of it. Yet we use it mostly to indulge our base desires."", ""We've been given this incredible gift. And it's surprisingly hard for us to appreciate."", 'What are we overreacting about when it comes to technology?', ""I tend to be somewhat optimistic when it comes to AI doomsday scenarios. I'm by no means a subject matter expert here, but I have studied information security for quite a long period of time. And the analogy I like to draw, and I hope it holds good, is to the Y2K bug. The doomsday scenarios that people envisioned didn't happen. There wasn't a need for manual intervention. We have all of these kinds of hidden circuit breakers in place. And so I feel a certain degree of confidence that those circuit breakers will kick in if, say, an AI agent goes rogue. This provides me at least with a certain degree of comfort and optimism around the future of AI."", ""I've noticed that most of your scholarly writing is normally co-authored. Was it a big shift writing alone?"", ""Yes, it was a huge shift in a number of ways from writing a scholarly paper. One is that when you write a scholarly paper, the language basically has to be dry, otherwise, the paper is likely to be rejected by peers. A funny story about that. In 1999, I co-authored a paper — actually it was the paper that proposed the term proof-of-work [the consensus mechanism behind Bitcoin]. We cited a popular cookbook, “The Joy of Cooking,” because the title of the paper included the word bread pudding and we wanted a reference to explain what it was. A reviewer wanted to reject the paper because he felt this reference wasn't appropriately scholarly. That’s the type of milieu in which you operate in academia."", ""But more importantly, when you're working alone on a project of this type, it gives much freer rein to the imagination. That's one of the nice things about collaborating with other people and one of the reasons I do it — it can help you formulate ideas, but also act as a check on ideas that don't don't work or don't make sense. In the case of fiction, within loose limits, there's no such thing as an idea that doesn't work or doesn't make sense."", 'Do you have any unusual work techniques, coming from someone who teaches in the Ivy League, does research for Chainlink and writes in his spare time?', ""It depends on the set of projects I'm juggling. The thing that was helpful when I was trying to squeeze in time for the book was that I was obsessive about writing it. It was a real flow process. The Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explored the concept of flow, defining it as an activity in which you can maintain a unique focus over an extended period and lose track of time. Writing placed me in a flow state. I squeezed it into the little nooks and crannies of time available to me."", 'Do you think NFTs are overrated or underrated?', ""Bored Apes are overrated. Pointless NFTs are overrated. But the long term future of NFTs is perhaps underrated. In some sense, it's a new artistic medium — the way photography was in the 19th century. Only slowly did people see photography as a real artistic medium. In the long run, I'm actually pretty bullish even though I haven’t been unable to convince my PhD students to work on NFT related projects."", 'Interesting. Does interest in crypto change cohort by cohort?', ""It changes from individual to individual. Like I have some PhD students come in not knowing what they want to work on and I will end up helping them set up a research direction. And others know from day one exactly what they want to do. I have one student about to graduate who knew that he wanted to work on DeFi. That's basically what he's done for five years while working with me. I see the role of a PhD advisor as helping my PhD students accomplish whatever it is they want to accomplish."", 'Anything else you wanted to say about the book?', ""One thing I do want to emphasize, an important message for the community at large, is the growing recognition that the financial system can be a vector of AI escape. People are worried about AI agents escaping from their confines and controlling cyber physical systems like autonomous vehicles, power plants or weapons systems — that's the scenario they have in mind. I think they forget that the financial system, particularly cryptocurrency, is especially well suited to control by AI agents and can itself be an escape vector. If you control money, you can have an impact on the real world, right?"", 'See also: What is Chainlink?', ""The question is how do we deal with AI safety in view of this very particular concern around blockchain systems? The book has actually gotten me and my colleagues at Chainlink thinking about how oracle's act as gatekeepers to this new financial system, and the role they could play in AI safety."", 'Is there anything tangible in mind that Chainlink can do to prevent something like that?', ""This is something I've just started to give thought to, but some of the guardrails that are already present in systems we build like CCIP or cross chain bridges would actually be helpful in the case of an AI escape by establishing boundaries for what a malicious agent could do. That's a starting point. But the question is, do we need things like anomaly detection in place to detect not just rogue human activity but rogue AI activity? It's an important problem, it's actually one I'm starting to devote a fair amount of attention to.""]"

I'm extremely proud of the entire Vertex team. Our employees, focus and commitment underpins our market-leading solutions and customer value. This in turn enabled our strong performance this year. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $154.9 million, up 18.1% year over year. This exceeds the high end of our fourth quarter revenue guidance by $7.9 million. Our adjusted EBITDA was $32 million, up more than 50% compared to last year's fourth quarter. This represents an EBITDA margin of 20.7%, our highest EBITDA margin in over three years. In addition, this quarter ARR exceeded $500 million for the first time in our history, growing nearly 19% to $512.5 million. Nrr was a record 113% up two full percentage points from the third quarter.Average annual revenue per customer increased 19% year over year to nearly $119,000 growth in scales. Customer count was 13% year over year. As a reminder, this number represents our customers with annual revenues greater than $100,000 and demonstrates our ongoing success in the underpenetrated enterprise market NGR was 95% in the fourth quarter within our target best-in-class range of 94% to 96%. Our strong financial results in 2023 were not unexpected. We launched a strategic investment program in 2020 to pursue our vision to accelerate global commerce and fuel our growth to $1 billion in revenue and beyond.Since then, we have broadened our go-to-market team, enhanced our long-standing partnerships with Oracle and SAP while expanding into the Microsoft Net Suite sales force and Workday ecosystems. We accelerated the breadth and depth of our market-leading tax content database. We increased the pace of new product launches by investing in research and development on our cloud platform. We built a customer success team from a standing start that is now a major contributor of our consistent growth in NRR. We completed several technology and tax concept focused acquisitions, and we also built the corporate infrastructure to support a large, more efficient organization.With this investment program largely complete in mid 2023, we saw accelerating revenue growth and strengthening profit margins in the second half of the year, but we believe we are just getting started. This is because most enterprises and large middle market companies are still handling indirect tax with either a wave of spreadsheets, Origin House build software program that was purpose-built when the company was less complex and kept running with the exceptional efforts of a number of in-house programmers, it may come as a surprise, but some of the most recognizable respected and sophisticated companies in the world still handle indirect tax in this fashion for these companies. It's not a matter of if, but when their in-house solution becomes insufficient to manage the business and they need to implement a third party software solution. This decision is most frequently driven by one of three factors. First, business model changes or expansion this could be an adoption of new ways of doing business such as multi channel sales strategies or mergers and acquisitions that necessitate a more scalable approach to indirect taxes.Second audit and reporting requirements demonstrate, but an in-house solution is not delivering sufficiently accurate tax compliant. These situations quickly get the attention of everyone from the tax department to the C-suite and even the Board of Directors to deploy the necessary resources to fix the problem or Third, the Company embarks on a digital transformation or system upgrade to the cloud. In these cases, it's typically not even financially feasible to refactor the homegrown software solution to run in the new environment. We are confident that all three of these tailwinds will drive R-Texas growth for the foreseeable future business changes such as mergers and acquisitions are constant, especially in the market segments where we focus audit pressure is only going to increase as governments grapple with ways to plug spending deficits and deal with the masses amounts of debt that must be serviced.And indirect tax is an important part of this equation as governments generate 3.5 times more revenue from indirect tax and they do from corporate income tax. In addition, increasingly complex rules around digital businesses and marketplaces are driving new reporting and revenue transparency requirements. And we consistently see our ERP. partners driving their customers to move to cloud-based solutions. For example, Oracle is encouraging customers to move to Oracle Cloud as a tease ending mainstream support for ECC. in 2027, prompting customers to migrate to S/4, Hana and businesses are also advancing digital transformation initiatives organically.So to summarize, the fourth quarter results were excellent, but I'm very confident in how our business is positioned for consistent execution in the quarters and years to come.Now turning to notable wins in the quarter, one of the biggest sources of new revenue for Vertex and a sustainable driver of NRR growth. It's increased business with our existing customers. In the fourth quarter, we expanded our relationship with one of our long-standing customers, a large international conglomerate. We have been on a multiyear journey with them as they consolidate and transition their systems to the cloud. The customer increased their usage tiers for their existing subscriptions, expanded their use of VERTEX solutions into additional global markets and license additional products, including chain flow accelerator. This resulted in high six figures of additional recurring revenue for Vertex. It's noteworthy that this company has been a customer for over a decade and uses a wide array of Vertex offerings, including sales tax, consumers, use tax and VAT tax calculation, premium oil and gas content certificate center, the SAP ecosystem tools we acquired with LCR.Dickson and our tax return managed service, among others. This shows the growth potential of our existing enterprise customer base, even with a customer that has a comprehensive and long-standing relationship with Vertex with another customer, a leader in global digital imaging solutions, a cloud-first strategy implemented by new leadership drove a transition to our cloud solution in the fourth quarter. This resulted in a new five year contract with mid six figures of additional annual revenue for Vertex partnership we have built over the past 12 years plus the value they have experienced over the years provided us with the opportunity to win the business without having to compete in an RFP. We are currently working with them to move their self-hosted tax solution to the cloud seamlessly with tight connections to their Oracle ERP and other key systems.Similarly, another existing customer, one of the largest online marketplaces in the world expanded their usage with us in the fourth quarter. During the renewal process, the customer consolidated several licenses added new geographies and increased its usage tiers. This resulted in high six figures of new revenue for VERTEX RSM, a top 10 accounting firm partnered with us on this implementation.As I mentioned, ERP conversions are one of the primary factors for companies to reevaluate how they're handling indirect tax. One example in the fourth quarter resulted in a high five figure new contract with the global consumer products company. This Company moved to Oracle Cloud in doing so rebid their indirect tax solution as they were unhappy with their existing provider. One of our competitors, Vertex won this deal because of our ability to operate in a one-to-many environment and seamlessly integrate with both their ERP provider, Oracle Cloud and their global instance of Salesforce Commerce. The customer also had peace of mind moving their tax engine to Vertex based on the valued experience, one of their entities has had with our returns outsourcing service in the SAP ecosystem, we had a notable win with a global provider of equipment and services to the oil and gas industry for this customer.And as for Hana transformation drove a company-wide initiative to centralize global tax compliance. This led to seven figures of additional revenue for Vertex, the support of our partners at SAP, as well as the were also key to this new business win in the Microsoft ecosystem, a global manufacturer of nutritional supplements selected Virtex-E to support its migration to Dynamics three 65. And in the work the ecosystem, we won several new deals, including one of the major stock exchanges, a regional health care system and a provider of financial software for the health care industry during the quarter. We also saw good examples of how audit pressure and compliance risks are driving business our way. As an example, we won a new deal with a mid-market business solutions company that was using its homegrown billing system as a platform to calculate indirect tax liabilities.The Company's tax department was manually entering tax rates into the system. Inevitably, this approach led to inaccuracies for the customer, which in turn led to audit pressure and liability for back taxes and penalties. The Company's tax department worked quickly to get the technology needed to updated systems and Vertex prevailed in the results in our FT. in part due to our leading tax content database and ability to handle the vagaries of tax calculations across a product list with more than 5 million separate SKUs as we noted in our annual sales tax rates and rules report last month, US sales tax rate changes reached a 10-year high in 2023. In addition to hundreds of new taxes that were imposed with over 20,000 taxing jurisdictions globally, keeping up with the regulatory changes and escalating complexity of the tax environment, both domestically and internationally is a massive tax for any tax department.Now I'd like to highlight a couple of the wins on the international front that I'm very proud of. We want a high profile, new logo in the fourth quarter with a major luxury brand in the jewelry industry customer launch an online marketplace. So it's customers that have a secondary market in which they buy, sell and trade its products, many of which have long waiting lists at retail stores. This customer quickly acknowledge that tax complexity for a global marketplace was beyond their internal capabilities as well as the compliance risks that this represented This led to a search for a third party provider thanks to the trusted relationship we have built with the US division of the company. We added this prestigious new client to our customer base. Additionally, Vertex was selected by one of the fastest growing middle market providers of software for the office of the CFO internal system changes to its billing platform resulted in an evaluation of its existing solution for Qix one based on the ability to operate seamlessly in the Company's new IT environment while providing the expertise to smoothly, execute the migration process.In addition, the customer determined that Vertex's tax content was more thorough and accurate than the competition. We are excited about this win because it's new customers owned by a private equity firm. It also owns a competitor of ours that was included in the RFP process. Even so a competitor could not successfully compete in solving the tax complexity of the portfolio company. They also did not enjoy the high level of confidence and trust to deliver that Vertex received from the advisory community that influenced our win. As I look to 2024, I'm extremely confident in the momentum we continue to build. I am excited about the rapidly growing pipeline from our recent partnership with Shopify and their move up market. And I am seeing tangible progress to drive margin improvements with our ongoing investments in generative AI to support tax content expansion, software development and creation of new customer experience tools.Finally, let me say a few words about our Garrow tender offer. From the outset, we were well advised on the nuances of Swedish law for tender offers, which opened the potential for additional parties to join into bidding. We were prepared for what unfolded and determined to stay true to our disciplined investment philosophy with our differentiated approach of combining our VAT compliance solution with e-invoicing capabilities through a single portal, we are solving highly valued challenge for tax departments. We've been clear the e-invoicing component could be solved via partnership or acquisition and when the Darryl presented us with both options, we pursued it at the right price.Currently, our multiyear partnership agreement with Pago that we announced last October remains in place. We are comfortable with the strength of the terms of that agreement. So in the near term, that is how we will continue to handle e-invoicing opportunities. At the same time, we have considerable options with other e-invoicing companies that are attracted to our highly sought after customer base. And with recent legislation delaying the implementation of e-invoicing in France and Poland, we will remain strategic in our actions. I look forward to sharing more about our plans for this market opportunity in the future.In conclusion, I remain very confident in the path ahead. The fundamentals of our business are strong and we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant market opportunity from today's increasingly complex tax landscape.John will now take you through the financials for 2023 and our guidance for 2024. John?"", 'John Schwab', ""Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll now review our results in detail and provide financial guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2024. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $154.9 million, up 18.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. And for the full year, total revenue was $572.4 million, up 16.4% from 2022.As David mentioned, this exceeded the high end of both our fourth quarter and full year revenue guidance by $7.9 million. Note that in the fourth quarter, contract renewals with several major customers resulted in usage tear true ups of approximately three to $4 million. For comparison sake, last year's fourth quarter usage tier true-ups were in the $1 million to $2 million range.Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter increased 17.9% over last year's fourth quarter to $130.7 million. Full year subscription revenue was $480.8 million up 15.7% year over year. Services revenue in the fourth quarter grew 19.7% over last year's fourth quarter to $24.2 million full year services revenue was $91.6 million, up 20.2% year over year. And cloud revenue was $60.6 million, up 29.9% from last year's fourth quarter. Full year cloud revenue was $214.6 million, up 27.1% year over year and exceeding our full year guidance higher than expected full year growth was in part due to the usage tiered true up revenue, which contributed about half a percentage point to the full year cloud revenue growth rate, annual recurring revenue or ARR was $512.5 million at the end of the year, representing 18.9% year-over-year growth.Net revenue retention or NRR remained strong at 113%. This was up from 110% in the comparable 2022 period and up from 111% in the third quarter. Gross revenue retention or GRR was 95% at quarter end within our targeted range of 94% to 96%. Average annual revenue per customer or ARPC., which is based on our direct customer count, was $118,910 in the fourth quarter, up from $112,690 in the third quarter of 2023.For the remainder of the income statement discussion, I will be referring to non-GAAP metrics. These non-GAAP metrics are reconciled to GAAP results in the earnings press release that was issued this morning. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $109.6 million and gross margin was 70.7%. This compares with gross profit of $94.4 million and a gross and a 72% gross margin in the same period last year.Gross margin on subscription software revenue was 76.8% compared to 78.4% in last year's fourth quarter and 78.3% in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in gross margins was driven by increased cloud and hosting costs to support customers in the multi-cloud environments. Services gross margin was 38.2% compared to 36.8% in last year's fourth quarter and 35.3% in the third quarter of 2023.Turning to operating expenses, in the fourth quarter, research and development expense was $11.3 million compared to $11 million last year. For the full year, R&D was $52.2 million with capitalized software spend. Included R&D spend was $23.5 million for the fourth quarter and $100.7 million for the full year, which represents 15.2% of revenue and for the fourth quarter and 17.6% of revenue for the full year, selling and marketing expense was $34.4 million, up 3.5% from last year's fourth quarter.For the year, selling and marketing expense was $129.2 million, up 12.1% from last year. And general and administrative expense was $31.4 million, up $2.6 million from last year. For the full year, general and administrative expense was $124.9 million compared to $112.7 million last year.Both fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA exceeded the upper end of our guidance with our growth investment program largely completed in mid 2023. We are seeing improved earnings leverage, which was apparent in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $32 million, an increase of $11 million or over 52% year over year. In addition, the fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.7%.For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $100.8 million, up $22.2 million from last year. As you may recall, our ERP conversion in the second quarter resulted in short-term disruptions to billings which in turn impacted our cash flow in the second and third quarters. This was largely resolved by the end of the fourth quarter as we delivered $28.8 million of free cash flow. Note that DSO remained at elevated levels in the fourth quarter, but we expect to resolve this by end of the first half of 2024 for the full year, free cash flow was $6.1 million compared to $3.4 million last year. We ended the fourth quarter with over $68.2 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Total bank debt was $46.9 million and investment securities totaled $9.5 million. For additional liquidity, we also have $200 million of unused availability under our line of credit.With Vertex's strong execution, we have built a foundation for growth and profitability that we expect to be a shareholder value-creating engine for years to come. The growth investments we've made position us to deliver consistent revenue growth in the mid to high 10s, which we, in turn, expect to drive earnings leverage and expanding adjusted EBITDA margins. Reflecting this confidence we are guiding above consensus for 2024. Accordingly, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue in the range of $152 million to $156 million, which would represent 16% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $29 million to $31 million, which would represent an increase of approximately $8 million or 45% at the midpoint.For the full year 2024, we expect total revenue in the range of $650 million to $660 million, representing annual revenue growth of 14% at the midpoint. While the full year revenue growth embedded in our guidance is slightly lower than what we delivered for the full year of 2023. This is due to two factors.First, over the last two years, we have deliberately increased our focus and commitment to enabling and supporting our global alliance partners who implement our software and help drive software subscription revenue to our business. As a result of this shift of focus, you are seeing and will continue to see a reduced growth rate for our services business. We expect services revenue to grow in the mid to single digits on a percentage basis in 2024.Secondly, we do not expect a high level of fourth quarter usage tier true up revenue that I mentioned earlier to reoccur in the fourth quarter of 2024. Offsetting this in 2024, we expect cloud revenue growth to accelerate to approximately 28% and software subscription revenue to accelerate to more than 16% for the full year of 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $130 million to $135 million, representing an increase of $32 million or 31% at the midpoint and a full year adjusted EBITDA margin of just over 20%.David will now make some closing comments before we open up for Q&A. David?"", 'David DeStefano', ""Thanks, John. As I said at the top of the call, I'm very pleased with our execution in 2023. By any measure. It was a terrific year for Vertex Vertex has always been a consistent, durable, profitable grower, even back to our days as a privately-held family-run business. But the growth investments we made from 2020 through mid 2023 at further energize the Company from top to bottom. Accordingly, with continued strong execution, we see plenty of runway and opportunity to continue the standard of performance we set at 2023 in the years to come.With that, we will take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Chris Quintero, Morgan Stanley.', 'Chris Quintero', ""Hey, guys, congrats on the outstanding results here. Really, really impressive. You're clearly seeing the benefit of this long investment cycle that you just concluded. So just taking a step back as you look back on that journey in all the areas that you invested in, from your perspective, what have been the key kind of one to two needle movers for you that have really made the most impact today?"", 'David DeStefano', 'Thanks, Chris. I would say that our investment in our partner ecosystem and alliances is really strengthen our growth vectors. And then when you couple that with the new products we brought to market around our customer success function, really labeling the customer success function to drive those new offerings and the products we acquired through acquisition I would say the combination of those two things has really fueled it is additive to our consistent growth story.', 'Chris Quintero', ""Got it. That's very helpful. And then really great to see that cloud growth guide of 28% for next year? And what gives you the confidence in that guide? And where do you expect to see more of the growth to come from? Is it more migrations from the on-prem version or just a testament to that really strong new logo growth that you're seeing?"", 'David DeStefano', ""Yes. I think the tailwinds of our business, we think about the consistent regulatory pressure that our customers face. We had a record year in compliance changes last year, and you couple that with the ongoing digital transformations that are going on across the industry, both of those two things that are, I think, are going to play out strongly in 24 and beyond.And I think that really is where we're going to see why we why we're so confident in our cloud growth. I don't see any fundamental shift in the migration process. I think that will continue to be a smaller part and again, member with our cross-sells, Chris, a lot of our cross-sales are customers who might have self-hosted software and now want to go to cloud software for the next offering and so I think with that cross-sell motion and the our motion that we're enjoying, I think you'll see a cloud growth there. So I think that's really the drivers of that cloud success in 24."", 'Chris Quintero', 'Excellent. Thanks, David. Congrats again.', 'Operator', 'Matt Pfau, William Blair.', 'Matt Pfau', ""Great. Thanks for taking my questions. And great results guys. Tom, wanted to follow up on the commentary related to e-invoicing and Garrow. And I think and given the bidding war that for Spire, there is there's a view that figure it was a very unique asset in addressing e-invoicing.But based on your comments that it makes, it seem like even if the Garrow partnership doesn't work out, there's other potential partnerships or perhaps ACQUISITION options out there. So is that correct? And any more detail you can provide on how you're thinking about addressing that opportunity longer term?"", 'David DeStefano', ""Yes, Matt, thank you. I definitely believe that Pago at the right price was an interesting asset for us. But the e-invoicing solution without the single portal, combined with that compliance is not as high a value. And so clearly, what makes what's the differentiated value with our customer base, combined with the way we've married up our VAT compliance solution and an invoice provider is really how we can how we're going to differentiate in the market.And so I'm very comfortable and confident that given the invoicing volume of our customer base, we have a lot of options about how we're going to solve for that other piece, figure out what the right price was a wonderful asset, but it is clearly not I'm the only game in town by any means."", 'Matt Pfau', ""Great. And just a follow-up on the e-invoicing. Wanted to also clarify the comments around the time line for implementation of that regulation in some countries. It seems like perhaps we're still a few years out from that opportunity becoming a more material driver. So you all have some time here to sort of formulate your strategy. Is that correct? Just wanted to confirm those comments."", 'David DeStefano', ""Yes. There's certainly activity in the market now that that's opportunity that we want to get after. So what we did, but some of the bigger economies that are looking at and have pushed out their dates, which just again affords us the ability to be very strategic and disciplined in what we do, which is something we've always tried to do to drive long-term shareholder value. I see it playing out and strongly again in this scenario."", 'Matt Pfau', 'Okay. Perfect. Appreciate you taking my questions.', 'Operator', 'Steve Enders, Citi.', 'Steve Enders', ""I think for your taking the questions, this is George on for Steve. Maybe just first to start, you guys laid out this investment plan that obviously reaping the rewards of that. When you think about the success that you're seeing this acceleration of growth across a number of metrics, does that bring you back to the drawing table to maybe reconsider a more aggressive reinvestment posture going into 2024?"", 'David DeStefano', ""George, thanks for the question. And I would tell you that we continue to invest heavily in our R&D function to bring new products to market. The investment strategy we embarked on over the last three years was really to build out a much more mature go-to-market approach across Europe, U.S. middle market, advancing our ecosystem profile also that we had more tentacles into the market to deliver value as we brought either bought companies, acquire companies or added new products to our portfolio.And so I don't see any slowdown in the R&D function at all. We can be much more tactical now and we add in the go to market areas because we've got the base and the quality of talent and and team ready to execute on that. And so I think that's really I would want to highlight the back office efforts we've put in place around our ERP system really give us a scalable infrastructure to really drive margin over time through our G&A G&A operations."", 'Steve Enders', ""Okay. Super helpful. And then the record high NRR was great to see. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about break that down a little bit. What's been resonating? Is there any CPI component to that? And is there any CCPI. component baked into 24 that might that might look a little different? Just kind of any help on those breaking it apart and are basically there's basically."", 'David DeStefano', ""George, there's three components to what drives our NRR. About 50% of it comes from the cross-sells of new offerings into our installed base, about 25% comes from selling more of an existing product to the customer. We call them entitlements where they're going through revenue bands and we end up it cost them more. And then the last 25% comes from price increases.And I think the execution in Q4 really reflects consistent performance across all three with a little bit of uptick in the cross-sell and entitlements, Harry, but nothing unique in the price here. We're pretty disciplined in our in our price increases. That's really not fueling the bulk of this at this point."", 'Steve Enders', 'Okay, great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter.', 'Operator', 'Adam Hotchkiss, Goldman Sachs.', 'Adam Hotchkiss', ""Great. Thanks for taking the questions and David, you mentioned some of the new logo wins in Europe. I'm curious how you view the competitive environment there, given it seems there's a lot of interest across the office of the CFO to get involved with some of the new Easy invoicing regulations or your go-to-market teams seeing any of this RFP? Is companies looking to get ahead of this today or do you think and there's going to be more a little bit more of a reactionary type of focus from companies in Europe, given some of the delays and regulations?"", 'David DeStefano', ""Appreciate it. Thank you, Adam, for the question. You know, the beauty and the benefit of the pain of working in the indirect tax spaces, unless there's propane, there's not advanced budget for it. So one of things we've learned over the years is you want to have the right solution just in time to solve the problem. But getting there too soon, doesn't always it doesn't always generate additional revenue because there's not a lot of discretionary spend.And so I think where and we see that consistently playing out here. And I that's why I feel like we can be very strategic with our decision making as we move forward here, our Europe team has done a great job of building a very strong customer reference base, which is essential in the indirect tax community and certainly with some of the offerings we brought forward like chain flow Accelerator, which is really differentiated in the SAP space.And you think about, again, our largest one of our larger ecosystems along with Oracle and SAP. And and we're enjoying some really nice positioning inside of the SAP customer and in our customer environment, right now. So I still feel like we're very well positioned in that space."", 'Adam Hotchkiss', ""Great. That's really helpful color. And then, John, on margins, just curious if there's anything you're contemplating this year from an incremental investment perspective, given the evolving evolving invoicing environment around the gear or those considerations will be beyond this year?"", 'John Schwab', ""Yes. I think from a margin perspective, again, we talked a little bit about where we sit, where we stand and kind of what we feel about the future. I don't anticipate anything significant coming in that are not already contemplated in our guidance. I think we feel good about the investments we've made here to four and R & D and kind of bringing things together.And I think we feel like we're going to stay that path and continue to continue to work with the partners that we've kind of been talking to certainly from an invoicing standpoint. But we've got real good real good momentum and traction regarding some of the R&D efforts in some of the other areas for, again, additional new products and things going forward. So I don't anticipate a big wholesale change in terms of how we're thinking about investment to get after additional the additional spend."", 'Adam Hotchkiss', 'Okay. Really helpful. Thanks, David.', 'Operator', 'Samad Samana, Jefferies.', 'Samad Samana', ""Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the great numbers. And first one, maybe, John for you. If I just look you guys have seen growth get much, much stronger, but OpEx has been very, very limited in terms of expansion since December of 22. So should we think about the Company being kind of at the right level of OpEx, how should we think about maybe that going forward? I know you've given margin guidance, but just philosophically, help us understand if we're at the right place in terms of headcount and maybe where expenses should trend? And then I have a follow-up for for you, David."", 'John Schwab', ""Yes, thanks so much for the question. I think as we've talked about it before, the significant amount of our investments took place in the years leading up to 2023, middle of the year 23, we did see an inflection point. We felt with the go-live of the ERP system in a number of the other areas, really getting to getting to the level that we had anticipated when we undertook the journey. So I feel very good about where that is.I think we will continue to expand from a headcount standpoint because again, there's growth opportunities and things that are out there that we'll get after. But we do anticipate and continue. And as you would see from our guidance getting leverage out of our cost infrastructure, again, we've talked about G&A we've talked about some level of selling and marketing expense seeing that there.We're always being opportunistic from an R&D standpoint. So we feel good about where we are now from a headcount standpoint from an expense standpoint, but there is some some level of growth built into it. But again, you'll start to see that leverage really come through now that those big investments are passed."", 'Samad Samana', 'Great. And then, David, just on the partnership side, especially the big ones like SAP and Oracle, how are you seeing the joint go-to-market efforts there? Is it is it doing as you as you expected? Is it doing better than expected? And maybe how should we think about how partnerships will contribute to the strong 2020 for cloud revenue growth.', 'David DeStefano', ""Yes, thank you so much. And we continue to see really solid performance across the base there. And I think you really have to marry well with the Alliance community because it's the combination of the two that is really differentiated for us and supports the strong win rate we have.And I think that the pipeline of activities we look forward to a lot of what we the team accomplished in 2023 didn't even benefit for some of the ETC. migration efforts that we think are going to play out in 24, five and six. And so I think the team has done a good job of positioning inside of positioning of inside of those ecosystems and our conscious effort now to slowdown our services growth to really reward our our partner ecosystem further, I think as a business, it's really aligned to the what we want to envision growing this business as we go forward here."", 'Samad Samana', 'Great. Appreciate you taking my question.', 'Operator', 'Alex Sklar, Raymond James.', 'Alex Sklar', ""Great. Thank you. David, you talked about high 10s growth and targeting upwards. It's kind of a 20% growth in some of the recent quarters. You just delivered on 19% ARR growth. Has anything changed in terms of your belief on the organic opportunity ahead for Vertex."", 'David DeStefano', ""Thanks, Alex. No, I see the I still see again that you have to look at the tailwinds. I really look at what are the macro events that are driving opportunities to us. And I think business model changes and mergers and acquisitions at the enterprise space continue to play out the regulatory environment is only getting more complex and we are painful. And again, we're competing largely against in-house systems that ultimately need to be replaced. And so I think when you take those two and add in ongoing digital transformations and ERP upgrades on the strength of what we've envisioned happening. And what we embarked on over three years ago in our investment strategy is really playing out quite nicely and I don't see that changing in the near term at all."", 'Alex Sklar', ""Okay, great. Great color there. And maybe one for you, John, just in terms of guidance, philosophy and how we should look at the 2024 outlook. I think in past years, you've spoken to not being kind of a huge embedded beat and raise Cadence until you get later into the year. I'm just curious if anything changed in terms of how you approach the guidance this year?"", 'John Schwab', ""Yes. No, that's a great question. No, I appreciate it. Very much, Alex. I think we are very consistent and thoughtful about our guidance methodology, and I think we expect that we'll continue with that same as we move forward. I think we feel it's it's done us well to kind of be thoughtful and conservative about how we set that. And then the way that we approach it is not anticipated to change our."", 'Alex Sklar', 'Great. Thank you both.', 'Operator', 'Daniel Jester, BMO Capital Markets.', 'Daniel Jester', 'Yes, great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. David you gave us a little bit of update about your efforts around AI in the prepared remarks and love that you can I could expand on the areas of opportunity in 24? And how are your customer conversations progressing along those lines?', 'David DeStefano', ""Yes. So thanks for the question, Danielle. We continue to be really disciplined in our investment here. We've made a conscious effort to look at ways to improve productivity and drive more efficiency in our business. And we're seeing some really good sprouts of opportunity. I think on the customer funds, probably in the long run more exciting because obviously we think we can drive more revenue from the business.And one of the things our customers have always valued in our brand is around trust and its trust in that we can be more accurate than they can do on their own. And so the conversations and the reason we're inviting our customers into the dialogue early in the process is to make sure they retain that confidence. And so we've set up a number of design programs and labs to sort of engage them in that in that journey to make sure we're meeting their expectations and not undermining trust in the process."", 'Daniel Jester', ""Great. That's great color. And then maybe one for you, John, if I look at the deferred revenue on the balance sheet in 2021 and 2022, that was kind of growing in the 10s. But kind of exiting the year, we've kind of flipped to growth sort of in the mid-single digits. So is there anything that we should be thinking about with regards to deferred revenue and the visibility you have on the growth algorithm for 24? Thank you."", 'John Schwab', ""Yes, thanks for the question, Dan. And there's nothing that's changed with respect to our visibility or how we think about the business in terms of kind of our confidence and ability to read into deferred revenue and what's on the horizon. I would tell you that with the change back in 2021, we did change how we do some of our our drug pricing for on-prem software that's become a much smaller piece.But over time that's come down. And so that's why you see a little bit of a change relating to the deferred revenue over time. So that migration was expected to take place and has but no, from an overall standpoint, our ability to see to see into the future with our customers, the contract length and the way that that's manifesting itself in deferred revenue have been virtually unchanged."", 'Daniel Jester', 'Great. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Pat Walravens, Citizens JMP Securities.', 'Pat Walravens', ""Well, great. Thank you. And let me add my congratulations on the Q4 results, fabulous. So David and part of this comes from some questions I've gotten from investors. But prior to Garrow, I would not have expected Vertex to be willing to pay nearly $600 million for an asset and to partner with someone like Silverlake to get the financing. So how should we think about Vertex's future appetite for M&A? How big a transaction are you willing to do? And should you maybe have more cash on the balance sheet to provide more flexibility around those kinds of things in the future?"", 'David DeStefano', ""Thanks, Pat. I think one of things I enjoy with our Board is willing to do what's necessary to support the long-term strategy of the company and the confidence they have in management to execute on that. And I think what happened over the last three years as the company has continued to perform better than expected, beating our own budget and guidance expectations. We've completed that investment cycle and the Board was supportive that there was an opportunity and then it was at the right price, we would do what was necessary to make it happen.And so I don't think that philosophy will change at all, given the strength of our execution and the strength of the organization's performance. If the right opportunity presents itself and it serves our customers long-term needs, our Board will support doing what's necessary to make it happen and what that is that the world will be informed as we go forward. But rest assured, there's strong confidence across from the Board down through management on that."", 'Pat Walravens', 'Great. Thank you. And I think everyone does appreciate how you stay disciplined on that.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Brad Reback, Stifel.', 'Brad Reback', 'Great. Thanks very much. Gentlemen, can you remind us what the true of how that impacts ARR. both in the quarter and going forward?', 'David DeStefano', ""Thanks for the question, Brad front, the true ups, the way that it works is the true up is really for periods that have passed. So it isn't a direct impact to revenue for the prior overages that took place. But what's typically happening at the same time, Brad, is those same. Customers are renewing for a new contract going forward. And typically that's coming in at a higher at a higher tier. So you are getting better.You are getting benefit from that customer renewing at a higher tier. So it's very similar to the amount that goes backwards, but ARRs the forward look. And so the forward look typically has an increase in it when you come out of a customer entitlement upgrade like that."", 'Brad Reback', 'Great. And then as the cloud business gets bigger and bigger, can you also remind us sort of what the impact is on gross margin longer-term? Thanks.', 'David DeStefano', ""Yes, yes, that's a great question, Brad. Thank you know, over time, what we have seen is that customers are moving. There is a migration toward the cloud we have. We have mentioned that our cloud revenue and our cloud margins, if you will, were a little bit a little bit lower than our than our on-prem margins, but a lot of that had to do with some of the leverage that we got. And as more uptake in the multi-tenant cloud started, the data starts to take place. We are seeing those margins increase. So we feel very good about that.We feel that the margins, again, with the volume that we're getting, that the margins will find themselves just up just under where the where the on-prem margins were. Obviously, there's a cost there to host and keep the cloud and keep the cloud costs going. But we feel very good that those margins will be able to kind of stay in that range of where they are where they are right now."", 'Brad Reback', 'Allison, thanks very much.

Revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year 2023 was $112.1 million and $431.5 million, respectively, a year-over-year increase of 3.2% and 5.3%, respectively. Clients within the United States represented 51% while international clients represented 49% of total revenue for both the fourth quarter and full year 2023 annualized recurring revenue was $432.3 million for the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 2.9%.Revenue retention rate for service subscriptions, which makes up 96.4% of our revenue, was 90% with more than 79% of subscription revenue noncancelable for at least 12 months. We note that for the full year 2023, our total revenue measures on a constant currency basis was negatively impacted by 0.6% due to FX movements. The decline in our revenue retention rate for the year ended December 31st, 2023 was due to attrition during the fourth quarter as certain clients did not renew specific subscriptions.However, in some cases maintained or added subscriptions for other product, our net billings during the fourth quarter of 2023 was flat to the comparable period of 2022 because record fourth quarter new client invoicing was able to offset fourth quarter retention losses billings for the fourth quarter were $160.7 million compared to $160.4 million for the prior year fourth quarter.For the full year 2023, billings increased 2.3% to $418.5 million. Gross margin was 61% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 62.3% for full year 2023 compared to 64.5% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 52.8% for prior year 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, gross margin was 61.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 62.8% for full year 2023 compared to 64.9% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 63.3% for prior year 2022 gross margin declined during the back half of 2023 as a result of continued investment in an expansion of our global engineering team needed to serve new client engagements in advance of related ratable contract revenue recognition.As noted in previous earnings calls, we are expecting continued gross margin pressure as we scale to meet new client engagements simultaneously. We are also working to improve gross margin by driving efficiencies and leveraging the benefits of growing global scale operating expenses, while inflationary pressures and high cost are still persistent for skilled labor across all theaters. We continue to attract and retain key talent. Moreover, our margin performance in light of the pressures highlighted previously underscores the advantage of our global footprint with centers of excellence and geographies for both talent and value remain attractive compared to higher price Capital Markets.Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was 31.2% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 33% for full year 2023 compared to 36.1% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 34.9% for prior year 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was 30.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 32.3% for full year 2023 compared to 35.4% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 34.1% for prior year 2022.General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding outside litigation costs, was 15.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 16.9% for full year 2023 compared to 16.7% of revenue for the prior year. Fourth quarter and 18.4% for prior year 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and litigation costs, G&A was 13.8% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 15.1% for full year 2023 compared to 15.6% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 17% for prior year 2022, we are seeing a good year-over-year improvement in G&A spend due to some restructuring measures and the initial substantial investments that were required to develop and launch.Our expanded portfolio of solutions are largely completed. However, G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to remain elevated compared to our peers due in large part to the ongoing calls for in-house legal and compliance teams and other costs made necessary by our ongoing Oracle litigation and compliance activities.Net outside litigation expense, which includes the Oracle settlement previously referenced was $4.3 million for the fourth quarter and was $9.8 million for the full year 2023 compared to $12.8 million for the prior year fourth quarter and $25.3 million per prior year 2022.This year's fourth quarter included an accounting charge of $2.7 million related to the $9.7 million Oracle cash settlement that I discussed earlier related to the remaining one injunction content matter. Litigation expenses will vary quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on current litigation activity.Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes outside litigation spend stock-based compensation, was 17.2% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 15.3% for full year 2023. Net income attributable to shareholders for the fourth quarter was $9.4 million, or $0.1 per diluted share. And for the full year 2023 was $26.1 million were $0.29 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fourth quarter was $17.1 million or $0.19 per diluted share.And for the full year 2023 was $48.4 million or $0.54 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA as defined in our press release was $21.3 million for the fourth quarter or 19% of revenue, and for full year 2023 was $71.9 million or 16.7% of revenue balance sheet. We ended the fiscal year with a cash balance of $115.4 million plus investments of $9.8 million consisting of short term treasuries and U.S. government agency securities, bringing readily available cash to $125.2 million compared to $129.1 million for the prior fiscal year.And during 2023, we reduced the principal balance on our term loan from $78.3 million to $72.6 million, resulting in a year-end net cash position, $52.6 million on a cash flow basis for the fourth quarter operating cash flow declined $1.1 million. And for the full year 2023, we generated $12.5 million compared to a decline of $1.9 million for the prior year fourth quarter and a positive $34.9 million for full year 2022.The year-over-year variance is due primarily to large nonrecurring payments made during the first quarter to our outside litigation counsel relating to the fourth quarter 2022 remaining two trial with Oracle and overhead restructuring charges. And during the fourth quarter as noted, we paid $9.7 million to settle the content matter. In addition, throughout 2023, we experienced lower client, multiyear prepayments and related collections compared to the prior year 2022, as clients retain cash in the higher rate environment for their own short-term investment opportunities and the preservation of cash.Lastly, FX headwinds noted also impacted cash flow. Deferred revenue as of December 31st, 2023, was approximately $287 million compared to $300 million from the prior year fourth quarter backlog, which includes the sum of billed deferred revenue and noncancelable future revenue was approximately $607 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $578 million for the prior year fourth quarter business outlook.The Company is continuing to suspend guidance as to future financial results until there is more clarity around the impacts from current litigation activity before the US federal courts and the Company's ongoing litigation with Oracle. For additional information and disclosures regarding the company's litigation with Oracle, please see our disclosures in the company's annual report on Form 10 K filed on February 28th, 2024, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Brian Kinstlinger, Alliance Global Partners.', 'Brian Kinstlinger', ""Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, am I going to start the expense side, you suspended revenue guidance for the obvious reasons. And so how do you plan on managing operating expenses over the next year is revenue while revenue is growing at a very modest clip.You expect to hold off making investments that's going to add OpEx with some investments that were just completed. Do you plan to cut cost do you think holding a line where you are right now before there's more clarity is the option we'd like to get some more understanding of what you can control?"", 'Seth Ravin', ""Sure, Brian, great to have the call. Of course, we have I think you could tell from the size of the sales force were I had mentioned we've continued to expand the sales force we're continuing to invest and lean in because of the size of the opportunity that we see. I think you're watching us relay that we are not looking to reduce costs.We are not in a hunker down position. We had modest growth across 2024, while we were busy spending and building out our global infrastructure to support all of these different product lines that we've launched, including launching, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks today, the remaining consult, which is a very large program on a global basis to take on its support provide managed service for a huge number of additional product lines, including IBM and others.So I think you're definitely not seeing us take a reduction of cost. I think we the reductions we've made have all been about streamlining operations where we're taking out some middle management. We're giving wider scope of responsibility to vice presidents and above to get better leverage but that's all about making sure that we're able to support and drive higher revenues and more accelerated growth into 24 and beyond.Great."", 'Brian Kinstlinger', ""And then on the international business side, the year-over-year growth rates decelerated for the third consecutive quarter, about 4.5% just in the fourth quarter. What's driving the deceleration or anything in the bookings trends?"", 'Seth Ravin', ""It suggests a reacceleration in this in the first half of 24 male given without getting into the guidance side of things, just focused on the business, we had some issues we had some issues down in the IANZ., the Australia New Zealand area. We had some issues in the Amea area, which we, of course have taken significant steps.We have a brand new GM running the EMEA region, which I'm very, very happy to announce. We brought him over from Adobe, a very strong player. And in the ANZ market, we have a new leadership there as well, where we've turned things around. I believe those two contributed to some of the challenges. We also have some evolution going on in Japan where we have a very strong client base, our largest in all of Asia Pac, as we now roll out our additional services there and we've reconfigured the sales force to be able to handle that.I think as you guys well understand every time you reconfigure a sales force, you have a little bit of lag and disruption into the operation. And we're very aware of that. But these are the kinds of changes necessary to be able to support the growth, the accelerated growth that we want in the future across all the product line portfolio Great."", 'Brian Kinstlinger', ""Last question. I'll get back in the queue. It might be related and might be some of the same answer, but you spoke to the 90% retention versus what's traditionally been three to four points higher and we've lost customers in these regions.And was there a similar rationale for the handful or so? How many customers left or were they at all different cases?"", 'Seth Ravin', ""Yes, I think, of course, as you can imagine, when we when we have higher retention losses than normal, if you look on a normalized basis, it happens that it's happened over the years where you kind of go up and down. I could tell you that we had a few larger cancellations.Two of them were in the Australian market which were pretty significant. But at the same time, those are existing clients there. They are huge clients who rotated out on a couple of products. They were they were running, but they're natural rotations and some of those things we just have to go back. One of them, I think was a loss we shouldn't have had. And so we've gone back to look at it. The other one wasn't anything we could do about it. It was just a business, a rotation.And then I saw one big one in the North American region which came as a surprise. Again, as part of an M&A. The biggest risk we always have is M&A because they change our management teams and we have to go in and resell our position when those management teams change. And so it is almost like a new sale because they don't know who we are, what are we doing in there?And that is a process that always creates risk for us. So in the world of business turn, M&A always present the biggest risk to the business in terms of ongoing contracts, but they often present new opportunities for us as well, where a management team may have been more stubborn or maybe not fully bought into the full portfolio, then we get a change of management and we get to come in and expand our footprint. But it does generally cause some level of churn when we had management change."", 'Brian Kinstlinger', ""Great. I have a few more, but I'll get back in the queue like others."", 'Seth Ravin', 'Terrific. Thanks, Brian.', 'Operator', 'Daniel Hibshman, Craig Hallum.', 'Daniel Hibshman', ""Hey, guys. Thanks for take my question. This is Daniel, on for Jeff Van Rhee. Just on the employee count, I saw that was up 9% sequentially, about 10% year over year, but still getting the non-GAAP OpEx down sequentially and year over year. Just curious how you manage that.Was that, you know, in the geographies you are hiring with the hiring really late in the quarter and then just maybe double-clicking on what areas you're hiring for, I know for sales, but just anything else on the roadmap roadmap, et cetera?"", 'Seth Ravin', ""Sure. Happy to answer that. I think you've got a few different things. One, I'm not a big fan of the employee count numbers. I know a lot of people look at that and say, well, if that percentage is higher than your actual growth. That looks like a problem, but it doesn't take into account the cost of the personnel. A lot of those hires are in lower-cost geographies.We have two big delivery centers between India and Brazil, which presents significantly different annual comp rates than you would have, for example, of course, in the United States or across in Europe, so from that point of view, yes, we have lower costs coming into it. That's one component that allows us to have the higher number of people by account number second, one is you're correct. We often do a lot of hiring on service delivery on the back end of the year.We are a back-end loaded business. And as you know, because we've been a bootstrapped business with literally what, $27.5 million of invested capital to drive over $400 million a year business. We have to use our own cash. We what that means is we're very good at hiring just in time. We don't hire generally in advance of contracts that allows us to minimize the burn cost of personnel, not being utilized and we wait for the contract signed and then we aggressively hire to fill that.And so that's very much with the fourth quarter as we grow our business in the fourth quarter, you're going to see a lot more hiring in the fourth quarter. So of course, you haven't seen the ratable costs on that yet. So that is a combination that drives that."", 'Daniel Hibshman', ""And then on the billings and backlog, those both came in pretty nicely. Just any more color on that in terms of the biggest drivers of that in terms of what's coming down the pipeline, any particular verticals, application services, what platform is seeing strength there?"", 'Seth Ravin', ""Well, I think we're seeing again good strength across all platforms. I think again, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, specifically strong in the SAP world where you've got thousands and thousands of companies being pressured by SAP to move their systems between 2025 and 2027 with threats of the support no longer being supported, which of course, is untenable for a major organization.And so that's created, again, an upward swing in demand because Rimini Street offers the only really proven global solution for large enterprises to make that move and continue to use the product for years to come.The other area, we saw a lot of growth in is the sales force managed service. Again, Salesforce is a big complex platform, requires additional work and support just like any other enterprise as platform and Rimini Street's well positioned to provide those services to clients even to other big service providers like NTT. who utilize US demand as their sales force platform."", 'Daniel Hibshman', 'And then maybe last for me just on the you already spoke some to the cost structure expectations for 24, but specifically on legal professional, just any thoughts on how we should be expecting that similar year in 24 relative to 23? And then the $9.7 million, was that already paid out? And where would I be seeing that on the financials?', 'Seth Ravin', ""Yes, I'll let Michael answer to see the $9.7 million on the financials, but that was a settlement of legal fees between Oracle and us. We settled that rather than continuing on in the court, and that was already reserved to a significant amount. I believe that was already reserves somewhere in the $6 million that Michael can answer that. So there was an additional amount, but we had already we had already looked at that, and that's where we came to a conclusion.But that ended the end of the contempt, a component of the of the trial sites. So at this point in time, as we always say, when we don't have a trial year, which 2024, there is no trial and we do have the appeals that are pending that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And those will continue through the process but to the District Court as well as the appellate courts.But that generally generally does not add up and to the kind of costs that you see when we have a full-blown trial. So I think when you look at the costs, we mentioned about how in Q1 24, we had paid out a significant amount of legal bills relating to the Oracle trial in late 2022. So I think you could take that back and you can you can notice that we probably would expect more moderate fees coming into 24 from what we've seen in that fee structure."", 'Michael Perica', ""And Michael here. Just to, as Seth noted, in Q4 2023 of the $4.3 million of legal related expenses, $2.7 million was it associated with the settlement. The total set settlement, As Seth noted, was $9.7 million, and that cash was also dispersed in Q4 of last year. We previously on in excess of 18 months ago, reserves, $6.9 million of the total $9.7 million. So that's the timing, if that helps."", 'Daniel Hibshman', ""I have that straight back to the details, and that's it from me."", 'Michael Perica', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Derrick Wood, TD Cowen. Please ask your question.', 'Derrick Wood', 'Yes, okay. Do we lose someone to open up his line again? Just second, please. Okay.', 'Operator', 'That is a route.', 'Seth Ravin', 'Sorry, go ahead and replace where you go.', 'Derrick Wood', ""Right. And the efforts for Artisan's coal on for Derek. On the total customer count was down quarter over quarter. I mean you guys mentioned that the NRRD. cell for DonTech rather was mostly from pressure where customers were ending kind of subscription on on certain products, but staying on others.So kind of help me bridge. You know, our saw is some of the NRR pressure from customers just totally going after many platform on as seen in the total customer count numbers, it kind of these are smaller customers churning off and the larger ones that are hitting at are still customers down the debt."", 'Seth Ravin', ""I think you got it. You've got a mix, you've got some customers rolling off. And I think what we saw really through 24. Some of this is related to the pandemic. We had customers who were in the process of moving off who had extended the life of their products for a few more years. So I think 24 was a bit of an interesting year, some customers who had extended finally moving forward.Those projects that have been delayed during the pandemic. And I think that was a little bit more of the roll off that you saw in this was some delayed roll off that might have been in prior years. So I think that that is a catch-up component and I didn't see anything during the year that was otherwise alarming or in any way, saw a trend. We didn't see that you have, for example, PeopleSoft, JD Edwards and Siebel clients. Those three platforms have been unsettled. There is no future product for those folks.They have to change to another product when they move off these platforms, they will completely move to something new. And so you are seeing some sunset of some of those people moving. That's natural in a sunset on a product line. And then again, you see others who are coming on board.So I don't think if there's any real trend here that differs year over year, I just think you have some ups and downs. And if you look at some of the bigger losses that happened, as I mentioned, related to management changes of M&A, where they decided to go a different direction. You have some of them where they had some internal issues that they needed to address in terms of dropping this product line.Adding another, we had one large client who dropped a large component, but also added in the same week, a large component. So this is part of what you get when you when you service a customer on a wider portfolio, there will be ups and downs in terms of what they sign up for what they drop, other living, breathing moving organizations. And there's nothing for cause and about what we do.And sometimes those will be bigger pieces. Sometimes they'll be smaller, but we didn't see any trend in terms of what we saw in the fourth quarter versus the rest of the year in terms of total clients, part of what you're watching is we launch so many new products that we had our sellers over rotated into cross-selling existing clients rather than bringing on new logos, not a comp, not an uncommon problem when you expand out a portfolio and it's popular with your existing client base and it's easier money.So we are putting incentives in place in 24 to incent sellers to take the tougher road of going out and bringing in new logos. And we're working on a multiple set of programs to drive and rotate back to more new logo acquisition, you saw the number there was a small increase in total new logos. That's exactly what you're watching. It's all the cross-sell activity, it's over rotated and we need to balance it better in 24."", 'Derrick Wood', ""Great. Super helpful. And then just one more for me. In terms of the sales force and reps with remaining custom coming online here on how you're getting reps up to speed so that they can sell into the existing customer base and go out and sell new customers on the new on the new portfolio here, it is already been trained for the sales team."", 'Seth Ravin', ""They've already received training for. We just had our sales ready SKO kickoff just literally weeks ago in early January and where they did learn about custom, they've learned about all the different product lines. It was a fantastic week of learning and training for the global organization, over 400 people from the global revenue organization from all the countries around the world were together led by our sales and revenue enablement organization.So I'm very confident in our ability to go out and position these products remaining customers, unlike anything else we've ever launched, it's basically opening the door and saying remaining ST is the best provider of enterprise software support in the world. And we believe we are also the best provider of the managed service for those products.And because we have our secret sauce of systems processes, the technology, the people that we're able to use, we believe we can provide service to a wide variety of products that we've never offered service for.And that is, again, an amazing offering of opening the door and saying bring us your enterprise product. If you want to get it supported, you want to get it managed. You want us to extend the life you want to get better service on it. We believe we can do that better than anyone else on just about every enterprise product out there."", 'Derrick Wood', 'Helpful off the floor. Thank you.', 'Seth Ravin', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And there are no further questions at this time. I will now hand the call back to Mr. Ravin for the closing remarks.', 'Seth Ravin', ""Great. Thank you so much, everyone again, for joining us on the fourth quarter at 23 earnings call and full year earnings call. I want to thank all of our Rimini Street colleagues once again for their great efforts over the past quarter and the year, it was a magnificent year of change and growth for the Company and repositioning ourselves as a much larger enterprise player.We look forward to having all of you join us on the next earning call.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date.

Last year's total dividend payments show that Fidelity National Information Services has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current share price of US$69.21. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services ', 'If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation.

If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fidelity National Information Services's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 19% a year over the previous five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Fidelity National Information Services has delivered 5.0% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Fidelity National Information Services is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future."", ""Should investors buy Fidelity National Information Services for the upcoming dividend? Not only are earnings per share shrinking, but Fidelity National Information Services is paying out a disconcertingly high percentage of its profit as dividends. It's not that we hate the business, but we feel that these characeristics are not desirable for investors seeking a reliable dividend stock to own for the long term. All things considered, we're not optimistic about its dividend prospects, and would be inclined to leave it on the shelf for now."", ""With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Fidelity National Information Services don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business.

In a nutshell, it's a characteristic that allows a company to grow stronger the larger it gets."", ""Visa and American Express are perfect examples. If only a few people used Visa or American Express credit cards, most merchants wouldn't accept them. Why build out a particular payment system for only a few customers?

But when a company cracks the code, the magic of network effects is unleashed.', 'As more people become Visa or American Express users, more merchants begin accepting that form of payment. A greater number of merchants accepting Visa or American Express attracts more users, which in turn attracts yet more merchants. It is a positive feedback loop that can persist for decades.', ""In many ways, American Express and Visa are still riding the wave of network effects. There's a reason just four companies dominate nearly 100% of the U.S. credit card market. Visa commands the largest market share at 49.5%, with American Express coming in last at around 7.4% .

Both Visa and American Express have cracked the code.', 'If network effects were responsible for the long-term growth of both companies, then it follows that the company with stronger network effects will produce superior results in the years to come. With more than 7 times the number of cards in circulation, Visa has a strong lead in this department.', ""Visa's superior network effects are partially evident in the company's return on equity -- a measure of how much net income flows to shareholders. After years of improvement, Visa's return on equity is around 46%, roughly 1.5 times higher than American Express."", 'Even more impressive, Visa was able to post these superior return figures while employing less debt than American Express. Often, companies are able to boost returns on equity by leveraging the balance sheet and taking on debt. By improving its return profile without a sizable increase in debt, Visa has proven that it can scale its business more efficiently than the competition.', ""On paper, Visa appears to be the better business. It has a higher return on equity, lower debt levels, greater market share, and arguably superior network effects. But there is another aspect to consider: each stock's valuation. It is possible, after all, to overpay for a great business. Even if American Express is less efficient as a business, a cheap stock price could make it the more attractive option."", 'Which stock is cheaper today? Without a doubt, the answer is American Express.', ""Right now, American Express stock trades at a free cash flow yield of 10.5%. That means a $100 investment would lay claim to around $10.50 in free cash flow. Visa, for comparison, trades at a free cash flow yield of just 3.3%. That's only $3.30 in free cash flow per $100 invested."", 'On an earnings basis, the situation remains unchanged.

Visa can likely better defend its market share and grow more efficiently than American Express. However, American Express stock is clearly the better bargain.', ""Which stock should you buy? The answer, surprisingly, is both. By diversifying your investment, you don't have to pick one winner over the other. Both operate high-quality businesses with strong economic moats. Visa has the advantage of size, while American Express has the advantage of being a better value."", 'So when faced with the dilemma of choosing between two quality businesses, the answer is often to buy both.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

In fact, he calls them ""timeless essentials of our world.""', ""Last year, Buffett used these two companies to illustrate the value of a strong, established business that pays a dividend. Buffett made more than $1 billion in dividends from them in 2022, and since he hasn't sold any and they both raised their dividends last year, he made even more in 2023. He expects that to continue in 2024, and he has no intention of selling a share of either stock."", ""Buffett said that Berkshire Hathaway's percentage of American Express' earnings in 2023 was more than the total cost of buying American Express stock."", ""American Express and Coca-Cola both closed out a challenging 2023 on a high note. American Express revenue increased 11% year over year, with a 27% increase in earnings per share (EPS). Coca-Cola's sales increased 6% year over year, with a 13% increase in EPS. Both companies' CEOs discussed their increased brand value as a factor in their performance."", ""Coca-Cola is a Dividend King and raised its dividend for the 62nd consecutive year this month.

It hasn't been as consistent with its increases, but it's made up for that with large increases -- more than double Coca-Cola's over the past 10 years."", 'Buffett sums up the lesson he\'s learned from holding onto these stocks for decades: ""When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', ""There's so much to take from that statement, and Buffett's wisdom doesn't need any elaboration.

from a viewer named my mother."", ""You're booking a flight."", ""You don't have enough points to cover the flight."", 'I told her to wait until she had enough points to buy it.', ""Tell me if I'm right or wrong."", ""ERIC ROSEN: Well, you're right and wrong, I would say."", 'There are certain airline programs that let you use points towards part of your flight, of course.', 'But for now, you obviously have to rack up enough points to actually use those to redeem them for the flights.', 'That said, you can also go for a variety of different credit cards, like a Chase Sapphire Preferred or an Amex Gold card, as part of your wallet so that you can actually use those points towards the cost of your airfare, without having to be loyal to one airline program or another.', 'So there are lots of ways to play the game to save some money.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, and also, you just heard our Kerry Hannon talking about the importance of being flexible and booking early, which I suspect is also helpful when you're using points."", 'ERIC ROSEN: Absolutely.', 'Those are great pieces of advice.', 'Airlines open up their award availability about 331 days in advance.', 'It seems to be typical among US airlines.', ""Some don't schedule quite that far out."", ""So if you know your plans well in advance, that's when you'll find that award availability."", ""But also, to her point, if you're flexible, you can find some last-minute deals."", ""As airlines find they have unsold seats, they'll open those up for award availability."", 'You can put those miles to use.', 'You might just end up flying, you know, on a Wednesday night instead of a Friday night, things like that.', ""So, the more you can be flexible, the more likely you're going to be able to put your points in miles to use."", 'MADISON MILLS: And I know part of the advice is to utilize price alerts and to, you know, again, be flexible.', 'To your point, Eric, is there a moment though where you advise people to go ahead and pull the trigger and not continue to hold and wait?', ""ERIC ROSEN: If you've been tracking prices and they're within your budget, I would say just book the flight then."", ""As you get closer and closer to the departure time, chances are those prices aren't going to drop."", ""You won't see a precipitous $500 to $200 drop on the airfare that you're going for."", ""So if it fits within your budget, you've got a limited amount of vacation days, the kids are off of school, don't wait too long to book your trip."", ""That said, if things really aren't in your budget, you might want to save it for a later vacation sort of like she had mentioned, where instead of going on your spring break now, think about an early summer trip before everyone's out of school, or towards the end of summer right before school starts again, where you might have a better chance of locking in a good price that fits your budget."", 'JULIE HYMAN: So, Eric, Maddie asked a question on behalf of her mom.', ""I'm going to ask you a question on behalf of myself."", 'I am not a points girl.', ""And I'm just wondering what-- and I have what is probably a mistaken perception in my mind that it's complicated, right?"", ""That navigating, accruing the points, you know, and then using them, that it's somehow difficult to do."", ""Disabuse me of that notion, if it's incorrect."", 'And tell me like, who are these-- who is best served by getting these points situations and cards and using them?', 'ERIC ROSEN: Absolutely.', ""You know, airline programs, hotel programs do a really good job at making it seem very complicated to use their miles or saying that like, you just need to rack up some miles and you'll get a free flight."", ""And then you go to look and you're not able to find the thing that you actually need."", 'If you want to keep things simple, there are a lot of ways you can do it, right?', ""Get a solid cashback card like the Chase Freedom, right, so you can earn points on every purchase and then use those points for cashback, whether it's on travel expenses or on something else."", ""We also suggest going for transferable points, something like Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, Capital One miles, where you can redeem them at a set rate for things like flights and hotels so you don't really have to do a ton of mental calculations in order to get some value."", ""Or you can transfer them to a variety of different airline and hotel partners that suit your need at a particular time, rather than having to stick to one program that might change its rules on a dime and leave you without enough miles for that trip you've been having your eye on for the last couple of months."", 'MADISON MILLS: All right.', ""Eric, one final question here for the users out there who have been utilizing credit card points, I'm wondering about the kind of transfer deals that come up from time to time."", 'What is the best way for folks to stay on top of those potential opportunities, and capitalize on them at the right times?', 'ERIC ROSEN: Definitely.', ""So when you're talking about are transfer bonuses, where instead of like one Amex point to one British Airways miles or one delta mile, for instance, you might get a 25% bonus."", ""So if you transfer 1,000 of them, you'll get 1,250 miles instead of the usual 1,000."", 'The best way to stay on top of those is to follow sites like ours, The Points Guy, because we have regular updates of what transfer bonuses are currently out there.', ""And I would say don't go speculatively transferring all of your points from those programs all at once because you should have a specific imminent redemption in mind where you can really take advantage of that extra value, rather than counting on something coming down the pike in a few months time."", ""Because like I said, programs can change, or that hotel that's in one category of award redemption today could go up the next day and then you've transferred all these points and you're not quite able to use them because you can't transfer them back to your other original account."", 'MADISON MILLS: All right, Eric.', 'We really appreciate it.', 'Thank you so much for that advice and have a great weekend.', 'Thank you.', 'ERIC ROSEN: Thank you.']"

I'm pleased to report, that we delivered exceptional performance across the board, despite an uncertain macro environment. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by the momentum of our expanded all-flash product portfolio. This strength coupled with continued operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for consolidated gross margin, operating margin, and EPS for the second consecutive quarter. Entering FY 2024, we laid out a plan to drive better performance in our Storage business and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business, while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macroeconomy to further improve our profitability."", 'These actions have delivered strong results to-date, support our raised outlook for the year. And enhance our position for the long-term. Only NetApp delivers a comprehensive architecture based on a single operating system, that supports any application or data type, spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments, and is available in traditional CapEx or as-a-service procurement models. Our unified data solutions, address some of the biggest priorities IT organizations face today, modernizing legacy infrastructure, improving resiliency against ransomware attacks, and building scalable, high performance data pipelines for AI workloads. The consistent operations, common management tools, integrated data services, and unique and proven capabilities for Hybrid Cloud of our unified storage architecture, provides customers the ability to simplify at scale and lower storage costs.', 'Our silo-free approach to unified data storage is clearly resonating with customers, driving healthy demand for our products and services, and positioning us well to deliver long-term growth. Turning to the results of the quarter, we delivered robust year-over-year performance in our Hybrid Cloud segment with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 10%, driven by momentum from our newly introduced all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year. Strong customer demand for our industry leading all-flash solutions drove all-flash growth of 21% year-over-year, to an all-time high annualized revenue run rate of $3.4 billion. In Q3, our all-flash business expanded to approximately 60% of Hybrid Cloud segment revenue.', ""As Mike will detail, we expect a sustainable step-up in our baseline product gross margin going forward with the continued revenue shift to all-flash. The AFF C-Series all-flash arrays again exceeded our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. As customers modernize Legacy 10k Hard Disk Drives and Hybrid Flash environments, we are displacing competitors' installed bases with our All-Flash Solutions, driving share gains. Our newly introduced ASA families, of SAN-optimized, high-performance and capacity-oriented all-flash arrays also outperformed our expectations. We're excited about the enormous potential in the nearly $20 billion SAN market. Our modern all-flash SAN arrays, backed by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees, are well-positioned to redefine the competitive landscape."", 'In Q3, we had numerous competitive take-outs across a broad set of workloads and vertical markets as customers leveraged our C-Series and ASA products to modernize their legacy infrastructures and deploy new applications like Artificial Intelligence. We continue to see strong interest in our advanced portfolio of Ransomware Protection Solutions. We help customers, take proactive steps to protect, detect, and recover their data. Competitive Solutions focus only on data recovery, but NetApp keeps data protected and secured from the start with products designed to block cybersecurity risks and mitigate the high cost of downtime. ONTAP is the first Enterprise-Class Storage Solution validated by the NSA for the Commercial Solutions for Classified Program, demonstrating the strength of our state-of-the-art, data protection and cybersecurity solutions.', 'We saw good momentum in AI, with dozens of customer wins in the quarter, including several large NVIDIA SuperPOD and BasePOD deployments. We help organizations in use cases that range from unifying their data in modern data lakes to deploying large model training environments, and to operationalize those models into production environments. To best take advantage of Generative AI capabilities, customers are looking to augment foundational models with their own data. Our high-performance, scalable unified data storage systems create intelligent data pipelines that allow customers to capture, aggregate and prepare their data for AI. NetApp delivers the data management capabilities for security, performance, and simplicity that enterprises require for their GenAI workflows.', 'We continue to advance our position with the development of GenAI driven cloud and on-premises solutions in partnership with industry leaders. Demand for consumption options is also growing as some customers look to increase budget flexibility in an ongoing uncertain macro and higher interest rate environment. However, this is not a universal mandate. Our unified data storage solutions are available as CapEx, as-a-service, and cloud native offerings, providing customers with the widest range of buying options, enabling them to meet their budget requirements. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering, delivered another strong quarter, with revenue growing triple-digits from Q3 a year ago. Keystone is a great solution for customers who want a cloud-like operating model on premises.', 'For customers who are ready to move to the cloud, we uniquely partner with the leading hyperscalers to deliver cloud-native storage services. Public Cloud segment revenue was $151 million, up 1% year-over-year. First party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly, with the ARR of these services up more than 35% year-over-year. These offerings are highly differentiated and tightly aligned to customer buying preference. We continue to deepen our hyperscaler partnerships, and deliver growth in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR with this part of the portfolio. As I outlined last quarter, we are taking action to sharpen our approach to our Public Cloud business. As a part of this plan, we exited two small services in the quarter.', 'We also began the work of refocusing Cloud Insights and InstaClustr to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings and integrating some standalone services into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes to widen our competitive moat. In Q4, we anticipate approximately $20 million in ARR headwinds from unrenewed subscriptions. This will create minimal revenue impact and should be largely offset by growth in first-party and marketplace services. We will continue refining our focus in fiscal year 2025, building a stronger base from which to grow. Our hyperscaler partnerships and natively integrated storage services, position us to address the new and emerging GenAI opportunity in the cloud. A leading open-source developer of GenAI tools, datasets and models is leveraging AWS’ FSx for NetApp ONTAP as a part of its offerings.', ""The customer was looking for a high-performance and resilient file storage solution to train extensive AI/ML workloads. FSxN gave them a scalable solution with performant storage for intensive AI model training. As a fully managed service, FSxN removes operational burdens, allowing their DevOps teams to focus on business value activities. In summary, we entered the final quarter of fiscal year '24 in a much stronger position than we were at the start of the year despite the ongoing macro uncertainty, our modern approach to unified data storage, which spans data types, price points and hybrid multi-cloud environments is resonating in the market. We are successfully executing against our top priorities, growing in all flash and cloud storage services."", ""We are well positioned with an expanded TAM, including block storage, and new market opportunities like AI to drive continued growth and share gains. We are moving to a higher product margin profile, supported by growth in all-flash products. And we will continue to maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. I'm very pleased with our momentum and very confident in our ability to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. Finally, I want to make you aware of our June 11, Investor Day, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy and business model. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike."", 'Mike Berry: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, all numbers I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Our focus and strong execution again delivered record-setting results, reaching all-time highs across key profitability measures, including consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, net income and EPS. Before I discuss the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As George noted, we continue to see positive results from our new all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we implemented at the start of the fiscal year. The momentum from our industry-leading flash portfolio, coupled with our operational discipline, drove both top and bottom line growth in the quarter.', 'Q3 consolidated gross margin of 73% and product gross margin of 63% and were both at all-time highs for the second consecutive quarter. Gross margin leverage and operating discipline drove operating margin of 30% and EPS of $1.94, both also setting company records for the second consecutive quarter. Q3 operating cash flow came in at $484 million, and free cash flow was $448 million. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least $1.3 billion, tracking relatively in line with net income. The strong execution of our priorities of winning in flash and growing first-party cloud services are clearly paying off. Given our strong execution of results that met or beat our guidance ranges, while driving record-setting profitability measures for the second consecutive quarter, we are once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance.', 'Looking ahead, we are even more confident in our position to drive long-term revenue growth and profitability. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q3 billings increased 7% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, driven by momentum in our all-flash array product families. Hybrid cloud revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and product revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $747 million. Support revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $631 million. We are pleased with the success of moving the responsibility for the majority of our renewals to the customer success team implemented as a part of our go-to-market focus. Public cloud revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $151 million. As expected, growth was driven by our first party and marketplace cloud storage services offset by declines in subscription services.', 'Now for our operating results. Q3 consolidated gross margin was 73%. Gross profit margin dollars increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion driven by strong growth of product gross profit dollars. Q3 product gross margin of 63% was 250 basis points higher than the high-end of our guide, primarily driven by better-than-expected mix shift to all-flash products and pricing discipline in what remains a cost-sensitive environment. Operating expenses of $682 million increased 5% year-over-year and declined slightly from Q2 as expected. As a result of operating leverage and disciplined management, Q3 operating profit dollars increased 30% year-over-year to $485 million and operating margin increased 580 basis points from a year ago to 30%, a record for the second consecutive quarter.', 'EPS grew 42% year-over-year to a record high of $1.94. Our tax rate was 18%, lower than expected due to an adjustment of our full year tax rate. Normalizing for a tax rate of 21.5%, EPS would still have been a record high of $1.86. Q3 operating cash flow of $484 million was up 28% year-over-year, and free cash flow was up 40% year-over-year, driven by solid billings and profitability. DSO was 45% and inventory turns were 14, both consistent with expectations. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $1.1 billion increased 23% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $203 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $526 million in net cash. Year-to-date, we have generated $963 million in free cash flow and returned more than 100% to stockholders.', 'Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q3 was $4.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Before moving to Q4 and fiscal 2024 guidance, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our product gross margin expectations going forward. We have seen the price increases on NAND from suppliers, and these increases will impact all industry participants. The mix shift to our higher-margin all-flash products will partially offset the headwinds from these price increases going forward. As a result of our shift to all-flash, we expect product gross margin to expand to the upper 50% to 60% from our historical norm of approximately 55%.', 'Please note, in any given quarter, commodity prices, product mix, and the pricing environment will cause product gross margin to fluctuate from this new baseline. That being said, I want to make sure to reiterate this point: even with the increase in commodity costs we fully expect our product gross margins to expand to the upper 50% to 60% level driven by the shift to our all-flash portfolio. Now let’s turn to guidance. As George noted, we are pleased with the results of our focus and continued operational discipline. Given our better-than-expected results and our improved outlook for Q4, we are again raising our FY 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $6.185 to $6.335 billion, or $6.26 billion at the midpoint. We expect to see continued strength in all-flash products and Hyperscaler First Party and Marketplace Services.', 'FY 2024 consolidated gross margin is expected to be in the range of 71% to 72%. Product gross margin is expected to be approximately 60%, driven by the continued favorable mix shift to all-flash products. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 27% and EPS to be in the range of $6.40 to $6.50, with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $40 million and share count of 212 million. Our full year tax rate is projected to be 20%. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least, $1.3 billion. In Q4, we expect revenue to range between $1.585 billion and $1.735 billion, which at the midpoint of $1.66 billion implies an increase of 5% year-over-year. We expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71%, and product gross margin to be approximately 60%.', 'Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 27% to 28%. Implied in this guidance, we expect operating expenses to increase from Q3 due mainly to higher incentive compensation, the timing of marketing programs and targeted investment to drive key product roadmap items. Our tax rate is expected to be 20% and EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.83. Also please note that our purchase commitments for NAND for FY 2025 demand will impact our cash flow and balance sheet in Q4, which is included in our updated cash flow forecast and will result in inventory turns to be in the eight to 10 times range. In closing, I want to thank our customers, partners, employees and stockholders for their unwavering commitment and investment in NetApp.', ""We continue to prove our ability to manage the elements within our control and our solid top-line results demonstrate the value that customers realized from our products and services. Our innovative portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments and we remain committed to delivering sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?"", ""Kris Newton: Thanks, Mike.

Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $0.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.96.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Occidental Petroleum investors that purchase the stock on or after the 7th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of April."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.22 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.72 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Occidental Petroleum has a trailing yield of approximately 1.4% on its current stock price of US$61.36.

Occidental Petroleum is paying out just 17% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. The good news is it paid out just 23% of its free cash flow in the last year.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow.

If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's not ideal to see Occidental Petroleum's earnings per share have been shrinking at 4.6% a year over the previous five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Occidental Petroleum's dividend payments per share have declined at 10% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. While it's not great that earnings and dividends per share have fallen in recent years, we're encouraged by the fact that management has trimmed the dividend rather than risk over-committing the company in a risky attempt to maintain yields to shareholders."", ""Is Occidental Petroleum worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share are down meaningfully, although at least the company is paying out a low and conservative percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's definitely not great to see earnings falling, but at least there may be some buffer before the dividend needs to be cut.

You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by the aforementioned Jim Gillies. Jim, thanks for being here."", ""Jim Gillies: Thanks, Ricky for that intro. Let's indeed ask me those questions."", ""Ricky Mulvey: The story this morning that is unavoidable is the Capital One wants Discover. There will be questions among US regulators because headlines are acting like this is a done deal. Let's set the terms out first though. It's a $35 billion all-stock deal. The combo would surpass JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup by credit card volume according to Bloomberg. First and foremost, why does Capital One want this business?"", ""Jim Gillies: Well, they want it. The famous or infamous word, I guess would be scale. Discover is the smallest of the four US major global payment networks, so they're about to get bigger. They want to leverage the investments, they being Capital One, leverages the investments and their network they've put down for the last decades, and they can do that by getting larger very quickly with as you say an all-stock deal. They are claiming and you should always look at these claims with a very healthy shaker of salt, let's put it that way. They're claiming there will be strong returns on invested capital, post-deal synergies totaling about $2.7 billion, I think, through 2027, or it'll take until 2027 to fully realize that. But I think the Empire building is a thing, Ricky, and this is Capital One taking the next step on building their position to challenge the folks, as you mentioned, like JPMorgan and Citigroup."", ""Ricky Mulvey: But the shareholders of Capital One aren't too happy about it, even with these advertised synergies and scale building, they're going to get access to essentially a payment network that they didn't have before, where they had to go out to Visa and MasterCard to get their credit cards out there, and yet they don't seem too happy about it."", ""Jim Gillies: Well, last I saw it was down what one or 2%, Capital One. They're reacting a little bit, or some people are reacting and say, we want to get out of the way of this. I think that's a little silly. Capital One is not richly valued right now. Frankly, I think let's put, it looks pretty decent. I think Discovery is also similarly reasonably valued. Stock Advisor Canada has a recommendation on Discover Financial, for example, and the analyst covering that, Buck Hartzell, is very enthused about the company. I don't think he's terribly thrilled about it going away. It's a scale building, these types of acquisitions do happen all the time, which I suppose is a nice little softball to you to ask about regulatory issues."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's do it."", 'Jim Gillies: There you go.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Usually you do a softball question, not a softball answer for a softball question. But all the headlines are making this sound like it's a done deal from what I've read this morning, and then there's a little bottom paragraph where it's like it still has some regulatory hurdles to clear. There's a lot of big mergers that have been falling apart lately, and it seems like those watching this story, those invested in Discover, like Buck Hartzell, maybe he still has some hope that this could be a stand-alone company."", ""Jim Gillies: On the subject of regulatory approvals or not, look in a world where Amazon buying iRobot can fall apart because of regulatory concerns, admittedly, that was the European Union who were saying, Amazon's going to delist all their rival vacuum folks on their platform and that will hurt iRobot, which is a little silly. But whatever. I have to think that Capital One and Discover who jointly released the press release today, the CEO of Discover is widely quoted in the press release. Three members of the Discover Financial board are going to be joining Capital One board. I would like to think basic due diligence has had both parties run this up the flagpole in terms of legal and probably regulatory expert folks. Now, my take on this is look, again, Discover is the smallest of the big four. Visa, MasterCard, Amex, all much larger than Discover. On the banking side, which is more where Capital One is held."", ""Capital One is like number 10 in the US in terms of total deposits, Discover is at 26. The deal will move them to about number six in the US after of course, the big four, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and I think US Bank is number five. This would move them up to number six, but they'd still be one-third in terms of deposit base. They'd be one-third the size of Citigroup and Wells Fargo, less than one-third, actually. If you prevent this on an anti-competitive basis, you're sending a second message."", ""The second message is the big four are all that matter, and we will block anyone coming to any semblance of scale with the big four. I think that actually would send a worst method. Now it doesn't mean that it won't get regulatory scrutiny, and they might have to hive off one or two things to make it sure. But I think it's not the same, obviously, but Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard, where there was some concerns about that going on there. I think this will take longer than is expected, but I think it will ultimately get done. But that two bucks buys you coffee down the street. What do I know?"", 'Ricky Mulvey: Two bucks at the Capital One cafe.', 'Jim Gillies: There you go.', ""Ricky Mulvey: You get a coffee and do your banking. Let's go to Home Depot earnings. On Friday, JMo made Home Depot radar stock. He said he was going to be curious about the inflationary story, not much of an inflationary story on the call. In fact we have disinflation, which was interestingly brought up. I think it has to do with lumber, but why is disinflation a problem for Home Depot right now?"", ""Jim Gillies: I don't think it is. Disinflation is just a slowing of the rate of inflation. It's not deflation. Disinflation is arguably what we've been doing for the past two years, trying to slow the rate of inflation. That's why we've hiked, we being the federal banks of both of our countries, hiking rates. I don't think it's that much of a problem. I think these companies like Home Depot have seen all manner of economic environments before. I think the long-term investor just looks at this and doesn't particularly care. Investing is an expectations game, and expectations, they were already set, they were going to be light. They've been light for the last year. They'd be light again this year. But you knew they were going to be light. I think I am going to go in a bit of a sermon here. I know, act shocked. Home Depot is probably one of my favorite, if not my favorite case study for a company that transitions from growth mode to cash-cow. No one noticed."", ""They noticed, but 16 years ago now. In fiscal 2008, which their fiscal year is ending in February, it's always weird. This is a company that had been in major growth mode. They've been growing their store base by somewhat like 8% a year or somewhat like that before that and 2008, they only did about two-and-a-half billion, $2.2 billion in free cash flow in that last year of growth mode, and their store count was like just over $2,200, and their capex was $3.6 billion, which is actually higher than what the most recent is. Today, the store count has gone nowhere. I think they've grown at 0.3% annually for the last 16 years, but cash flow has exploded. Home Depot is a story of a dominant company in, effectively, an oligopoly. Lowes, you can argue it's an oligopoly. Yes, there's mom-and-pop hardware stores everywhere, but whatever."", ""They've turned into cash flow mode, and the cash flow exploded. The last 16 years since they went from rapid store growth, plow all their cash flow into growing the store count to, we're just going to do maintenance, very slow growth that they're calling for 12 stores this year. They're probably going to close a couple as well, so net store growth probably won't be 12. They have produced $143 billion in free cash flow for the past 16 years. They have thrown all of it at share buybacks, which has reduced the share count by 41%, and ever-rising dividends, they've just jacked their dividend to nine dollars a share for this coming year. When they stopped their major growth trajectory, like I said in 2008, they were at $0.90 a share. They've 10-folded their dividend."", ""On a dividend-adjusted basis over the past 16 years, Home Depot, mature giant cash-cow company, has given investors 20% annualized returns. Please tell me again, though, I know there's a bunch of growth-focused investors who like to say, when this happens, it's a sign of a company maturing and all the good stuff has gone. It's been about 16 years, 20% annualized. I'm picking a straw man, obviously. But please tell me how much better the new growth changing the world has done over the 20% annualized put up for the past 16 years at poky no-growth Home Depot, who still has their competitive position unchanged by the way. I go on, I'll wait."", ""Ricky Mulvey: They offered. I want to meet this straw man who's ready to go to town on Home Depot."", ""Jim Gillies: I can give you a name or two, but we'll talk after the show."", ""Ricky Mulvey: What you just described is why Home Depot is able to essentially offer a soft forecast and the stock does not flinch. That's always the story. Earnings beat expectations, stock forecast is down and then the stock gets pummeled. Let's go to Griffon Corp, which is a story you haven't heard. It's not going to be in the headline of today's show. But we're Slacking this morning, and I offer up some stories, you give some takes on it. You wanted to talk about, and I'm quoting now, a maker of fine residential and commercial garage roll-up doors in garden rakes run by a well-comped, in-depth artistic management team."", 'Jim Gillies: Guilty as charged.', 'Ricky Mulvey: I was like, we can talk about some other things, but I feel like Jim wants to talk about this story. This is an activist story, seems like the activist plays worked out. Give us the story with Griffon Corp here.', ""Jim Gillies: Sure. Yes, Griffon Corp is that very thing. They are well-comped. One of the reasons why the activist Voss Capital showed up a couple of years ago is, do you see what these guys are getting paid basically? They pointed to a myriad of compensation plans that seem to basically need a pulse, and they'd be met in full. In fact, the pulse might be optional on a couple of them. They pointed out Voss Capital, that is pointed out that the CEO, who is a gentleman, Rob Kramer. I believe his name is the CEO and Chairman that he made more for this tiny little company. I think today it's barely a four billion dollar company. Again, they make roll-up doors, garage doors, garden rakes, garden hose. They own the Hunter Douglas fan, the old ceiling fan brand. That guy made more than the CEOs of some other companies you've heard of one, we've already talked about Home Depot, Starbucks, and Disney."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Old Bobby? Your favorite entertainment CEO, Bob Iger?', ""Jim Gillies: I was going to say, I'm going to hold off on the Bob Iger love [laughs] right now. They said the board was compromised, was full of cronies. I came to the story about a year into the activist fight. They already had one fight and they were calling for a division to be sold off. I recommended it in Hidden Gems Canada in January of 2023, and I think one market day later, they announced the deal with the activist because I was gearing up for another fight and I love a lot of good activist fight. They announced that the head of Voss Capital, who'd already got one of their directors onto the board anyway, in the previous fight, they were announcing that the the lead for Voss Capital was himself joining the board, and they announced the standstill agreement."", ""We're all going to work together and kumbaya, and we're going to bring it everything together. We're going to create shareholder value for people. They sold off the previous division, but they were in the middle of a strategic review. That strategic review disappointed everyone except apparently me when it came out a couple of months later because everyone is expecting a sale of the company. Instead, it came out that, we're going to give you two dollars a share, special dividend, and we're going to up our buyback program. Stock promptly fell from the mid 30s to the mid 20s, very nice time to add by the way. But since then they've paid that special dividend, they've hiked the regular dividend twice. They have indeed been very aggressive in operational improvements that has led to more cash flow and that cash flow is lead to better buybacks, a little bit of debt repayment."", ""They got serious about board refreshment, so they actually got rid of a couple of the directors who had been there for forever and ever. The reason I call them nepotistic as the CEO is the son-in-law of the former CEO who himself was the son of the former CEO before him. I'm not scared by that kind of stuff because frankly, I think when you have people so nakedly looking out for their own self-interest, maybe who view to align yourself with their self-interest. But the thing that came out this morning that I think is kind of the end of the activist story. So why Griffon is going forward, is going to have to earn its place in your portfolio based on performance alone, is the word came out that Voss Capital is selling 1.5 million shares to Griffon themselves at a 3% discount to the market. So that's nice, I like that. But this will take their holdings from about 2.8-2.9 million shares down by 1.5 million."", ""It'll take them below the 5% threshold where you have to report, and the lead of Voss Capital is leaving the board. Now, they gave all the right words and said we're going to keep on owning shares. However, they can now sell without needing to file a form for the rest of their holdings, so it'll be interesting. But this is a stock again, Griffon Corp, maker of garage doors and yard implements. The stock is up. Basically, it's a double over the past year. It's up about 120%, if you did take the conclusion of the strategic review as a buy signal, that's about nine months ago. If I can be said to try anything, it's, I like to preach that you can make market beating returns in odd and weird places. You don't have to go for whatever is super-hyped in in the media at this time. You can find it in Home Depot as we talked about. You can find it in people who sell stuff to Home Depot, like Griffon Corp. So I thought it was an interesting story that most Motley Fool Money listeners probably haven't heard of."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Well. I think we just hit the SMCI story with that as well, so we're about out of time, Jim Gillies.

There a lot that I can put on this list. My recency bias is going to bring Nvidia here front and center. I'll go with Nvidia because it's funny. One of my roles here, I'm the advisor for Augmented Reality and Beyond service, and when i started that service almost five years ago, Nvidia was one of the stocks I recommended. They made a lot of sense at the time and I remember digging into the company thinking, these guys are coming around and doing a lot of cool stuff. This is a stock I really probably want to own. As I mentioned before on the previous episode, we have internal trading guidelines that make it a little bit tricky sometimes for us, just people transact whenever we want."", ""So it was just never a stock that was open. It was never available for me to actually go in there and purchase, so I didn't at the time it sort of left my mind and never thought about it. Five years later, it's up like 2,000%. Now, I'm thrilled that I've got it on the card for our members because our members have clearly one big from Nvidia. That's one where I looked back and I think, man, I should've just kept that on my radar and I just didn't catch it. I wish, I did because I feel like they still got a lot to do."", ""Robert Brokamp: I'll just add a little bit about the training guidelines for people who are curious. That is, once The Motley Fool has recommended or discuss the stock, we are as employees prevented from buying it for I don't know what it is 10 days or something like that. Then also if you own it and you want to sell it, you have to check and see if we've mentioned it, recommend you can't sell it. It does limit a little bit of the investment flexibility of working here."", ""Alison Southwick: Bill, how about for you? What's the one that got away?"", ""Bill Mann: I read this assignment as something that I had recommended for members and had never gotten around to buying myself, and the answer was a company that I loved the moment that I recommended it and never went back and bought it. It was a company called TransDigm, which since that point in time, and I looked this up and it was painful to do so it's up 4,500%."", 'Robert Brokamp: Oh, goodness gracious.', ""Bill Mann: TransDigm, what they do is they make basically all of the parts inside of an airplane tube. The tube itself is Boeing or Airbus, but all of the components inside are built by other companies. By other companies, I basically mean TransDigm. They did almost everything else inside Boeing planes.

That's Under Armour. Under Armour is one that had?"", 'Bill Mann: I dated Under Armour too.', ""Jason Moser: So much potential. We saw that stretch of time where Kevin Plank really seemed to have the answer for everything and then they just hit a wall and it was self-inflicted errors. I mean, he just made some strategic blunders. I think that really sent the company into a not a death spiral, but certainly something that's been very difficult for them to recover from. Thankfully it was a smaller position. It's not something that was naturally material to my portfolio. It was one where I was considering, maybe this is one we need to keep building this out. This could be the next Nike-like story until it became apparent that it probably wasn't going to be so. To be clear, I still own those shares today. It's a small, meaningless position, but I was telling you before about I default and not selling. The funny thing is, I think Under Armour makes great stuff, I'm wearing Under Armour pants. I mean, I love them. They just can't get that business in order. It's really interesting to watch. I remember before Bill, how we would talk about Lululemon versus Under Armour. I mean, all of these."", ""Bill Mann: Nobody's talking about that anymore."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. It's just, it's fascinating to see how well Lululemon's performed while watching Under Armour just completely flounder. It's been a real lesson."", ""Alison Southwick: What's been a difference you think?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, I think certainly just vision and leadership. Leadership with Under Armour, they've just never had any kind of consistent vision as to what they wanted to do with the business and recovering from those strategic blunders that Plank made long ago and most of that was in regards to supply chain management. It's just been a difficult road for him."", ""Bill Mann: I'm still completely distracted by the fact that you used the word brodie. [laughs]"", 'Robert Brokamp: To the max even, to the max. [laughs]', ""Bill Mann: Yeah. I think it's meaningful that off the top of your head know exactly the name of the founder of Under Armour and don't know the founder of Lululemon. They have a much more professional management."", 'Jason Moser: Was that Chip Wilson?', 'Bill Mann: Yeah.', 'Jason Moser: Now Wilson is out of the picture.', 'Alison Southwick: Wilson was a bit problematic.', 'Robert Brokamp: Arguably controversial.', ""Jason Moser: I'll argue a little bit out there. I don't know that much about him, but it was very clear that there were like, look we got to part ways and get this thing back on track. Under Armour has not had that luxury because Plank is still the majority owner of that business. Split those shares out. He's controlling the whole thing. I mean, I think we could argue that's a bad move and clearly investors have loss from that."", ""Bill Mann: I'm not suggesting that Wilson was the one that got away by the way. [laughs] I am simply saying that they had a professional management team and structure in place whereas with Under Armour, Kevin Plank's basically up their Napoleon style pointing here, we go there. If you're going to be a Napoleon, you'd better bring it and he hasn't."", ""Alison Southwick: What's the stock that broke your heart, Bill?"", ""Bill Mann: Mine's Kahoot."", 'Alison Southwick: Kahoot?', 'Bill Mann: You know Kahoot. The little Kahoots, the quizzes that basically?', 'Alison Southwick: Yeah, I know Kahoot.', 'Bill Mann: Got your kids 80% of the learning they did during the pandemic.', 'Alison Southwick: Yeah, the little quizzes.', ""Bill Mann: It was a great little company and we recommended it almost when it was pre-revenue. They were building up their business, didn't even have a marketing team. It was all word of mouth and just exploding. It was one of those companies that simply and I wouldn't take the other side of this, I wouldn't want the other experience, but it was one of those companies that really took hold during the pandemic and then lost its grip on the other side. Again, I don't wish we were still in the pandemic so that Kahoot would be doing well, but it's such a company with a purpose that I really wanted it to financially succeed more than it has."", ""Alison Southwick: Our last question is for you all. Now, this was the one that got Jason squirming in his seats, so we'll see if if it's true. The one time you cheated, by which we mean an investment that generally goes against your principles or what you've recommended to readers and listeners here."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, I think the reason why I squirm is because I look at these tickers and I'm like, yeah, they're not working out and yet I still own them and I don't know why. Oftentimes, I own them because, I either I'm holding out hope that things will turn around, or they serve as living lessons and reminders. I think in this case these are reminders. One of the rules I tend to espouse, and I follow it for the most part but every once in a while I stray, is to just not buy into IPOs, give it some time. I like to see four quarters of reporting. I want to understand how this management team works. What they're focused on, how they report, metrics."", ""Every once in a while I do stray and two that standout, I'll give you two here, Eventbrite and Unity Software, a couple of companies that I bought into early on in their public lives. They just struck me as interesting businesses with a lot of potential. I didn't worry so much about the valuations and the enthusiasm behind this stuff. Because with IPOs, that can often be a drawback as the enthusiasm that's there pushes those valuations up a little bit irrationally. Especially so in the case of Unity Software, given the time that it went public, but Eventbrite and Unity stand out to me as two where I should've listened to myself. I didn't. Maybe things will get better for them, but I'm not terribly optimistic at this point."", 'Alison Southwick: Bill, how about you?', ""Bill Mann: I have a basic rule and it is this, don't leave your money at risk of dictators."", ""Alison Southwick: We're getting back to Napoleon again."", ""Bill Mann: We are getting back to Napoleon again. I have a second rule and it is if the person who is running a company seems like a bad person, they are probably a bad person. I had recommended a company called JD.com, which is a Chinese company. It's a very interesting company, a clone of Amazon. Their CEO got in trouble with the law in a very bad way in Minnesota in I think 2019."", 'Alison Southwick: What was he doing in Minnesota?', 'Bill Mann: Getting in trouble.', 'Alison Southwick: You can get in that much trouble in Minnesota?', 'Robert Brokamp: Yeah. I went to a seminary in Minnesota and I had to storage.', ""Bill Mann: I don't know how to respond to that. But go on."", 'Alison Southwick: We will save that for another episode.', ""Jason Moser: You've left him speechless."", ""Bill Mann: Was arrested for messing around with a woman who was not his wife. You know what I mean? I found myself a little bit frozen by what do I do because we as analysts are supposed to focus on a business and you don't want to overreact to things, but you don't want to under-react to them either. In this case, given everything else about what was happening in China, the fact that it's not a particularly friendly environment to foreign capital, I should have just pulled the plug and just got out and said, listen, this is not a place where we need to risk our money. We have thousands of companies that we can invest in. Why would we remain exposed to this one?"", ""Alison Southwick: Let's close on a more optimistic note."", ""Bill Mann: Thank you. I really didn't want that to be the end."", ""Alison Southwick: No, we are going to close on an optimistic note here. Moser and Bill, is there any stock right now that you're maybe slipping notes to in-class and do you like me? Yes, no, maybe? Maybe a stock on your radar?"", ""Robert Brokamp: Of course, if you talk about it, then you can't buy it."", 'Bill Mann: What have I already mentioned?', ""Jason Moser: Well, I so yes, there is one that, I've recommended it in my Next-Gen Supercycle service and it's performed very well in a very short period of time. It's a company called Samsara and ultimately in connected Cloud operation, helping businesses connect all of their devices and vehicles and buildings and stuff like that. Samsara builds that technology, runs all the software behind it. The ticker is IOT, which is clever because of Internet of Things and all of that stuff, so it's an Internet of things kind of play. Speaking evaluation, the stock has taken off. The valuation is one where I'm like, it needs to come back to me before I can really start getting serious about those love letters. We're going from the notes to love letters. That's what I'm hoping. But that's one that I continue to really be be interested in."", 'Alison Southwick: IOT. Bill, how about you?', ""Bill Mann: Jason talks about all this technology. I'd like to talk shoes for a minute."", ""Jason Moser: We all got to wear shoes, I guess we don't all have to. We're all doing."", ""Bill Mann: We're all requested to wear shoes lots of times. Not that long ago, I was in Japan and was walking in a very fashionable part of Tokyo. There were all these little boutiques and one had a line going around the block. As an investor, that's the thing that makes me go, huh. The company was On Holdings, the running shoe company. No, they call themselves a movement company."", 'Alison Southwick: How do you spell that, O-N?', ""Bill Mann: Yeah, ON. The people will have heard of this even if you have not. It is a Swiss company co-invested by Roger Federer. The guy who founded it was a former triathlete who noticed that other triathletes were suffering from the same exact injuries and decided to try and develop a shoe that would be safer for people. They're fantastically comfortable. They very fetchingly called their technology Cloud technology, which is a great sounding thing for your feet. They're selling off like wildfire. A little bit of a challenging valuation, but in the very same way that Lululemon has always had a challenging valuation.

All four of these magnificent healthcare companies have solid business models, upwardly trending share prices, and, unfortunately, somewhat frothy valuations.', ""But they also have very long growth runways and a history of good execution, so there's a solid chance that their price tags will be justified by continued strong performance.

Not convinced that their trajectories are in line with magnificence? Consider this chart below. As you can see, they're ramping up sharply, and they're worth buying if you don't mind their valuations."", 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) is a drug developer focusing on rare diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF). Recently, it commercialized a new gene therapy called Casgevy for both sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta thalassemia with the help of CRISPR Therapeutics. Its market cap is $111 billion.

Third, they generally boast excellent growth prospects.', 'Now, suppose we wanted to create a ""Magnificent Seven"" list in the biotech industry. Which companies would make the cut? I have no doubt that the following three drugmakers would feature prominently: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO).', 'As the graph above shows, the worst-performing stock of these three biotech leaders over the past decade is Vertex Pharmaceuticals, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7%.', ""Eli Lilly's CAGR of 32.1% is the best, while Novo Nordisk's 20.2% annual return comes in second. In the same period, the biotech industry -- as measured by the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF, an index fund tracking it -- delivered a CAGR of 5.5%, nowhere close to the performance of those three biotech giants. Even the S&P 500's 12.8% falls far short of the worst-performing among our biotech trio."", 'So, Vertex, Eli Lilly, and Novo Nordisk meet the first requirement of a Magnificent Seven of biotech stocks.', 'Vertex, Lilly, and Novo Nordisk all dominate their most important markets.', ""Let's start with Vertex. The company's success over the past 10 years is due to its dominance in the market for therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF). No other company in the world sells medicines that treat the underlying conditions of this rare disease, which affects patients' internal organs, and it's not like Vertex's competitors haven't tried. Vertex has a monopoly that grants it substantial pricing power."", ""The biotech has also been able to develop newer and better CF medicines. In 2019, Vertex earned approval for Trikafta, a drug that can treat up to 90% of CF patients. The biotech is still working on improving its CF lineup. It recently reported results from a phase 3 study for its next combo treatment, which, among other things, comes with a convenient once-daily dosing (Trikafta is taken twice a day). In short, Vertex's dominance here is far from over."", ""Turning to Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, the duo have long competed in the market for diabetes therapies, where they are the two leading players. More recently, Lilly and Novo Nordisk have become famous for their anti-obesity medicines. Novo Nordisk's Ozempic is likely the most famous of the bunch, but Eli Lilly earned approval for Zepbound last year, which proved even more effective than Ozempic. Still, both medicines should increase their sales rapidly in the coming years."", ""Let's now consider what the future holds for these three biotech leaders. Vertex has sought to diversify its lineup, and succeeded. It recently earned approval for a gene-editing therapy called Casgevy that treats the blood disorders sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia."", 'Vertex also recorded positive results from a phase 3 study of VX-548, a potential treatment for acute neuropathic pain. The company has several other mid- and late-stage pipeline programs, so it should be able to continue delivering rapidly growing revenue and earnings.', 'Meanwhile, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk will benefit from the fast-growing market for anti-obesity drugs. Some analysts think this niche will hit sales of about $44 billion by 2030, up from $2.5 billion in 2022.', 'Ozempic and Zepbound should earn key label expansions in other areas, too. Both are targeting the potentially highly lucrative nonalcoholic steatohepatitis market. The former recorded excellent results in treating kidney disease in diabetes patients, while the latter is also being investigated in obstructive sleep apnea.', ""Furthermore, Eli Lilly's lineup and pipeline include important medicines in other areas, including cancer drug Verzenio, immunosuppressant Taltz, and donanemab, which could earn the green light this year in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Novo Nordisk is expanding its lineup, too, with programs for SCD, AD, and various rare diseases; it's also close to an approval for icodec, a once-weekly insulin product."", 'So all three of these biotechs seem to have excellent outlooks. That\'s why the market continues to reward them. There is no official ""Magnificent Seven"" for biotech stocks yet. But if there were, it would be hard to come up with a better trio to lead the pack.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $89.29 in the previous session. Textron has gained 10.8% since the start of the year compared to the -1.2% move for the Zacks Aerospace sector and the -3.7% return for the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry.', ""What's Driving the Outperformance?"", ""The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 24, 2024, Textron reported EPS of $1.6 versus consensus estimate of $1.53 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0.65%."", 'For the current fiscal year, Textron is expected to post earnings of $6.15 per share on $14.64 billion in revenues. This represents a 10.02% change in EPS on a 7% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.99 per share on $15.6 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 13.63% and 6.57%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'Textron may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""Textron has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 14.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 17.8X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 11.5X versus its peer group's average of 12.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.23. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', 'We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Textron currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.', 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Textron meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Textron shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.', 'How Does TXT Stack Up to the Competition?', 'Shares of TXT have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS). LDOS has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of C.', 'Earnings were strong last quarter. Leidos Holdings, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 15.03%, and for the current fiscal year, LDOS is expected to post earnings of $7.63 per share on revenue of $15.96 billion.', 'Shares of Leidos Holdings, Inc. have gained 15.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 16.75X and a P/CF of 9.09X.', 'The Aerospace - Defense industry is in the top 35% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for TXT and LDOS, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It also wants to replace CEO Alan Shaw with former UPS executive Jim Barber and name Jamie Boychuk, a former executive at CSX, to replace current COO Paul Duncan.', 'That fight now has the Pennsylvania derailment as part of the battle, and Ancora wasted no time Saturday coming out with a statement over the incident.', '“Our proposed slate and management team are unanimous in their view that Norfolk Southern must become a safer and more reliable railroad before it can ever reach its full potential,” Ancora said in the statement. “Following this latest derailment, we call for the immediate termination of CEO Alan Shaw and stand ready to engage with the Company about an orderly reconstitution of the Board and a transition to capable management with a track record of actually delivering on safety commitments.”', 'The statement went on to say that “an incident like this, which is drawing national news coverage and resulting in more embarrassment for the railroad, should put an end to the Board’s unsustainable efforts to save a tainted CEO with no long-term future.3 How can anyone defend this?”', 'According to news reports, the derailment took place in Lower Saucon Township, which is near the Allentown-Bethlehem area. There were no reports of injuries, although diesel fuel being carried in a tank car did spill, there were no reports of contamination or evacuations. Plastic pellets also spilled, according to the news reports.', 'In a statement provided to FreightWaves on Sunday, a spokesperson said: “Norfolk Southern crews and contractors remain at the derailment site. Members of the NTSB have arrived and are investigating. Once they have completed their investigation of the scene, we will continue with site cleanup and begin work to restore the track. The area where the locomotives were in the water will remain contained with booms until any residual sheen has been removed.”', 'Saturday’s derailment comes after two days of back-and-forth over two of the U.S.-based Class 1 railroads that left heads spinning. The scorecard for the criticism and the responses went like this:', '— Martin Oberman, chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, ripped into Ancora Associates for its proxy battle over Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) railroad. Oberman spoke to the Southeast Association of Rail Shippers 2024 Spring Meeting in Atlanta on Thursday, where he said Ancora “has nothing to say about what it could do better” than current management in running Norfolk Southern, adding, “I think we can assume that if Ancora succeeds in its bid to control NS, its next move will be to put the Brooklyn Bridge on the market.”', '— Ancora didn’t have any public response to Oberman’s comments, but on Friday, it sent a letter to the Norfolk Southern board, just a few days after the railroad released its 2024 proxy statement. The proxy revealed that in 2023 — the year when Norfolk Southern labored under the fallout from the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio — NS CEO Alan Shaw had total compensation of $13.41 million, compared to $9.78 million a year before.', '— The second blast from a government official aimed at a railroad came from Amit Bose, the administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration. In a letter addressed to UP CEO Jim Vena,', 'Bose criticized recent furloughs implemented at Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP). “It is imperative that UP prioritizes safety above all else and takes immediate steps to address this issue, an issue disproportionately affecting UP workers since your railroad continues to furlough employees at a rate, based on available data, far outpacing that of any of your Class I peers.” Bose wrote.', '— Union Pacific quickly responded to Bose’s comments with a letter from Vena, which said the FRA head was portraying an “inaccurate correlation between natural workforce fluctuations and safety.”', 'Oberman was harsh in his assessment of Ancora’s motives. “Several weeks ago, Ancora wrote me a letter,” Oberman said, according to a transcript released by the STB. “The essence of their message was that they had taken a $1 billion dollar stake in NS in order for it — quote — ‘to become a safer railroad.’ Really? What hedge fund raises $1 billion to promote safety anywhere?”', 'Oberman, as he has done before, criticized railroad focus on its operating ratio (OR), with the STB head expressing concern that a goal to reduce OR can come at the expense of both safety and performance.', '“Ancora principally and repeatedly focuses on a rapid lowering of the OR to drive cash payouts and raise its stock price, harshly criticizing present NS management for not making a lower OR the objective,” Oberman said. “We now know that this is wrong-headed thinking. Making OR the corporate objective is what led to elimination of thousands of workers which caused the service crisis.”', 'The reference to the service crisis was from earlier in his speech when he recapped STB actions to force service improvements during the enormous system backups of 2022.\xa0', 'Ancora’s Friday letter was addressed to Amy Miles, the non-executive chair of the NS board.\xa0 The letter said that Ancora — which as an activist investor has previously trained its sights on Forward Air (NASDAQ: FWRD) and C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) — said Shaw has “presided over industry-worst operating results, sustained share price underperformance and an ineffective and tone-deaf response to the preventable derailment in East Palestine.” It said Anchor had “offered viable solutions in the form of exceptional people with a strategic vision.”', 'Norfolk Southern’s stock price in the last 52 weeks is up about 14%. During that time, its fierce rival for business east of the Mississippi, CSX (NASDAQ: CSX), is up about 23.7% while Union Pacific is up 21.5%.', 'On the issue of Shaw’s pay, the Ancora letter said shareholders were “baffled” at the decision to give the CEO a raise in the same year as the East Palestine derailment and the fallout from it.', '“We challenge the Board’s determination that it had to adjust executive compensation in 2023 to', '‘retain key talent,’” Ancora said, quoting a board statement. “We do not see how the Board could have actually viewed Mr. Shaw as a flight risk. In addition to being a more than 30-year insider at Norfolk Southern, he was a relatively new, unproven CEO off to an extremely rocky start. The fact that this decision was made suggests deference to management and a lack of respect for shareholders and stakeholders.”', 'In the back-and-forth surrounding Union Pacific, Bose said UP’s decision to furlough some worker is a sign that the railroad “has again chosen to prioritize cost-cutting measures over ensuring safe operations, jeopardizing the well-being of both UP’s workers and the public.”', '“Furloughing maintenance of equipment workers puts a strain on workers across the railroad, leading to fatigue and potential errors that could have severe ramifications for both workers and the public,” Bose wrote.', 'In a letter signed by Vena, UP responded to Bose’s criticism with several key rebuttals.', '— It cited several statistical points about derailments, that “serious” derailments were down 26% in 2023 from 2019 levels, track-related derailments had declined 28% in the past 10 years, and that UP had recorded an 8.7% improvement in mainline derailments in 2023 versus 2021.', '— The Vena letter said “fluctuations in workforce needs are a natural component of operating the railroad … normal, cyclical and vary from year to year based on business needs, capital projects and weather.”', 'To support its criticism that Bose was not making distinctions among types of workers and railroad needs, Vena’s response said the Bose letter “combines different types of workers (Mechanical employees and Engineering employees) and work done on the railroad (equipment maintenance and capital projects), and therefore paints an incorrect and incomplete picture of the natural role workforce fluctuations play in operating a railroad year-round.”', '“We’ve already begun seeing an increase in demand and have more employees working in January and February of this year,” Vena wrote.', 'The letter also said workers impacted by furloughs and layoffs can apply for other positions at Union Pacific.', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'If truckers haul bread and cakes, is their business baking or trucking?', 'Deadline near for filings as Werner seeks review of nuclear verdict', 'Live on stage: The complex relationship between a trucking job and life', 'The post Amid debate over rail safety concerns, another Norfolk Southern train derails appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

Peachtree Street NWAtlanta, Georgia 30308', 'Dear Amy,', 'Prior to publicly disclosing our slate of director candidates and proposed management team, the Investor Group spent more than two months privately providing you and your fellow directors with data and facts that demonstrated the urgent need for meaningful change at Norfolk Southern. We made clear that your current CEO has presided over industry-worst operating results, sustained share price underperformance and an ineffective and tone-deaf response to the preventable derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. We also exposed the impractical elements of management’s go-forward strategy and spotlighted persistent issues with respect to safety, as evidenced by this year’s new derailments and the recent death of an engineer. As these points were raised, we offered viable solutions in the form of exceptional people with a strategic vision for delivering better service, enhanced safety, improved growth and stronger value creation. We even offered to settle for minority representation on the Board in the event the Company initiated an orderly management change.', 'Although we were initially disappointed with the Board’s dismissiveness, the Company’s recently filed proxy statement and ongoing low-road smear campaign against us have clarified a great deal. It appears that the Board is serving at the pleasure of CEO Alan Shaw – rather than the other way around. But with each passing day of disruptive fear mongering and transparently manufactured attacks on our people, we contend that current leadership is simply sealing its fate with the shareholders to whom it owes fiduciary duties. Norfolk Southern’s owners, who appear to share our view that a railroad should be pro-labor, safe and value-generating all at once, recognize the playbook being run.', 'We ask that the Board reflect on the points below before continuing to spend Norfolk Southern’s money, time and reputational currency on a scorched-earth campaign that will forever be associated with the incumbent directors.', 'I. Shareholders are confounded by the Board’s decision to award Mr. Shaw a raise for 2023.', 'It is astonishing to us that the Board would reward Mr. Shaw with a 37% increase in the value of compensation to a total of $13.4 million for a year in which the Company’s customers, employees, shareholders and community partners all suffered.1 This figure includes more than $10 million in stock and option awards, which were granted to Mr. Shaw even though he missed all six annual incentive targets pertaining to financial performance, customer service and safety.2 To add insult to injury, Mr. Shaw appears to be a major beneficiary of the ""East Palestine Adjustment"" that increased Performance Stock Unit payout percentages from 56% to 96.3% of target.3', 'We challenge the Board’s determination that it had to adjust executive compensation in 2023 to ""retain key talent.""4 We do not see how the Board could have actually viewed Mr. Shaw as a flight risk. In addition to being a more than 30-year insider at Norfolk Southern, he was a relatively new, unproven CEO off to an extremely rocky start. The fact that this decision was made suggests concerning deference to management and a lack of respect for shareholders and stakeholders.', 'While we recognize policymakers will not determine the outcome of the vote at the Annual Meeting, we are nonetheless surprised that the Board made a compensation decision that is a direct affront to President Joe Biden’s recent comments about greed and a lack of accountability at Norfolk Southern.5 There are numerous examples of boards of directors taking the responsible step of reducing – not raising – executive pay following disasters. In situations we deem comparable to the East Palestine derailment, like BP p.l.c.’s 2010 oil spill and The Boeing Company’s 737 MAX accidents, boards of directors typically terminate or hold the CEO accountable. To the contrary, Norfolk Southern’s Board instead rewarded its CEO with a massive pay raise, elevating his compensation to more than 100x that of the median employee.6', 'II. Shareholders are concerned the Board is pursuing a scorched-earth campaign that involves poisoning the well with key stakeholders of the railroad.', 'Norfolk Southern is a beacon of American commerce due to its exceptional employees, strong customer base and storied brand. This is one of the primary reasons why we were able to attract director candidates and proposed executives who have achieved tremendous success over the course of their careers in the public and private sectors. Amongst this collection of high-integrity individuals, there is a unanimous view that neither side should go into the gutter during an election contest. There was an assumption that the Company’s Board, which includes highly respected individuals like Admiral Philip Davidson (retired) and Thomas C. Kelleher, would share our view.', 'Unfortunately, you have not responded to our prior private letter that encouraged Norfolk Southern to avoid poisoning the well with valued stakeholders. You have also failed to address our concerns about the manner in which Norfolk Southern appears to be sending private planes to Washington, D.C. and misrepresenting our views to regulators. You, as Chair, and Mr. Shaw, as CEO, are no doubt aware that our published materials reveal no emphasis on cost cutting, headcount reductions or short-sighted tactics. To the contrary, our slate and proposed management team have repeatedly committed to pursuing stronger growth and implementing a network strategy that will leverage Norfolk Southern’s existing assets. We find it extremely disingenuous for the Company to miscast our intentions, especially since Mr. Shaw stated during 4Q23 earnings that Norfolk Southern’s ""cost structure is too high.""7 For the avoidance of doubt, our network strategy accounts for responsible cost management and the principles of scheduled railroading – just like Mr. Shaw’s resilience strategy, as can be seen in numerous public statements.', 'When it comes to safety, you and Mr. Shaw are also undoubtedly aware of what we have committed to. Our proposed CEO, Jim Barber, believes the health and safety of the Company’s constituencies is the bedrock of long-term success. Our proposed COO, Jamie Boychuk, helped CSX dramatically improve customer service and go roughly two-and-a-half years without any work-related fatalities. They firmly believe that the health and safety of Norfolk Southern’s people and communities are the highest priorities. Mr. Barber plans to leverage his background overseeing nationwide networks to bring new risk management technologies and initiatives to Norfolk Southern. He and Mr. Boychuk have a shared vision for employee-led safety committees and establishing programs that reward and spotlight worker contributions to the Company’s harm reduction agenda. Our slate and proposed management team know a better-run Norfolk Southern will have the financial power to invest more in safety and service, while enabling employees to benefit from the prosperity of the railroad.', 'The more you direct your agents and surrogates to publicize inaccurate information about the Investor Group, the more it looks like incumbent leadership has no track record or viable plans of its own to run on.', 'III. Shareholders want an election contest to be defined by facts and ideas.', 'Please recognize that Norfolk Southern’s shareholders, who seem to have no appetite for campaigns built on incessant smears, are the ones who will ultimately determine which slate is elected at the Annual Meeting. Please know that we are going to run a contest defined by a transparent articulation of facts and ideas. This means we are going to be publicly critical of leadership’s business mistakes when they can be cited and documented. This also means we are going to be candid about our slate’s transition plan and strategy, including their components and targets.', 'To avoid destabilizing the Company more than it already has been over the past 12 months, we urge you to reduce your reliance on advisors and shadow games in favor of starting to run a high-road contest focused on track records and plans. And, to the extent you want to reengage with us about a settlement framework that accounts for Board refreshment and orderly management changes, we are here to have private conversations. Either way, you and your fellow directors owe it to Norfolk Southern and all of its stakeholders to run a campaign befitting of this great organization.', 'Sincerely,', 'Jim Chadwick, on behalf of the Investor Group', '***', 'About Ancora', 'Founded in 2003, Ancora Holdings Group, LLC offers integrated investment advisory, wealth management, retirement plan services and insurance solutions to individuals and institutions across the United States.

Following its portfolio has helped many investors stay ahead of the market."", ""But with the S&P 500 currently hovering near its all-time high, investors might be a bit wary of loading up on the Oracle of Omana's top stocks. However, I believe it's still safe to buy Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), which together account for approximately 54% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Let's find out a bit more about these three no-brainer Buffett stocks."", ""Apple's stock price is down about 5% this year as investors fret over its slowing iPhone sales, declining Mac shipments, and a lack of near-term catalysts. It still generates over half of its revenue from the iPhone, the Vision Pro remains a pricey niche gadget, and it recently ditched its plans to build an electric car."", ""As a result, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to only grow 1% and 7%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 (which ends this September). Those growth rates seem tepid for a stock that trades at 28 times forward earnings."", 'Berkshire Hathaway notably sold about $2 billion of its Apple shares in the fourth quarter of 2023, but the tech giant still accounts for 44.5% of its portfolio. During Berkshire\'s annual meeting last year, Buffett praised Apple as a ""better business than any we own"" and said that if its customers ""had to give up a second car or give up their iPhone, they\'d give up their second car.""', ""Buffett is still bullish on Apple because it has tremendous pricing power, it's bought back 36% of its shares over the past 10 years, and it ended its latest quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities, which gives it plenty of room to expand its ecosystem with fresh investments and acquisitions. All of those strengths should justify its higher valuation and make it a great safe-haven stock to own in this volatile market -- even if it doesn't blast off over the next few quarters."", ""Berkshire Hathaway has owned Coca-Cola's shares since the late 1980s. Buffett once claimed to drink at least five 12-ounce cans of Coke each day, and the world's largest soda maker still accounts for 6.5% of Berkshire's portfolio."", ""Coca-Cola might seem like a risky stock to buy as soda consumption rates decline across the world, but it's diversified its portfolio with more brands of bottled water, fruit juices, teas, sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee, and even alcoholic beverages over the past few decades to curb its long-term dependence on sugary sodas. It's also refreshed its carbonated drinks with healthier versions, smaller serving sizes, and new flavors."", ""In 2023, Coca-Cola's organic revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 12% and 8%, respectively. For 2024, it expects its organic revenue to rise 6% to 7% as its adjusted EPS increases 4% to 5% -- even as tough currency headwinds throttle its overseas growth. It's also raised its dividend annually for 61 consecutive years, pays a forward yield of 3.2%, and looks reasonably valued at 21 times forward earnings. Those qualities make it a great stock to buy and forget for long-term investors."", 'Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital drove Kraft Foods to merge with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz in 2015. The newly formed packaged foods giant initially struggled with sluggish organic sales growth for years as healthier products and private label brands lured away its core consumers. It also focused too much on cutting costs instead of expanding its business.', ""Despite those challenges, Kraft Heinz still accounts for 3.1% of Berkshire's portfolio. Under Miguel Patricio, who took the helm as its new CEO in 2019, it gradually turned around its business by launching fresh marketing campaigns for its classic brands, divesting its weaker brands, acquiring growing brands, and raising its prices to offset its slower shipments."", 'In late 2020, it launched a cost-cutting plan to reduce its total expenses by $2 billion over the following five years to stabilize its EPS growth. That ambitious turnaround strategy paid off. In 2023, its organic sales rose 3% as its adjusted EPS grew 7%. In 2024, it expects its organic sales to grow 0% to 2% and for its adjusted EPS to increase 1% to 3% -- even as it faces tough currency headwinds. Those steady growth rates, along with its low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12 and its high forward dividend yield of 4.5%, make it a reliable income play for conservative investors.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

But he has been singing these two companies' praises for years."", 'He was touting them again in his annual shareholder letter released in late February, giving investors another peek into his approach to investing.', 'Despite the fact they\'re operating in completely different industries, Buffett groups Coca-Cola\'s and American Express\' stocks together. They\'re both old and established -- American Express has been around since 1850, while Coca-Cola has been operating since 1886. Buffett joked that ""Berkshire is not big on newcomers.""', ""These are Berkshire Hathaway's longest-held equity positions. They are also the second and third-largest positions in the portfolio behind Apple's gargantuan percentage, with American Express accounting for 8.9% of the total and Coca-Cola accounting for 6.6%."", 'Both of these companies have a core business that has been incredibly successful for more than a century. He acknowledges that they\'ve each tried to branch into new side hustles that haven\'t worked out, but their main businesses have flourished, and, as he says, they ""travel.""', 'As their products have worked themselves across the globe, their names have become synonymous with their core businesses, building strong, resilient brands. And both of them market products and services that are always in demand. In fact, he calls them ""timeless essentials of our world.""', ""Last year, Buffett used these two companies to illustrate the value of a strong, established business that pays a dividend. Buffett made more than $1 billion in dividends from them in 2022, and since he hasn't sold any and they both raised their dividends last year, he made even more in 2023. He expects that to continue in 2024, and he has no intention of selling a share of either stock."", ""Buffett said that Berkshire Hathaway's percentage of American Express' earnings in 2023 was more than the total cost of buying American Express stock."", ""American Express and Coca-Cola both closed out a challenging 2023 on a high note. American Express revenue increased 11% year over year, with a 27% increase in earnings per share (EPS). Coca-Cola's sales increased 6% year over year, with a 13% increase in EPS. Both companies' CEOs discussed their increased brand value as a factor in their performance."", ""Coca-Cola is a Dividend King and raised its dividend for the 62nd consecutive year this month. American Express has paid dividends since 1989. It hasn't been as consistent with its increases, but it's made up for that with large increases -- more than double Coca-Cola's over the past 10 years."", 'Buffett sums up the lesson he\'s learned from holding onto these stocks for decades: ""When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', ""There's so much to take from that statement, and Buffett's wisdom doesn't need any elaboration. Investors can use it to consider what wonderful businesses they've integrated with or researched that have staying power. The key element, as Buffett has reiterated many times, is to focus on the business and not the stock movement."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Results were good overall, with revenues beating analyst predictions by 2.9% to hit US$17b. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in at US$4.79, some 4.0% above whatthe analysts had expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.', ' View our latest analysis for Sempra ', ""Following the recent earnings report, the consensus from 14 analysts covering Sempra is for revenues of US$15.9b in 2024. This implies a small 4.9% decline in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be US$4.80, roughly flat on the last 12 months. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$16.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.80 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", 'It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$82.35. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Sempra, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$94.00 and the most bearish at US$74.00 per share. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.', 'One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 4.9% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 11% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 4.1% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Sempra is expected to lag the wider industry.', ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sempra going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.."", 'It is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for Sempra that you need to take into consideration.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The technology firm processes 15 billion healthcare transactions annually and touches one in every three patient records, according to a letter from the American Hospital Association.', ""“They're employed by a variety of groups, health systems, health plans and vendors. And as a result, the impacts of the cyberattack have been incredibly significant and far-reaching,”\xa0Emily Dowsett, associate director of public affairs at the Medical Group Management Association, told Healthcare Dive."", 'The MGMA sent a letter on Wednesday to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, urging the agency to use its authority to support physician practices and ensure patients can access care.', '“It is imperative that all Change Healthcare operations be safely reestablished as quickly as possible,” Anders Gilberg, senior vice president of government affairs at the MGMA, wrote in the letter.', 'Healthcare Dive contacted 10\xa0health systems impacted by the outage that reported problems ranging from disrupted revenue management services to delayed prescription-filling processes.', 'None of the systems said they had received a definitive timeline from UnitedHealth regarding a restoration of services.', '“Patient care is our top priority and we have multiple workarounds to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” a UnitedHealth spokesperson said in a statement.', 'Providers said workarounds are indeed available as UnitedHealth described, but implementing the downtime procedures has come with headaches.', 'A spokesperson for Louisville, Kentucky-based Baptist Health said the “biggest issue” for Baptist in the days following the attack have been service delays, as pharmacies work through the backlog of claims filed during the outage.', 'Some medical groups have been unable to receive and finalize payments from insurers and patients, which can be a considerable financial challenge for smaller organizations, MGMA’s Dowsett said.', 'Administrators at Minneapolis-based Allina Health said downtime procedures have left “a large gap” in the health system’s ability to bill for most hospital services.', '“Fortunately, there are manual workarounds to help our patients with their insurance coverage and authorizations,” an Allina Health spokesperson told Healthcare Dive on Wednesday. “However, it is much more difficult to implement workarounds to properly and efficiently get claims submitted to insurance companies.”', 'Other practices have struggled to check insurance eligibility — compromising their ability to see new patients — or submit prior authorization requests. Allina, Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Novant Health and the Cleveland Clinic are among the nation’s leading health systems that confirmed insurance processing delays related to the Change outage.', 'In some cases, pharmacists have been forced to “estimate” the potential copay for a prescription due to a lack of available insurance information, according to a spokesperson for the Cleveland Clinic. At other pharmacies, patients may be charged full price to receive their prescriptions, according to Dowsett.', 'The potentially high cost of medications is scaring some patients and prompting them to contact their providers, Dowsett said.', '“This is pulling people from other work, what they would otherwise be doing, from clinical care,” Dowsett said.', 'The attack comes as experts and regulators have been sounding the alarm about cyber threats against the healthcare sector.', 'Over the past five years, the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights tracked a 256% increase in large data breaches involving hacking and a 264% jump in ransomware, a type of malware that denies users access to their data until a ransom is paid.', 'AlphV\xa0has recently targeted the healthcare industry, according to a bulletin released Tuesday by the HHS, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.', 'Since the middle of December, healthcare has been the most common victim of the prolific ransomware group, the agencies said.\xa0An AlphV\xa0administrator called on affiliates to launch cyberattacks against hospitals after law enforcement infiltrated and shut down the group’s infrastructure.', 'Amid a rise in threats, healthcare organizations need to prepare for cyberattacks, Errol Weiss, chief security officer at the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or Health-ISAC, told Healthcare Dive. They should have contingency plans in place in case a cyberattack takes down a vendor’s needed services for days or even weeks.', 'The center released recommendations this week, advising companies that they don’t need to sever network connections from all UnitedHealth entities to protect themselves from potential infection. UnitedHealth has reported that its investigation has found “no indication” that Optum, UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth systems have been affected.', 'But even disconnecting from affected Change networks can be a challenge because of the complexity of network configuration changes, Weiss added. In addition, some organizations have also raised concerns about other applications as well, like emails from affected domains or document sharing through the Microsoft 365 Office suite.', ""“There's a little bit of a wake-up call that we’re getting as one of the outcomes from this incident,” Weiss said. “It is demonstrating how complex and interconnected the healthcare ecosystem is in the U.S. and maybe even globally.”"", 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

Through decades of investing success that's seen his net worth skyrocket to over $130 billion and his company, Berkshire Hathaway, become one of the world's most valuable companies, it's easy to see why."", ""Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's success has inspired investors to mimic some of their investments to try and replicate some of their success. While this may not be the best approach for all investors, there are some Buffett stocks that investors can feel comfortable holding onto for the long haul."", ""Cola-Cola (NYSE: KO) is Berkshire Hathaway's fourth-largest holding, with 400 million shares.

Throughout 2023, we continued to focus on our five key business priorities. I'll start with a recap of our accomplishments, beginning with the successful deployment of the ERP to our U.S. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services business in September. In Europe, we made upgrades and enhancements to the Secure Information Destruction technology and made meaningful progress planning for our Regulated Waste and Compliance Services system transformation, which kicked off in earnest with our international team members last month."", ""I'll now provide a brief recap of our quality of revenue achievements in 2023 across three key areas: expanding service penetration, improving customer implementation velocity and deepening customer partnerships by developing enhanced customer solutions. We expanded our service penetration by launching cross-selling capabilities for our Regulated Waste and Compliance Services and Secure Information Destruction sales team members in the U.S. We also expanded Secure Information Destruction partnerships with large health care group purchasing organizations, which we expect will accelerate our ability to cross-sell and better penetrate the markets we serve. With regards to improving customer implementation velocity, we improved the speed to revenue by cutting in half the amount of time it takes to close a deal and begin servicing and providing value to our complex hospital customers sooner."", 'Throughout 2023, we strengthened our customer partnerships by conducting customer-focused workshops throughout North America. These sessions generated excitement for our enhanced compliance services and award-winning container solutions. Our most recent customer loyalty scores reflect the high level of value our customers receive from our services. Additionally, in support of our U.S. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services ERP deployment in September, the commercial organization was focused on supporting our customers through the system transition. In the second quarter of last year, we achieved our goal of reducing our debt leverage below 3x and have continued to maintain our debt leverage target. We have come a long way since 2019, having improved our leverage over 1.5x and reducing our debt by over $1.5 billion.', 'Portfolio optimization has been a major contributor to streamlining the company and our debt reduction since 2019 as we have completed 19 divestitures and exited 10 countries. In 2023 alone, we divested eight businesses and exited six countries. This helps simplify our business and will allow us to better focus our efforts on driving operational and financial performance in our core services in key markets. Turning to operational efficiency, modernization and innovation. In 2023, we completed over 20 infrastructure upgrades, including installing five new autoclaves, six new conveyance systems, two new shredders and an upgraded wastewater treatment plant at one of our North America incinerator facilities. In the fourth quarter, we successfully expanded an Ohio facility to handle future medical waste growth.', ""Since 2019, we have introduced improvements to more than half of our waste processing and treatment facilities in North America, including installing more than 25 new autoclaves, six new boilers and refurbishing more than 20 additional autoclaves and boilers. We have also reduced the average age of our North America fleet to less than four years since 2020 as we've continued to focus on modernizing our powered and non-powered units. Our engineering and operations teams have been focused on the construction of our newest incinerator facility in McCarran, Nevada. In November, we successfully installed foundational equipment including the incinerators and boilers. We remain on track to complete the construction phase of the project in the first half of 2024."", ""After construction is complete, we anticipate moving into the testing phase, which includes regulatory review. Once testing is successfully completed, we expect to ramp up the processing of waste with a target to achieve full production in mid-2025. Leveraging our transformed foundation as a springboard, we are positioned for growth and excited to introduce our next generation of key business priorities. These are: one, commercial and service excellence; two, operational excellence; three, digital implementation; and four, strategic capital allocation. I will turn it over to Cory to share his thoughts on our commercial and service excellence key business priority, and then I'll talk further about our other key priorities."", 'Cory White: Thank you, Cindy. Our commercial and service excellence key business priority is focused on driving profitable revenue growth delivering a differentiated value proposition and creating a seamless customer experience. This includes enhancing sales, service and product excellence to win, retain and grow strong customer relationships. Through our sales excellence initiatives, we continue to focus on our market-to-quote capabilities, including quality of revenue, digital marketing, e-commerce and contract management. Utilizing the ERP, we expect to further enhance sales excellence by gaining greater insights into sales opportunities, driving pricing intelligence, expanding market presence and enhancing sales productivity.', 'Service excellence is focused on delivering a seamless service experience through all phases of our customer life cycle which includes: one, making it easier for customers to manage their accounts through improved digital touch points with our enhanced online customer portal, including real-time waste tracking, trending benchmarking and sustainability reporting, accessing compliance training, requesting new services, making service changes and visibility to invoices; two, enhancing our customer experience by leveraging ERP-enabled tools to solve issues on first contact; and three, utilizing modern routing and tracking technology in field operations to ensure on-time waste collection and container management. This initiative is expected to strengthen customer relationships and further enhance our value proposition.', ""Finally, product excellence focuses on developing and launching enhanced solutions that deepen our customer partnerships, support our customers' safety and sustainability goals and promote further adoption of existing products and product innovation. We continue to commercialize innovative solutions and products that drive additional revenue opportunities while fulfilling our purpose to protect the health and well-being of health care organizations, commercial businesses, and communities we serve. I'll now turn the call back to Cindy to provide an overview of the remaining three key business priorities."", 'Cindy Miller: Thank you, Cory. Turning to operational excellence. This second key business priority is focused on driving margin expansion and cash flow improvement by leveraging the following: a skilled and dedicated workforce focused on safety, service, savings and sustainability, modern technologies, new and updated equipment and infrastructure and a modernized fleet. In 2024, we expect workforce management in our retained businesses to drive approximately $40 million to $45 million in savings. This reflects an approximate 6% year-over-year structural reduction in our workforce. Of the $40 million to $45 million savings, approximately $8 million in savings is expected to come from the reduction in force we announced on our third quarter call.', 'This reduction took place in October and resulted in approximately $3 million of severance. Over $20 million in additional savings is expected to come from the targeted reduction in force that is occurring in the first quarter of 2024 with an estimated $5 million to $7 million in severance that we anticipate incurring in the first quarter. The balance of the cost savings is expected to come from continued careful hiring and attrition that began in 2023. On our new digital implementation priority, we are beginning to strategically explore our next generation of capabilities using the foundation of our modern ERP system. We anticipate that digital, data and AI capabilities will help us to further deliver commercial and service excellence and efficiencies across our network and shared services.', 'The fourth and final of our next-generation key business priorities is strategic capital allocation, which has the following foundational elements: a targeted debt leverage ratio between 2.5x and 3x, investments in the business to maintain and modernize our infrastructure to drive growth and efficiencies, portfolio optimization including accretive tuck-in acquisitions using a disciplined acquisition and integration playbook and consideration of the potential for share repurchases. Consistent with this strategic capital allocation priority, in January, we successfully completed the acquisition of a Southeastern U.S. regulated medical waste company. In 2024, this business is expected to generate approximately $4 million in revenue. We expect to integrate this acquisition into our new ERP technology platform in the second half of 2024.', ""We are proud of the transformation journey we have been on and we are excited about the next generation of priorities we have outlined. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls. I'll now turn the call over to Janet to review our financial results."", 'Janet Zelenka: Thank you, Cindy. I will start by summarizing our fourth quarter results. As noted on Slide 5, revenues in the fourth quarter were $652 million compared to $670.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of divestitures of $28.6 million and favorable foreign exchange rates of $5 million, organic revenues increased $5.2 million. Organic revenues in Regulated Waste and Compliance Services grew $13.2 million while Secure Information Destruction organic revenues declined $8 million. Secure Information Destruction was impacted by lower commodity index revenues due to lower recycling revenues and lower fuel and environmental surcharges of $18 million, partially offset by higher service revenues of $10 million.', 'As noted on Slide 6, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services revenues were $439.9 million compared to $449.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and divestitures, organic revenues for Regulated Waste and Compliance Services increased 3.1%. North America Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenues grew $10.1 million or 2.8%, mainly driven by our three pricing levers which include pricing in existing contracts, new customer pricing and surcharges and fees. International Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenues grew $3.1 million or 5.1% in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by pricing. Secure Information Destruction revenues were $212.1 million compared to $221.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange rates, Organic revenues for Secure Information Destruction declined 3.6%, mainly due to lower commodity index revenues reflecting more than a $100 reduction in sorted office paper pricing per ton year-over-year and lower fuel and environmental surcharges. In North America, Secure Information Destruction organic revenues decreased $5.9 million or 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Recycling paper revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 contributed approximately 5.9% of the decline or $11.5 million due to lower sorted office paper pricing and lower tonnage. Service revenues contributed approximately 2.9% of growth or $5.6 million due to pricing, partially offset by lower fuel and environmental surcharges.', 'Approximately 50% of the lower sorted office paper recycling revenue was offset by a recycling recovery surcharge, which is reflected in service revenue. As a reminder, on the third quarter call, we discussed that some national customers were reducing their store footprint, which led to a contraction in their related service steps. This contraction continued at a slower pace in the fourth quarter. In International, Secure Information Destruction organic revenues decreased $2.1 million or 8.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, mainly due to lower recycling revenues and fuel and environmental surcharges. Income from operations in the fourth quarter was $37.1 million compared to $59.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The $22 million decrease was mainly due to the following: a gain on a divestiture in 2022 of $15.6 million, lower Secure Information Destruction commodity index revenue margin flow-through of $10.2 million, higher bad debt expense of $8.1 million mainly due to a lower fourth quarter of 2022 bad debt expense level as a result of improved North America Secure Information Destruction collections and higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense of $7.1 million in 2023.', 'These items were partially offset by margin flow-through of $18.9 million, including cost savings from productivity initiatives. Net income was $14.9 million or $0.16 diluted earnings per share compared to $31.8 million or $0.35 diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The difference was mainly related to lower income from operations of $22 million. Cash flow from operations for the year ending December 31, 2023 was $243.3 million compared to $200.2 million for 2022. As shown on Slide 8, the year-over-year increase of $43.1 million was mainly driven by lower FCPA settlement payments of $72.8 million and lower annual incentive compensation payments of $22.3 million, which were partially offset by accounts receivables net of deferred revenues of $68.5 million.', 'Adjusted income from operations was $84.5 million or 13% as a percentage of revenues compared to $90.6 million or 13.5% as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted income from operations decreased 50 basis points, mainly driven by lower Secure Information Destruction commodity index revenue margin flow-through of 160 basis points, higher bad debt expense of 120 basis points and higher incentive and stock-based compensation of 110 basis points. These were partially offset by margin flow-through of 340 basis points, including cost savings from productivity initiatives and margin expansion through portfolio optimization. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.54 compared to $0.60 in the fourth quarter 2022. As illustrated on the bridge on Slide 9, the $0.06 year-over-year decrease was driven by $0.09 from lower Secure Information Destruction commodity index revenue flow-through, $0.07 from higher bad debt expense and $0.06 from higher incentive compensation.', 'These were partially offset by $0.16 of margin flow-through. Capital expenditures for 2023 were $131.3 million compared to $132.2 million for 2022. Free cash flow for 2023 was $112 million compared to $68 million in 2022. As noted on Slide 8, the year-over-year increase of $44 million was mainly driven by higher operating cash of $43.1 million. After considering 2023 adjusted litigation and severance payments, free cash flow excluding these two items was $138.5 million, which is approximately $30 million below our 2023 free cash flow guidance range of $170 million to $190 million. This difference is mainly driven by the timing of U.S. Regulated Waste Customer billings due to the ERP implementation as we are holding and reworking some invoices for our largest customers to ensure accuracy.', 'Turning to the full-year 2023 results on Slide 14. Revenues were $2.66 billion compared to $2.7 billion in 2022. Excluding the impact of divestitures of $101.6 million and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $0.1 million, organic revenues increased $56.3 million or 2.2%. When 2023 and 2022 results are normalized to exclude the revenues from divested businesses, revenues were approximately $2.63 billion in 2023 compared to $2.57 billion in 2022. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenue growth was $71.9 million, while Secure Information Destruction organic revenues declined $15.6 million. Secure Information Destruction was impacted by lower commodity index revenues of almost $50 million due to lower recycling revenues and lower fuel and environmental surcharges.', ""When considering Secure Information Destruction's organic revenue growth over a two-year compounded annual growth rate, it grew 6.6% since 2021. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $77.3 million compared to $153.7 million in 2022. The $76.4 million decline was mainly due to change in divestiture net losses of $79 million, higher incentive compensation and timing of stock-based compensation of $22.7 million, lower Secure Information Destruction and commodity index revenues and the corresponding margin flow-through impact of $18.5 million and fleet costs of $10.5 million. These were partially offset by margin flow-through of $41.2 million, mainly from cost savings from productivity initiatives and lower bad debt expense of $7.1 million."", 'Net loss for 2023 was $21.4 million or $0.23 diluted loss per share compared with net income of $56 million or $0.61 diluted earnings per share in 2022. The difference was mainly related to lower income from operations of $76.4 million, as previously discussed. Adjusted EBITDA was $420 million in 2023 compared to $432.2 million in 2022. The $12.2 million decline was mainly due to inflationary and supply chain costs of $25.5 million, higher incentive compensation and timing of stock-based compensation of $22.7 million and lower Secure Information Destruction commodity index revenues and the corresponding margin flow-through impact of $18.5 million. These were partially offset by margin flow-through of $51.1 million and lower bad debt expense of $7.1 million.', 'In 2023, divested businesses generated a nominal amount of adjusted EBITDA. When 2023 results are normalized to exclude results from divested businesses, 2023 adjusted EBITDA would still have been approximately $420 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.89 in 2023 compared to $2.04 in 2022. As illustrated on the bridge on Slide 17, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates and divestitures of $0.04, the remaining $0.11 year-over-year decrease was driven by $0.19 from higher incentive and stock-based compensation, $0.15 from lower Secure Information Destruction commodity index revenues, $0.09 from higher fleet costs and $0.08 mainly from higher taxes. These were partially offset by $0.34 from margin flow-through and $0.06 from lower bad debt expense.', 'I will now turn to our 2024 guidance, which includes forward-looking statements as contemplated in our safe harbor statement as referenced at the opening of this call. Our guidance is shown on Slide 18 and is as follows: One, we expect to grow organic revenues 3% to 5% on a normalized revenue base of $2.63 billion. Two, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.50. This assumes approximately a 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA on a 2023 normalized adjusted EBITDA base of $420 million. As shown on Slide 19, this margin growth rate anticipates revenue margin flow-through of approximately 4%, cost of revenue efficiencies and cost reductions of approximately 9%, mainly driven by our workforce management actions and operational initiatives, and selling, general and administrative efficiencies and cost reductions of approximately 4% mainly driven by our workforce management actions.', 'These are expected to be partially offset by commodity impacts of 3%, mainly associated with sorted office paper pricing, which assumes a range of $125 to $140 a ton and fuel estimates for 2024 from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Compared to last year, we anticipate that the first half of 2024 will have a more challenging paper pricing year-over-year variance as the sorted office paper price per ton was above $200 on average for the first quarter of 2023 and above $185 on average for the second quarter of 2023 and the second half of 2023 pricing return to the historical average range. Three, as noted on Slide 20, we expect to generate free cash flow of $210 million to $265 million excluding additional interest payments due to redeeming the $600 million bond with proceeds from the revolver and severance payments.', 'Excluding these two cash outlays, we anticipate an adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate of 44% to 55% in 2024. Severance payments in 2024 are expected to be approximately $5 million to $7 million. The additional in-year interest cash payments from redeeming the bond and higher interest rates are expected to be $14 million to $19 million. When we redeem the bond, interest payments will shift from being semiannual bond payments to monthly revolver interest cash payments. And four, we expect capital expenditures of $140 million to $160 million. Regarding the timing of free cash flow generation through 2024, we anticipate the first quarter to be a use of cash as it includes our annual incentive compensation payouts, the semiannual debt interest payments and the timing of accounts receivable collections.', 'Because of the heavier utilization of cash in the first quarter, we anticipate that our first quarter debt leverage ratio will be above 3x and then is anticipated to return to our debt leverage ratio range of 2.5x to 3x in 2024. I will now turn the call back to Cindy.', ""Cindy Miller: Thank you, Janet. Our focus on ESG and sustainability is an ongoing pursuit, which we actively incorporate into our everyday practices and into our strategic business plans. In early February, we received our grade from CDP, and I'm excited to share that we achieved a B score, our highest rating since we began filing with the CDP three years ago.

as folks look to save on their spring and summer vacations, as Carrie mentioned, credit card points can be a smart way to keep your costs down when traveling.', ""So joining us now with the best tips and tricks for putting those points to work as part of our 2024 travel guide, we've got Eric Rosen, The Points Guy's director of content."", ""Eric, I'm going to jump right in with a personal question from a viewer named my mother."", ""You're booking a flight."", ""You don't have enough points to cover the flight."", 'I told her to wait until she had enough points to buy it.', ""Tell me if I'm right or wrong."", ""ERIC ROSEN: Well, you're right and wrong, I would say."", 'There are certain airline programs that let you use points towards part of your flight, of course.', 'But for now, you obviously have to rack up enough points to actually use those to redeem them for the flights.', 'That said, you can also go for a variety of different credit cards, like a Chase Sapphire Preferred or an Amex Gold card, as part of your wallet so that you can actually use those points towards the cost of your airfare, without having to be loyal to one airline program or another.', 'So there are lots of ways to play the game to save some money.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, and also, you just heard our Kerry Hannon talking about the importance of being flexible and booking early, which I suspect is also helpful when you're using points."", 'ERIC ROSEN: Absolutely.', 'Those are great pieces of advice.', 'Airlines open up their award availability about 331 days in advance.', 'It seems to be typical among US airlines.', ""Some don't schedule quite that far out."", ""So if you know your plans well in advance, that's when you'll find that award availability."", ""But also, to her point, if you're flexible, you can find some last-minute deals."", ""As airlines find they have unsold seats, they'll open those up for award availability."", 'You can put those miles to use.', 'You might just end up flying, you know, on a Wednesday night instead of a Friday night, things like that.', ""So, the more you can be flexible, the more likely you're going to be able to put your points in miles to use."", 'MADISON MILLS: And I know part of the advice is to utilize price alerts and to, you know, again, be flexible.', 'To your point, Eric, is there a moment though where you advise people to go ahead and pull the trigger and not continue to hold and wait?', ""ERIC ROSEN: If you've been tracking prices and they're within your budget, I would say just book the flight then."", ""As you get closer and closer to the departure time, chances are those prices aren't going to drop."", ""You won't see a precipitous $500 to $200 drop on the airfare that you're going for."", ""So if it fits within your budget, you've got a limited amount of vacation days, the kids are off of school, don't wait too long to book your trip."", ""That said, if things really aren't in your budget, you might want to save it for a later vacation sort of like she had mentioned, where instead of going on your spring break now, think about an early summer trip before everyone's out of school, or towards the end of summer right before school starts again, where you might have a better chance of locking in a good price that fits your budget."", 'JULIE HYMAN: So, Eric, Maddie asked a question on behalf of her mom.', ""I'm going to ask you a question on behalf of myself."", 'I am not a points girl.', ""And I'm just wondering what-- and I have what is probably a mistaken perception in my mind that it's complicated, right?"", ""That navigating, accruing the points, you know, and then using them, that it's somehow difficult to do."", ""Disabuse me of that notion, if it's incorrect."", 'And tell me like, who are these-- who is best served by getting these points situations and cards and using them?', 'ERIC ROSEN: Absolutely.', ""You know, airline programs, hotel programs do a really good job at making it seem very complicated to use their miles or saying that like, you just need to rack up some miles and you'll get a free flight."", ""And then you go to look and you're not able to find the thing that you actually need."", 'If you want to keep things simple, there are a lot of ways you can do it, right?', ""Get a solid cashback card like the Chase Freedom, right, so you can earn points on every purchase and then use those points for cashback, whether it's on travel expenses or on something else."", ""We also suggest going for transferable points, something like Chase Ultimate Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, Capital One miles, where you can redeem them at a set rate for things like flights and hotels so you don't really have to do a ton of mental calculations in order to get some value."", ""Or you can transfer them to a variety of different airline and hotel partners that suit your need at a particular time, rather than having to stick to one program that might change its rules on a dime and leave you without enough miles for that trip you've been having your eye on for the last couple of months."", 'MADISON MILLS: All right.', ""Eric, one final question here for the users out there who have been utilizing credit card points, I'm wondering about the kind of transfer deals that come up from time to time."", 'What is the best way for folks to stay on top of those potential opportunities, and capitalize on them at the right times?', 'ERIC ROSEN: Definitely.', ""So when you're talking about are transfer bonuses, where instead of like one Amex point to one British Airways miles or one delta mile, for instance, you might get a 25% bonus."", ""So if you transfer 1,000 of them, you'll get 1,250 miles instead of the usual 1,000."", 'The best way to stay on top of those is to follow sites like ours, The Points Guy, because we have regular updates of what transfer bonuses are currently out there.', ""And I would say don't go speculatively transferring all of your points from those programs all at once because you should have a specific imminent redemption in mind where you can really take advantage of that extra value, rather than counting on something coming down the pike in a few months time."", ""Because like I said, programs can change, or that hotel that's in one category of award redemption today could go up the next day and then you've transferred all these points and you're not quite able to use them because you can't transfer them back to your other original account."", 'MADISON MILLS: All right, Eric.', 'We really appreciate it.', 'Thank you so much for that advice and have a great weekend.', 'Thank you.', 'ERIC ROSEN: Thank you.']"

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DAY.', ""On February 28, 2024, O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) filed its annual 10-K report, revealing a continued trajectory of growth and strategic expansion. With a market capitalization of over $48 billion as of mid-2023 and the completion of the Groupe Del Vasto acquisition, O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) solidifies its position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts retailer. The company's financial health is underscored by the opening of 186 new stores in 2023, a testament to its aggressive growth strategy and commitment to enhancing its distribution network. As we dissect the 10-K filing, we will explore the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY)'s market presence and future outlook."", ""Dual Market Strategy and Customer Service: O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) has honed a dual market strategy that caters to both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional service providers, a unique competitive advantage that has fueled its growth. In 2023, DIY sales accounted for approximately 53% of total sales, while professional service provider sales made up about 47%. This balance allows O'Reilly to capture a broad customer base and mitigate market fluctuations that may disproportionately affect one segment. The company's commitment to superior customer service, including technically proficient store personnel and a strategic distribution network, ensures high customer satisfaction and repeat business."", ""Strategic Distribution Network: O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) operates a sophisticated hub-and-spoke distribution model, which includes 30 regional distribution centers and 385 hub stores. This network provides same-day or overnight access to an average of 152,000 stock keeping units (SKUs), positioning O'Reilly as a leader in parts availability. The company's ability to deliver hard-to-find parts quickly is a significant strength that enhances customer loyalty and drives sales."", ""Dependence on Professional Service Providers: While O'Reilly's dual market strategy is a strength, it also presents a weakness due to the highly fragmented nature of the professional service provider market. The company's reliance on this segment, which is more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures, could pose risks to revenue stability. O'Reilly must navigate this fragmentation and maintain strong relationships with professional service providers to sustain its market share."", ""Limited International Presence: Despite its strong domestic performance, O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) has a relatively limited international footprint, with only 62 stores in Mexico and the recent acquisition of Groupe Del Vasto in Canada. This limited global diversification could hinder the company's ability to tap into emerging markets and reduce its exposure to the competitive U.S. market."", ""Expansion Through Acquisitions: The acquisition of Groupe Del Vasto represents a strategic opportunity for O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) to expand its presence in North America. The company's growth strategy includes the opening of 190 to 200 new stores in 2024, which will enhance market penetration and provide a platform for further expansion. O'Reilly's ability to identify and integrate strategic acquisitions will be crucial in maintaining its growth trajectory."", ""Omnichannel Growth: O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving customer preferences for digital and in-person shopping experiences. The company's omnichannel strategy, which includes enhancing its digital platforms like www.OReillyAuto.com and www.FirstCallOnline.com, offers a seamless customer experience and could drive future sales growth."", ""Competitive Landscape: O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) operates in a highly competitive industry, contending with other large specialty retailers, as well as smaller independent operators. The company must continuously innovate and provide exceptional customer service to maintain its competitive edge and market share."", ""Regulatory Risks: O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) is subject to various federal, state, and local regulations, particularly those related to the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances. Compliance with these regulations has not materially impacted operations to date, but any future changes could impose additional costs or operational constraints."", ""In conclusion, O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) exhibits a robust financial and strategic position, as evidenced by its latest 10-K filing. The company's strengths in its dual market strategy and distribution network provide a solid foundation for continued growth. However, it must address weaknesses such as its dependence on the professional service provider market and limited international presence. Opportunities for expansion through acquisitions and omnichannel initiatives present exciting prospects, while the competitive landscape and regulatory environment pose ongoing threats. Overall, O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) is well-equipped to navigate the dynamic automotive aftermarket industry and drive future success."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$14b and statutory earnings per share of US$10.23 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Universal Health Services is executing in line with expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Universal Health Services after the latest results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Universal Health Services ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Universal Health Services from 14 analysts is for revenues of US$15.4b in 2024.

In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$15.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$11.94 in 2024.

There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Universal Health Services analyst has a price target of US$208 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$140. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. It's clear from the latest estimates that Universal Health Services' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 7.7% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 5.8% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 6.8% annually. Universal Health Services is expected to grow at about the same rate as its industry, so it's not clear that we can draw any conclusions from its growth relative to competitors."", 'The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Universal Health Services following these results. There was also an upgrade to revenue estimates, although as we saw earlier, forecast growth is only expected to be about the same as the wider industry.

Also welcome to Paul Wiseman, who recently joined Celsius as our Senior Vice President of Communications. Celsius had a stellar 2023 fourth quarter, the best earnings year in our company's history. We have achieved nearly complete distribution coverage in the United States, topping 98% ACV, which is a major achievement, putting our products in reach of more consumers and more consumption occasions with greater flavors and size options than ever before. In 2023, Celsius set a new yearly revenue record, growing more than 102% or $664 million in sales to finish the year at just over $1.3 billion. Celsius is now truly a $1 billion brand.Our impressive share gains in 2023 have resulted in Celsius becoming the first company to break the 10-share barrier in more than a decade. According to Circana, IRI's recent 4-week read ending February 11, 2024 in total energy U.S., Celsius held a new record of 11.5 share nationwide in MULOC. The energy drink category is now a 3-team race.As of January 2024, Celsius had exceeded a 15 share in over a dozen U.S. markets and a few of those, we are within just a few points of our next closest competitor or have already taken them. Our strong innovation pipeline continues to delight consumers whose taste for zero sugar energy drinks has nearly tripled the overall category sales to a zero sugar majority. Although this year, we have launched 2 new core SKUs, Sparkling Raspberry Peach and Fizz-Free Blue Raspberry Lemonade. In addition, 2 new Celsius Vibe flavors, Astro Vibe and Galaxy Vibe, which has taken our Space Odyssey, truly even further with the launch of our Cosmic Vibe in 2023 in Circle K. Celsius also launched Celsius Essential's product line, which has proven essential performance energy with essential aminos. We are executing our plans to grow the business internationally, taking a methodical approach in each new market we enter. We're very pleased with our sales in Canada after 2 months in the country. Consumer enthusiasm and acceptance has exceeded our expectations. We're pursuing disciplined growth in our best-in-class sales and marketing organizations. And just 2 weeks ago, Celsius was recognized with the 7-Eleven's prestigious 2023 Supplier of the Year award in a nonalcoholic category. This is a tremendous achievement. And I want to thank all our dedicated team members on achieving this great top industry award. Best-in-class teams drive best-in-class results. With nearly full distribution, we are focusing on driving growth through 3 areas: increasing total distribution points at each location, growing in nontracked channels and international expansion over the long-term horizon. Celsius was again the top driver of the energy category in dollars and units sold in MULOC, ending in the fourth quarter, up 126.6% and up 140.2% for the full year of 2023, supporting a 30.6% of all the energy category growth for the year.Already this year, we've launched several new and exciting innovations as well as a brand update to our line of Fizz-Free beverages, which have a strong and loyal consumer base. A new Fizz-Free multipack available now in Target stores brings together refreshing selection to our consumers who prefer the noncarbonated energy drinks.Sales of Celsius Essentials, our new line of performance-oriented and energy, a 16-ounce beverage products launched in the fourth quarter at 7-Eleven stores across the United States and our 2 new flavors, Sparkling Mango Tango and Sparkling Fruit Burst bring the Celsius Essential line to 6 unique SKUs. As of January 2024, Celsius Essentials has achieved a record 40% ACV year-to-date, February 18th, it's at 49% ACV, continuing to see greater acceptance across retailers across the country. Also in January, our Celsius on-the-go powder claimed the position in the energy powder category according to Circana's IRI commanding a 23.1 share, having increased 5.6% compared to the prior period. We have several new on-the-go powder innovations plan for this year and see great opportunities with our [virtual] on-the-go product line.In 2024, spring resets began in January and typically run through May. We are very pleased with the incremental space we're gaining, which will be reflected across the first and second quarters of 2024. As a reminder, planograms used for most of 2023 when our dollar sales grew 140% were created while we were holding and held approximately 4.5 share in the category. For 2024, shelf space planning was conducted with retail partners in Q3 of 2023, when we held a digital -- double-digit share position. Celsius is also now fully integrated into PepsiCo's annual planning cycle, and we anticipate ongoing close collaboration with our primary North American distribution partner and expanded key accounts team.Our pursuit of a perfect store resulted in a 60% increase in display activity across the United States, and we placed more than over 10,000 Celsius branded coolers in 2023 and an increase of over 300% year-over-year. We intend to continue growing our base of branded coolers throughout this year. Nontracked channels continue to be a tailwind for us as well. Club sales for the fourth quarter were $77.1 million, up 64% year-over-year. Club sales for the full year 2023 were $254.6 million, representing an $83.6 million increase year-over-year.We achieved the #1 energy drink position on Amazon in 2023, finishing the full year revenue at $101 million, a 72.9% increase year-over-year. Our refreshing great tasting products are ideal for the meal occasion, and today, more than 12.5% of our PepsiCo sales is to the foodservice channel. For example, in 2023, we gained distribution in over 2,000 Jersey Mike stores and are authorized to sell in more than 3,000 Dunkin' Donut locations nationwide. We believe there is incremental growth opportunities for Celsius and nontracked outlets, such as vending, hospitals, corporate cafeterias and college campuses and more.Turning to international. We began distribution in sales in Canada through Pepsi in mid-January. As we had previously signaled, after approximately 1 month of sales, we are very pleased with the results and even more so to delight our Canadian consumers who have embraced our products.International sales reached $14.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $54.7 million for the full year. Also in January, we announced a sales and distribution agreement with Suntory Beverage for Great Britain and Ireland. We expect sales in the United Kingdom to begin gradually starting in the Finnish channel in the second quarter. We expect additional international expansion this year. And as previously stated, we're taking a methodical approach to our international growth, and we will be following our international growth playbook in each new market we enter.Before I hand it over to Jarrod to discuss financial highlights for the quarter and the full year, we have several exciting marketing developments and achievements to be proud of. Celsius recently announced a renewed multiyear global team sponsorship with Formula One's iconic Ferrari racing team. Major League soccer kicked off its regular season last week, and Celsius is a proud league partner as well as key sponsor of multiple teams and players across the United States and Canada. These strategic investments placed our premium brand in the forefront of consumers who share our passion to live fit.With that, I'll pass it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jarrod Langhans, to discuss our fourth quarter and 2023 full year financial results. Jarrod?"", 'Jarrod Langhans', ""Thanks, John. It was another great quarter in which we continue to exceed both internal and external expectations. Not only are we continuing to benefit from Pepsi's distribution system, but we're also delivering on increased SKU count, improved placement, increased displays and continuous improvement within velocities. As we look to Q1 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our growth. Turning to our fourth quarter financial highlights. Revenue for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $347 million, an increase of 95% from $178 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2022. Driven by our North American business, where fourth quarter revenues were $333 million, an increase of 97% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 68% to $15 million as velocity continued to increase. As it relates to days on hand with our primary distributor, our inventory turns relative to depletions was consistent with our Q3 2023 turnover.We attribute our sales volume growth for the quarter compared to 2022 to several key drivers, including successful integration into the Pepsi distribution system, which has resulted in broader availability, increased SKU mix, and improved placement. We're also benefiting from robust expansion in our traditional distribution channels and club channels with SKU increases in placement improvements contributing significantly. Moreover, our products are now found in several new channels within CNG and foodservice.Gross profit for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, increased 110% to $166 million, up from $79 million in the year ago quarter. Gross profit margins in the fourth quarter were approximately 48% of revenues compared to approximately 44% for the prior year fourth quarter. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to efficiencies in raw material sourcing product-based reduction and benefits from improved leverage across promotional allowances. Q4 was the fifth consecutive quarter that we were operating within the Pepsi distribution system, and we expect to continue driving efficiencies while maintaining our #1 goal of keeping the shelf stock to meet strong consumer demand.Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were approximately $80 million, a decrease of approximately 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was due to prior year costs associated with the termination of legacy distributors as part of the transition to the Pepsi network. We continue to invest behind our growth in Q4, incurring sales and marketing costs in line with historical rates. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 23% compared to 29% in the prior year adjusted for distributor termination expenses in 2022. We plan to continue investment in our sales and marketing and plan a similar spend as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2024.General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, were approximately $27 million, an increase of 24% relative to Q4 2022. As a percentage of sales, G&A was 8% compared to 12% in the prior year as we continue to leverage our G&A against our significant growth. And looking back at prior periods, even with our historical growth rates, we do tend to see some seasonality within the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. We saw similar activities in the fourth quarter, whereby we are not able to capitalize on the great work from our sales and marketing teams as it relates to displays on hand and other promotional activities that we are able to take advantage of during the summer selling season. Even with this, we ended the year strong and have since well exceeded the 10 share marker as noted by John earlier in the call.Looking at the full year 2023. As you will see in the 10-K issued this morning, we made great progress in our remediation efforts around our internal control environment. We were successful in remediating the prior period controls associated with IT general controls as well as creating and delivering a much more robust [coastal] environment. Although we made huge strides in 2023, there are still a handful of areas where components of larger areas of the control environment needs some additional time to fully remediate.With that said, I'd like to thank the entire Celsius team for the great effort and in particular, our finance and IT teams for their focus and dedication to this matter in 2023. I look forward to our continued progress in 2024. Now to the results. Revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $1.3 billion an increase of 102% from $654 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, driven by our North American business. North America full year 2023 revenues were $1.27 billion, an increase of 105% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 52% to $55 million in 2023 relative to full year 2022. Gross profit for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, increased 134% to $633 million, up from $271 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margins in the full year of 2023 were approximately 48% of revenues compared to approximately 41% for the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to lower package and raw material costs. As things stand today, we would expect 2024 gross profit margins to be fairly consistent with the Q4 and full year margin profile, as we are confident in maintaining the great progress that was made in 2023. We are always shooting for the moon but with the uncertainty around the macro environment from both an operational and promotional perspective, we believe that it is prudent to give ourselves some additional time into 2024.As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 20% in the 12 months of 2023 compared to 24% in the prior year same period, adjusted for distributor termination expenses. This demonstrated the leverage that we can obtain within our sales and marketing costs. We made great progress in 2023, but we are now moving to the next level and the next target beyond 10% market share. And to do that, we will need to continue to invest in our growth and our brand, as seen with the multiple Super Bowl activations that we did in February, our recently announced multiyear partnership with Ferrari within Formula One as well as our multiyear MLS partnership.G&A expense as a percentage of sales was 8% for the 12 months of 2023 versus 12% in the prior year same period. We will continue to invest in our back shop and build out a team that is value-added to our operations, sales and marketing programs. There will be opportunity to further leverage G&A in 2024 and beyond, but it will be at a thoughtful and methodical pace. Focusing now on liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash in excess of $755 million and net working capital in excess of $928 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled in excess of $140 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, which compares to $108 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. We will continue to invest in our business (technical difficulty)."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.', 'Mark Stiefel Astrachan', ""Two questions for me. One, just on gross margin, maybe talk a little bit about why it stepped back in 4Q relative to 3Q, even after adjusting for the promotional allowance accrual last quarter, meaning I would have expected to see a little bit better. Was there some sort of one-offs in that number? And how do we think about progression of that into '24? And then the second question, I appreciate the commentary on inventories from a channel standpoint with your largest customer. But if I take a look at what the sales look like in the [scanner] data track channels in addition to what you disclosed in the regulatory filings on Amazon and Costco sales, I still get a fairly big disconnect between what it looks like you should have sold in the quarter and what you actually did, meaning that you undershipped somewhere in the channel. So maybe you could help with that, too."", 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. Thank you, Mark. I'll join in on the first part of the question, and I'll throw it over to Jarrod as well. I think when you look at the overall margins, I think we're really pleased with the margins, especially for the full year, up over 660 basis points. Just a phenomenal job on behalf of the team on supply chain and our key accounts team. We're maintaining a pricing promotional architecture within the category.When you look at the, really the fourth quarter, we did launch a new line, our Celsius Essentials line, which are the 16-ounce line, and we had a variety of innovational launches that were executed during the quarter. So I think we're pretty pleased with where the margins came in, and there's opportunities to improve going forward. But at this point in time, I think that's a -- team did a really good job for the year. And in regards to inventory by channel, we did have some seasonal impact in Q4 that we did experience. We did have good results on Amazon and within the club channel, but we did see especially impacted mainly in food and really large format. A lot of our volume, we've done a great job on half of our distribution partner as well, really keeping the amount of cases on display up. We're still gaining -- we hope to gain additional placements and additional expansion in the upcoming sets that are being reset. But we do rely heavily, especially in large format on display activity. And when you look at the fourth quarter, we do see a lot of display activity coming from seasonal items that we're competing with outside of the summer or the rest of the year. So those are some headwinds we experienced in the fourth quarter, but I'll throw it over to Jarrod for any additional highlights."", 'Jarrod Langhans', ""No, you're right, John. It's -- when we're looking at kind of just more of a days-on-hand perspective with our largest distributor, we did have the innovations that we filled the pipe with that would offset, I would say maybe some reductions you're talking about, Mark. But on a net-net basis, the days on hand in total for us was in good shape. And to John's point, the Q4 tends to be a little bit pressured just because of the inventory on hand across our retail customers and our mass and grocery customers."", 'Mark Stiefel Astrachan', ""Got it. Maybe just one follow-up then. If we think about the innovation in your comments you just made about the net-net kind of equaling out. It sounds like you're saying that the innovation offset the legacy products. Is that the case as you think about the shelf resets and incremental distribution, meaning it can't be a 1:1, so you're going to add more space. So why wouldn't the Pepsi system take more of the products, meaning taking innovation plus the legacy because you've got to backfill the legacy sales?"", 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. I think when we looked at our #1 customer, we look at their inventory levels, they're fairly consistent with Q3 to Q4. So even though we did take some innovation on. So it's -- I think if we look at the scan data, we had really strong scan data in the fourth quarter, and it's -- we'll see how this continues to evolve."", 'Jarrod Langhans', ""Yes, it's a good question, Mark. I think, we can just tell you where we were as of 12/31 and on a net-net basis, in total, our days on hand were consistent and in good shape. And as we got to January, we started rolling out all of the innovation that you can see all across the U.S., and it's been very successful and being very good and it has been incremental thus far."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.', 'Peter K. Grom', ""So I was hoping to get some perspective on how you're thinking about the market share trajectory from here. Obviously, things sort of leveled out towards the latter portion of '23, but we've actually seen some nice improvement to start the year. Maybe just to start, is the improvement we've seen year-to-date, largely a function of kind of that innovation you touched on rather than shelf resets. And then I guess with more resets to come, how would you think investors should think about the share trajectory as we look out to March and into the spring. Jarrod, you mentioned that you've now surpassed 10%. You're now focusing on a new target. So just any color on what that new target might be from a share perspective."", 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. No. Thank you, Peter. I mean we're not going to give any forward guidance on the future share, but we do look at the current trajectories and where we are currently at within different category -- within a variety of segments and the categories. And you mentioned Amazon. We disclosed Amazon. We're close to a 20 share within the energy category on Amazon. And then -- if you also look at -- I mentioned in my script, we have 12 key markets that we're tracking ahead of 15 share within the category and that's MULOC data. So there is a good trajectory there.I think the biggest opportunity for us when you look at it is really in convenience. And we've built this brand going through the variety of channels. And the last -- the biggest opportunity is in convenience, where you about 56% 57% of all sales are sold. So that's where we anticipate the biggest resets to take place. In the coming resets, right now, in the convenience channel, we are just at a 10 share. So we're really excited about the opportunities you have there versus if you just look at the food category, we're roughly around a 16 share within the energy category. So those are some recent data points that we have that, that we've shared within the script as well as in the earnings release. And we've talked before, we're somewhere between the average, as Jarrod mentioned, we're about we closed at about a 10 share, and we're on close to a 20 share within Amazon. So we're working hard. The team is working hard and we're executing, and that doesn't include the new 16-ounce Essentials line, which is just getting started this year, which we're excited about."", 'Peter K. Grom', ""No, that's really helpful. And then I guess just on follow-up just on international. Can you maybe help us understand how we should think about the contribution from a revenue perspective. Are you exploring any additional markets for this year? Or would anything else kind of be more of a '25 narrative? And then just within that, I'm sure a lot of people and you've gotten this question a lot, but just, maybe explain why Suntory was the distributor of choice for the U.K. and Ireland?"", 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. Thank you, Peter. I think number one, when we look at international expansion, we just went into Canada. We talked about that into -- on the script. We're really excited on the consumer acceptance. We're also excited about the -- we're in 7-Eleven in Couche-Tard. It's product is doing really well, and we're expanding. So our partner is excited. Canada should be a big market. U.K., did announce Suntory for our partner there. They -- we're looking for the best partners to align with on our go-to-market strategy. One thing that was very attractive about Suntory is their access to the gym community. And we're really focused on a methodical approach as we expand and grow, really about building awareness, trial, that foundational base of loyalty and then scaling. So as we look to see the size and the timing and sequencing of international, I think that's -- we'll know that as we go through these markets and expand in these markets. And how quickly we are accepted, we can move as fast as we can. But we want to be very cognizant on entering new markets through a methodical approach about building that loyal foundation before we go and overall scale. So those are the comments there in regards, and we're really excited about our partnership with Suntory."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.', 'Michael Scott Lavery', ""You touched on unmeasured channels as one of your big opportunities and gave some examples, corporate cafeterias, universities vending. There's lots of physical distribution points under all that. And I just would love to get a sense of how we should think about how quickly -- how close to hand those are? How quickly those could ramp up, kind of what the trajectory might look like for momentum in those areas?"", 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. I think everyone is really excited about that. When you look at our PepsiCo revenues, over 12% is coming from really the foodservice. Internally here, we think there's a big opportunity there. We see that Celsius is much broader opportunity when you look at the TAM versus, say, traditional energy, we're seeing consumers -- consumer consumption increase outside of that energy need state. We're seeing the product being paired with sandwiches and smoothies and bowls and a variety of opportunities for fast casual. So I think it's a little bit too early for us to really know how big that opportunity is. We have a -- we'll probably know over the next 12 to 24 months as we further expand in some additional quick service as well as expand in additional foodservice accounts and then universities and hospitals as well is a huge opportunity for us. Not able to quantify that at this time, but we do see it as big opportunity."", 'Michael Scott Lavery', ""Okay. And just on the Canada, U.K., Ireland launches, as we think about margins for 2024, obviously, you'd spend ahead of really ramping those revenues. And so all else equal, should we expect a dip in EBITDA margins for -- or EBIT margins for 2024 versus 2023? Or can you just give us a sense of how to think about the spending or what's in your plans for how that looks?"", 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. I'll turn that over to Jarrod for additional comments."", 'Jarrod Langhans', ""Yes. So they're going to be a little different. Canada where most of the population is, I think, within 80 miles of the U.S. border and also being so close. We actually already had a co-packer in Canada that we were using as a backup for our U.S. business. So that rollout and that growth, we think, will be at a different trajectory than the U.K., which we're kind of launching from 0. So there will be investment in both markets as we build brand awareness and as we really build out the system. We won't have the same scale and leverage advantages within the manufacturing as we do in the U.S. So there is going to be some costs and some investment there. But it will be, let's call it -- it's not going to be a significant component of either our growth or our cost infrastructure this year. So we do believe that the numbers that we discussed on our prepared remarks, we'll be able to handle those investments as well."", 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. And I'll just -- in regards to -- when you look at it, Michael, one thing we've noticed is the brand awareness, even though we're not in the U.K., there is an underlying brand awareness just associated with -- the world is really so small these days, a one click away. So a lot of our influencers and social media activations are actually being picked up with our potential consumers in the U.K. So we had a little bit -- we have more brand awareness than we actually had initially anticipated based on our research. So we're excited, we think it's going to be a great market for us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities.', 'Gerald John Pascarelli', ""Great. Just one on gross margin. Another quarter in the high 40s here. But in the energy category, you've already had a larger competitor take a rate increase. There's sentiment that your larger competitor will ultimately follow suit. So in the event this happens, how do you think about managing your price gaps relative to peers? I guess, just curious on your thoughts around a potential rate increase this year as that would obviously imply upside to your high 40s margin target? Any color there would be great."", 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. Thank you, Gerald. There's opportunities. We want to be a premium-priced product. I think if you look at it per ounce basis, we feel we're very competitively priced. There's a variety of different levers than just taking frontline pricing. So we have our pricing promotional strategies that we utilize as well. We just -- we're launching a new line extension as well with our Celsius Essential 16-ounce. And then you also -- you have your pricing architecture by channel as well so in pack size. So there's ways to navigate that. I think we're very pleased with the way we finished the year with margins and we're really focused on driving share and revenue growth and continue to drive consumer consumption and ultimately, that daily consumption we're looking for. And we're just really getting started here. When you look at just now a 10 share in the energy category in convenience. So there's a long runway ahead. But it's something we watch closely. At this point, we're not going to make any comments on future any price increases at this time."", 'Gerald John Pascarelli', 'Understood. Just one more for me. I think your nonmeasured channel revenue came in a little better than expected, specifically related to Amazon at least what we were modeling for. In a lower seasonal quarter, your 4Q absolute revenue is almost in line with your second quarter, which obviously benefited from Prime Day. So any incremental color on the drivers in the quarter within that channel would be helpful if you could provide any.', 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. I mean Amazon, we had a great -- in the quarter, it was a great period. And there is a lot of timing as well within shipments and how the Amazon kind of controls or feeds inventory through their warehouses based on their algorithms. So we're going to keep shipping them. We're going to -- we're #1 energy drink right now, roughly about a 20 share in the energy category. I don't really have much color than that, but continue to drive further revenues through that channel. It is an omnichannel world, and that's something we really focus here at Celsius. We want to deliver Celsius to consumers when they want it, how they want it."", 'Jarrod Langhans', ""I think it does show too, that there is still opportunity for continued growth within the Amazon channel. So it's not necessarily slowing down suddenly just because we got to a certain spot within that. So I do see that as a continued growth opportunity for us as we look out into 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Sean McGowan with ROTH Capital Partners.', 'Sean Patrick McGowan', ""A couple of quickies here. On the sales and marketing, give some good color on what we expect in the first quarter. And I think that rate of 23% is a little higher than you had talked about for some periods in the past. Is that a good number to use for the full year of '24?"", 'Jarrod Langhans', ""I think I referred to Q1 and Q4 in my prepared remarks. And if you look at our Q1 activations and activity, we've got the Super Bowl activations we did that that we believe were very successful. We've actually got a Jake Paul fight this weekend down in Puerto Rico with another number of influencers that we support. We kicked off the MLS last week or a couple of weeks ago. We kicked off the F1 partnership. So we've got a number of things that are really rolling in Q1 to keep the momentum going. As we look at a full year basis, historically, we've been in the 22% to 24% range. We were at 20% on a year-to-date basis in 2023. I think those are kind of the data points to stick to. If we've got opportunity to invest ahead of growth, we're going to continue to invest it. We're going to spend our money wisely. John and I require an ROI on everything we do. So we're not going to spend foolishly. But if we see opportunity to push growth, we'll push growth, if we don't see it, we'll continue to lever."", 'Sean Patrick McGowan', ""Okay. And then on the Essentials line, could you give us, I mean, that's pretty rapid acceleration of ACV. Where do you think that goes? And basically, more generally, what is the plan for additional SKUs and additional outlets for that line. I'm seeing it in its own cooler or a separate cooler in some stores. Do you think this can double that? Can you get to a 80% plus ACV by the end of the year?"", 'John Fieldly', ""That's -- well, we've never launched a new line with our new distribution partner, PepsiCo. So I think we have a lot to learn. We are working hard. We think it can definitely be incremental. There is a lot of opportunity in there. That 16-ounce Celsius Essentials has been really well recepted by consumers. What's great? It's not cannibalizing existing sales. So we are bringing in additional new consumers and converting new consumers into the Celsius portfolio. So that has us really excited. It's not -- we're not trading our existing consumers. So the initial data.It's still early. When you look at it, you're only talking like 8 weeks, 12 weeks of data we have at best in certain stores. So we really need to get a little bit more data underneath our belts as we move into -- get through Q1 and most importantly, see what these resets bring that are coming out. So I think this summer, we'll have a better read on how this portfolio is going to perform the Celsius Essential line within our overall global portfolio."", 'Jarrod Langhans', ""Yes. It's a great product. You should get out and taste it, if you haven't yet."", 'John Fieldly', 'It tastes great.', 'Sean Patrick McGowan', 'I have some in my office.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley.', 'Eric Adam Serotta', ""Great. So could you give a little bit more granularity as to what drove the step-up in Pepsi revenue through the foodservice channel? I think it had been running at 10%, now it's at 12.5%. I think Jersey Mikes and Dunkin' are still very early days, and I'm not sure if those go through Pepsi, so maybe you could clarify that. But what specific channels are you seeing traction in, in foodservice through Pepsi? And then a broader question, in terms of the new SKUs that you're adding, particularly on the Vibes and the core flavors, what are you seeing in terms of incrementality there? How are the sort of legacy flavors and by legacy core and Vibes flavors performing as you're introducing these new SKUs? And then sort of what do you see as the limit for SKU count or flavor variety here, you're still a long way from Monster and Red Bull?"", 'Jarrod Langhans', ""I'll start with the foodservice one. John can have the -- all the other ones. So foodservice, I look at that as just continued momentum. I mean, if you look at our club program, once we start launching with them, we've got good progress, good momentum, but then you really see the volumes and velocity is growing. We're seeing the same thing across foodservice. We also had the college program fully in place in Q4. So as we talked about last quarter over the summer season, it tends to die down a bit when the college campus is empty out. We're also seeing great progress in the other channels within foodservice that we're in. You mentioned, Mikes, you mentioned Dunkin', there's also hospitals. There's a variety of other food establishments. And so we're just continuing to see ongoing momentum across that channel, and we're really seeing that grow and be built out. And our distributor has really been helping significantly with that. So continued momentum, and we're doing great there. But let me throw the other ones over to John."", 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. And just a further detail on that. I think we're also seeing great momentum. And you talked about the step up and Jarrod, you mentioned college universities as a big opportunity and seeing growth there. But also vending. Keep in mind, vending is also going through that foodservice and the vending, we've expanded in vending. We're seeing great results in vending. And at-work micro markets, we talked about those prior on several calls prior. The at-work micro-market opportunity is really good. I mean you see a lot of opportunities at work locations. So you're seeing the product continuing to scale. And I agree with you, Eric. I think seeing that go from 10% to 12%, just shows you the growth opportunity we have on an overall basis in this nontracked channel opportunity. Looking at new SKUs, the Vibe line, we're excited about the Vibe line, talk about the success we had, I mentioned on the comments on the call earlier that Cosmic Vibe, we launched at Circle K and really going intergalactic with the theme of Space -- the Space Odyssey with our 2 new Vibe flavors to have a Space team. We're really excited on rolling that out. We're going to have some events coming up at Coachella and a variety of neat things to -- that you, guys, will be able to see. The Vibe line is going to be a totally separate line. We're going to scale and grow that. I think there's a lot of opportunities to bring out innovative flavors and experiences with every sip. And then our core flavors, the team continues to come out with great flavors. I mean, you look at core, even expanding the core into our no Fizz line as well, where there's Blue Raspberry Lemonade that we launched at 7-Eleven in Q1 has been phenomenal. I mean the product tastes great and really expands this non-Fizz or non-carb opportunity that could be in wholly another revenue stream and ultimately an extension of our portfolio as well. So we're monitoring the SKUs. Obviously, you need to do SKU rationalization. So that's something we talk internally at innovation meetings. We'll be doing that each year. We want to -- we'll cut our, as I call it, our tail or slow-moving SKUs. But we do see consumers looking for new innovation and staying within our portfolio, which is great. So our new Sparkling Peach, Raspberry Peach is phenomenal, great flavor. Eric, try it, please go out and try it. I think you'll enjoy as much as we do."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens.', 'James Ronald Salera', 'I wanted to drill down a little bit on the coolers because I have been in Cleveland, Ohio, and I was very surprised to see a Celsius branded cooler very prominently displayed at the cash wrap of the local grocerier. And so can you just talk about kind of the channel strategy there? How you want to get those coolers placed? And then maybe as a part 2 to that question, just any color you can offer on incremental uplift, velocity, repeat rates, trial buys in locations that do have the branded fridges?', 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. Jim, it's a big, big initiative we've had over the years trying to get more cooler placement. If you've been tracking the company over the years, we've been historically sold warm. So we had to build a loyal consumer that would actually have to take the product home and chill it and then drink of the daily lifestyle and routine. And that really shows to the loyalty around the Celsius consumer. Cold availability is key to the success in order to compete in the energy category, especially with the impulse purchases. That is the biggest opportunity for us, and kind of mentioning it prior to the question, when we look at the convenience channel, that impulse purchase is key to the success of where we want to go and who we want to be in the category. So we have -- we placed about 10,000 coolers. We are investing in more coolers. We're working on placing more coolers. We want to be right at checkout. Eye-level is critical. We're talking to a variety of retailers as well, to gain additional checkout coolers. So I think that's a big opportunity. Most recently down in South Florida, if you look at Publix, we've gained checkout coolers, and we're looking to gain additional checkout coolers on the next reset. So that's a big opportunity. We do see uplift. If you're by the register and you're cold, kind of the saying we say internally here, if it's cold, it's sold. So the other thing is stacking high and watch it fly. Some comments we make around displays. But definitely a lift, the exact lift is hard to say because each channel and each store in each region is quite different on the velocity levels, but there is a substantial lift."", 'James Ronald Salera', 'Okay. Great. And maybe one follow-up on that. Are all of the actual use in the cooler consistent across the portfolio? Or do you guys make changes on that based on channel, local geography? Like could we see a Celsius lines in there? Or some of the other product innovations show up in the coolers?', 'John Fieldly', ""Yes. That's a great question. So we do have planograms and progressions we work on based on the size of the cooler. There is a little bit of regional seasonality that based on a retailer, we do exclusive flavors. So like at Circle K, we did our Cosmic Vibe. I talked about 7-Eleven, the new launch with the Raspberry Lemonade so -- Fizz-Free. So you will see potentially unique flavors and given coolers, but we do have a standard national planogram that's being followed, probably not always followed to the tea, but that is something we work on as an overall organization and work with our PepsiCo partners to keep the progressions in the coolers in accordance to our planogram.So the core should be have its own planogram, the Vibe should have a planogram and also our Fizz-Free line should have a planogram as well as our Celsius Essentials 16-ounce. So that's kind of how our go-to-market strategy."", 'Operator', ""That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand it back to John Fieldly for closing remarks."", 'John Fieldly', ""Thank you, Doug, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our Celsius Holdings Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call.

The company, known for its functional energy drinks, continues to make strides in the beverage market, with a significant 94% revenue concentration in North America. Celsius Holdings Inc's financial tables reveal a robust performance, with a notable forward stock split reflecting investor confidence. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the filing, offering investors a nuanced perspective on the company's potential."", ""Brand Innovation and Market Appeal: Celsius Holdings Inc's core strength lies in its innovative product lines, such as CELSIUS Originals, Vibe, and the newly introduced CELSIUS ESSENTIALS. These offerings cater to a diverse consumer base, particularly fitness enthusiasts, by combining nutritional science with mainstream beverage appeal. The proprietary MetaPlus formulation, free from aspartame and high fructose corn syrup, positions the company as a leader in the health-conscious segment of the energy drink market."", ""Strategic Partnerships and Distribution: The 20-year distribution agreement with PepsiCo, which holds an 8.5% stake in Celsius Holdings Inc, is a testament to the company's strategic acumen. This partnership not only bolsters the company's distribution capabilities but also enhances its market reach. The expansion of this relationship into Canada and the new agreement with Suntory Beverage & Food in the UK further solidify the company's international presence and growth trajectory."", ""Dependence on Key Distributors: A significant weakness for Celsius Holdings Inc is its reliance on PepsiCo for distribution, with sales to Pepsi constituting 59.4% of total net revenue. This concentration risks the company's operational stability should any disagreements or terminations arise. The company's financial health is closely tied to this relationship, as evidenced by receivables from Pepsi representing 69.0% of total receivables as of December 31, 2023."", ""Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: The company has faced challenges with raw material shortages, particularly aluminum cans, which are crucial for product packaging. Such shortages can disrupt production and affect financial performance. Additionally, the company's reliance on third-party manufacturing and distribution exposes it to potential inefficiencies and quality control issues that could impact its brand reputation and customer satisfaction."", ""Market Expansion: Celsius Holdings Inc's recent international agreements pave the way for expansion into new markets, such as the UK and Ireland. The company's ability to adapt and cater to diverse consumer preferences across different regions presents a significant opportunity for growth and increased market share."", ""Product Line Diversification: The introduction of the CELSIUS Essentials line demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and meeting evolving consumer demands. Continued investment in product development, particularly in the health and wellness segment, can lead to a broader product portfolio and attract new customer segments."", ""Regulatory Risks: The functional beverage industry is subject to stringent regulations by bodies such as the FDA and FTC. Any adverse actions or changes in regulations could impact Celsius Holdings Inc's operations, from product composition to marketing strategies. The company must navigate these regulatory landscapes carefully to avoid potential fines, recalls, or reputational damage."", 'Competitive Landscape: The energy drink market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for consumer attention. Celsius Holdings Inc must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to maintain its competitive edge. The company also faces the threat of private-label brands from consolidated retailers, which could exert downward pricing pressure and erode profit margins.', ""In conclusion, Celsius Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CELH) exhibits a strong foundation with its innovative product lines and strategic partnerships, particularly with PepsiCo. However, the company's heavy reliance on key distributors and potential supply chain disruptions represent vulnerabilities that require careful management. Opportunities for market expansion and product diversification are promising, but regulatory challenges and a competitive landscape pose significant threats.

The majority of urban growth, according to the UN, will occur in Global South cities, particularly in China, India, and Nigeria. Asia is projected to experience a significant rise in consumption due to its high concentration of megacities (cities with over 10 million inhabitants). However, the most substantial growth is anticipated in Africa over the next few decades. The continent's population is expected to double by 2050, with material consumption skyrocketing from 2 billion tonnes to 17.7 billion tonnes annually."", ""Most countries with the lowest urban populations are situated in Africa.

Similarly, Uganda's urban population stands at 26.2%, while its urbanization rate is 5.41%.

(AP) — The latest rail layoffs this week, combined with an investment fund's ongoing campaign for control of Norfolk Southern, are renewing concerns among unions and regulators about the effects all the cuts might have on safety and service."", 'The worries about the lean operating model the major freight railroads have embraced for several years as they cut roughly one-third of their workforce are not new. It relies on fewer, longer trains that require fewer locomotives, workers and railcars. The railroads have defended their approach as a sound strategy to make the most of their resources without jeopardizing safety. But the industry has acknowledged that service suffered particularly in 2022 after the railroads cut too deep during the pandemic.', ""All the major freight railroads — and the Ancora Holdings investors targeting Norfolk Southern — have repeatedly stressed they are committed to improving safety, especially after last year's disastrous derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Efforts to impose new safety rules on the industry have largely stalled since that crash, though the industry has taken several steps on its own like installing hundreds more trackside detectors to help spot mechanical problems."", ""But the chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, Martin Oberman, told an industry gathering this week that he believes Wall Street's focus on boosting short-term profits, stock buybacks and dividends undermines safety and service. And he said the recent investor pressure on Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific could prompt every rail CEO to back away from investing for the long run."", '“Any campaign, proxy or otherwise, that threatens to undo recent efforts to rebuild the railroad resilience and move toward significant long-term growth would be a major setback,” Oberman said. “It would undercut safety and be the opposite of good business, the opposite of fulfilling the common carrier obligation, and the opposite of meeting the congressional commandment to serve the public.”', ""Ancora maintains that Norfolk Southern is misrepresenting its plans to regulators and investors as the railroad's board tries to recruit support for CEO Alan Shaw and his strategy of keeping more workers on hand during a downturn so the railroad will be better prepared to handle the eventual rebound in shipments. The investors say their picks for CEO and operations chief want to improve safety without widespread cuts, although their plan does call for shrinking Norfolk Southern's workforce through attrition as they streamline operations over the next couple of years."", '“Our proposed CEO, Jim Barber, believes the health and safety of the company’s constituencies is the bedrock of long-term success. Our proposed COO, Jamie Boychuk, helped CSX dramatically improve customer service and go roughly two-and-a-half years without any work-related fatalities,"" Ancora said Friday in its latest letter to the board of Norfolk Southern. ""They firmly believe that the health and safety of Norfolk Southern’s people and communities are the highest priorities.”', ""Three major rail unions have jumped into the fight over Norfolk Southern and urged investors to back Shaw's strategy and his efforts to improve safety ever since the Ohio derailment."", ""BNSF laid off more than 360 mechanical employees this week — just days after Warren Buffett told shareholders of his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate that owns the railroad that he was disappointed in BNSF's profits — though that railroad said it is simply trying to shift workers to its busiest terminals. Union Pacific has also laid off several hundred workers since it named Jim Vena CEO last summer after a hedge fund pressured the railroad to change management. UP says most of those cuts were a normal seasonal move when major construction projects typically slow down because of winter."", ""The BNSF layoffs prompted a letter from the Transportation Trades Department labor coalition urging the Federal Railroad Administrator to step up inspections because unions believe these latest cuts — even though they are relatively small compared to the railroad's more than 37,000 workers — will make it even harder for the railroad to complete required repairs and inspect its locomotives and railcars."", '“BNSF workers are being pushed beyond capacity, and with these additional cuts, there is grave concern that there will be additional lapses in safety,” the unions wrote. “We are seeing this verified in real time with exhausting and unsafe overtime mandates. It is time to stop the scheme that puts profits above all else.”', 'The head of the nation\'s largest rail union, Jeremy Ferguson, added to those concerns in his own letter calling out Buffett\'s pursuit of profits at worker expense. Ferguson, who leads SMART-TD, said instead of working “harder to grow, to earn new business or expand its relationships with the customers they have” BNSF is taking the easy route to improve the bottom line by “handing out pink slips and furloughs because the executives and shareholders must get theirs first and foremost.""', ""BNSF spokeswoman Kendall Sloan said the railroad's furloughs weren't a widespread effort to cut costs. Instead, they should simply help the railroad ensure it has enough workers in areas where volume is growing across its network that crosses the western United States if workers accept incentives to move into other jobs."", '“We believe any presumption that BNSF is shifting its priority away from safety is inaccurate,"" Sloan said. ""We consider safety in every decision we make.”', ""Amit Bose, who leads the Federal Railroad Administration, said Union Pacific's furloughs since Vena took over “makes me question UP’s commitment to safety.”"", ""But Vena responded in a letter of his own Friday that “Union Pacific will never compromise the safety of our employees or of the communities where we operate.” He said Bose's comments were misleading because he lumped together seasonal track worker layoffs with the furloughs of less than 100 mechanical workers last fall after shipping volume slowed."", 'The latest federal safety statistics for all of 2023 released Friday are mixed with the number of derailments nationwide dipping slightly while the rate of accidents along the main tracks between crossings increased 8%. But Association of American Railroads spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek said the trade group believes the “data clearly demonstrate a positive trendline” even though there is still need for improvement.']"

There were no reports of injuries, although diesel fuel being carried in a tank car did spill, there were no reports of contamination or evacuations. Plastic pellets also spilled, according to the news reports.', 'In a statement provided to FreightWaves on Sunday, a spokesperson said: “Norfolk Southern crews and contractors remain at the derailment site. Members of the NTSB have arrived and are investigating. Once they have completed their investigation of the scene, we will continue with site cleanup and begin work to restore the track. The area where the locomotives were in the water will remain contained with booms until any residual sheen has been removed.”', 'Saturday’s derailment comes after two days of back-and-forth over two of the U.S.-based Class 1 railroads that left heads spinning. The scorecard for the criticism and the responses went like this:', '— Martin Oberman, chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, ripped into Ancora Associates for its proxy battle over Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) railroad. Oberman spoke to the Southeast Association of Rail Shippers 2024 Spring Meeting in Atlanta on Thursday, where he said Ancora “has nothing to say about what it could do better” than current management in running Norfolk Southern, adding, “I think we can assume that if Ancora succeeds in its bid to control NS, its next move will be to put the Brooklyn Bridge on the market.”', '— Ancora didn’t have any public response to Oberman’s comments, but on Friday, it sent a letter to the Norfolk Southern board, just a few days after the railroad released its 2024 proxy statement. The proxy revealed that in 2023 — the year when Norfolk Southern labored under the fallout from the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio — NS CEO Alan Shaw had total compensation of $13.41 million, compared to $9.78 million a year before.', '— The second blast from a government official aimed at a railroad came from Amit Bose, the administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration. In a letter addressed to UP CEO Jim Vena,', 'Bose criticized recent furloughs implemented at Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP). “It is imperative that UP prioritizes safety above all else and takes immediate steps to address this issue, an issue disproportionately affecting UP workers since your railroad continues to furlough employees at a rate, based on available data, far outpacing that of any of your Class I peers.” Bose wrote.', '— Union Pacific quickly responded to Bose’s comments with a letter from Vena, which said the FRA head was portraying an “inaccurate correlation between natural workforce fluctuations and safety.”', 'Oberman was harsh in his assessment of Ancora’s motives. “Several weeks ago, Ancora wrote me a letter,” Oberman said, according to a transcript released by the STB. “The essence of their message was that they had taken a $1 billion dollar stake in NS in order for it — quote — ‘to become a safer railroad.’ Really? What hedge fund raises $1 billion to promote safety anywhere?”', 'Oberman, as he has done before, criticized railroad focus on its operating ratio (OR), with the STB head expressing concern that a goal to reduce OR can come at the expense of both safety and performance.', '“Ancora principally and repeatedly focuses on a rapid lowering of the OR to drive cash payouts and raise its stock price, harshly criticizing present NS management for not making a lower OR the objective,” Oberman said. “We now know that this is wrong-headed thinking. Making OR the corporate objective is what led to elimination of thousands of workers which caused the service crisis.”', 'The reference to the service crisis was from earlier in his speech when he recapped STB actions to force service improvements during the enormous system backups of 2022.\xa0', 'Ancora’s Friday letter was addressed to Amy Miles, the non-executive chair of the NS board.\xa0 The letter said that Ancora — which as an activist investor has previously trained its sights on Forward Air (NASDAQ: FWRD) and C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) — said Shaw has “presided over industry-worst operating results, sustained share price underperformance and an ineffective and tone-deaf response to the preventable derailment in East Palestine.” It said Anchor had “offered viable solutions in the form of exceptional people with a strategic vision.”', 'Norfolk Southern’s stock price in the last 52 weeks is up about 14%. During that time, its fierce rival for business east of the Mississippi, CSX (NASDAQ: CSX), is up about 23.7% while Union Pacific is up 21.5%.', 'On the issue of Shaw’s pay, the Ancora letter said shareholders were “baffled” at the decision to give the CEO a raise in the same year as the East Palestine derailment and the fallout from it.', '“We challenge the Board’s determination that it had to adjust executive compensation in 2023 to', '‘retain key talent,’” Ancora said, quoting a board statement. “We do not see how the Board could have actually viewed Mr. Shaw as a flight risk. In addition to being a more than 30-year insider at Norfolk Southern, he was a relatively new, unproven CEO off to an extremely rocky start. The fact that this decision was made suggests deference to management and a lack of respect for shareholders and stakeholders.”', 'In the back-and-forth surrounding Union Pacific, Bose said UP’s decision to furlough some worker is a sign that the railroad “has again chosen to prioritize cost-cutting measures over ensuring safe operations, jeopardizing the well-being of both UP’s workers and the public.”', '“Furloughing maintenance of equipment workers puts a strain on workers across the railroad, leading to fatigue and potential errors that could have severe ramifications for both workers and the public,” Bose wrote.', 'In a letter signed by Vena, UP responded to Bose’s criticism with several key rebuttals.', '— It cited several statistical points about derailments, that “serious” derailments were down 26% in 2023 from 2019 levels, track-related derailments had declined 28% in the past 10 years, and that UP had recorded an 8.7% improvement in mainline derailments in 2023 versus 2021.', '— The Vena letter said “fluctuations in workforce needs are a natural component of operating the railroad … normal, cyclical and vary from year to year based on business needs, capital projects and weather.”', 'To support its criticism that Bose was not making distinctions among types of workers and railroad needs, Vena’s response said the Bose letter “combines different types of workers (Mechanical employees and Engineering employees) and work done on the railroad (equipment maintenance and capital projects), and therefore paints an incorrect and incomplete picture of the natural role workforce fluctuations play in operating a railroad year-round.”', '“We’ve already begun seeing an increase in demand and have more employees working in January and February of this year,” Vena wrote.', 'The letter also said workers impacted by furloughs and layoffs can apply for other positions at Union Pacific.', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'If truckers haul bread and cakes, is their business baking or trucking?', 'Deadline near for filings as Werner seeks review of nuclear verdict', 'Live on stage: The complex relationship between a trucking job and life', 'The post Amid debate over rail safety concerns, another Norfolk Southern train derails appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

This means the annual payment is 3.1% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.', ' See our latest analysis for Gap ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Gap's dividend was higher than its profits, but the free cash flows quite comfortably covered it. Given that the dividend is a cash outflow, we think that cash is more important than accounting measures of profit when assessing the dividend, so this is a mitigating factor."", ""Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 31%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated."", ""While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. There hasn't been much of a change in the dividend over the last 10 years. The dividend has seen some fluctuations in the past, so even though the dividend was raised this year, we should remember that it has been cut in the past."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Gap's earnings per share has shrunk at 45% a year over the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited."", ""Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it. We don't think Gap is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.
