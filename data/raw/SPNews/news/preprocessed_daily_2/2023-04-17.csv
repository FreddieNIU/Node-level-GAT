A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the first quarter, the fund was up 6.5% compared to a 7.5% return for S&amp;P 500 Index benchmark.  In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.Madison Investors Fund highlighted stocks The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in the first quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Westlake, Texas, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is a savings and loan holding company. On April 14, 2023, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stock closed at $50.77 per share. One-month return of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) was -10.00%, and its shares lost 38.65% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has a market capitalization of $92.336 billion.Madison Investors Fund made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We bought shares in The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) as they declined meaningfully in March. Schwab is the premier asset-gathering franchise in the brokerage industry, with particular strength in the advisory market. As one of the top two players in the retail side of the market, it has the scale economies to be a low-cost provider and compete with newcomers intent on industry disruption. In the advisory segment, where it serves independent advisors, it delivers the gold standard in service and product breadth. We believe its moat is wide, and it should grow at a healthy pace for the foreseeable future.As part of its brokerage model, Schwab operates a meaningfully sized bank, where its brokerage clients maintain deposits as part of their cash management. With over $300 billion in deposits and $500 billion in assets, if it were an independent bank, it would be one of the largest in the country. As interest rates have risen, many clients have been moving cash from low-yield bank accounts to higher-yielding alternatives, such as money-market funds. The industry calls this process cash “sorting.” For Schwab, cash sorting began about 18 months ago, and a large part of its recent stock price drop can be attributed to investor concerns that this process may accelerate. The difference for Schwab, compared to all other banks, is that when depositors pull money out, they are mostly just moving it over to other parts of Schwab! Thus, unlike traditional banks, Schwab doesn’t lose assets in the sorting dynamic. In fact, like U.S. Bancorp, Schwab appears to be a net beneficiary from the recent mini-panic in that new asset inflows have picked up as individuals flee to safety.This dynamic does cause some disruption at the bank entity, though, as client cash remains within Schwab’s total but is no longer available as deposits to fund the bank’s securities portfolio. We think Schwab has more than sufficient liquidity to deal with this. The realistic worst-case outcome is that total earnings are moderately suppressed for a period as funding costs go up, and Schwab earns less profit for every dollar invested in deposit alternatives, as compared to what it earns per dollar deposited in the bank. Despite this headwind, we believe that as long as Schwab can grow total investment assets under its umbrella over time, its earning power should also grow.”Story continuesFLEX Earnings Call Transcripteverything possible/Shutterstock.comThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.  As per our database, 74 hedge fund portfolios held The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) at the end of the fourth quarter which was 75 in the previous quarter.We discussed The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in another article and shared the list of best financial services stocks to invest in.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Financial Services Stocks To Invest In Right Now.Strategist Makes The Case For Buying The Dip In FinancialsOn April 5 BMO Capital's Chief Investment Strategist, Brian Belski, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he made the case for investing in financial services stocks and also talked about his outlook for the second half of 2023. Belski thinks that investors should ""take two steps back"" and take an analytical, logical, and long-term approach right now. According to Belski, the market has devalued financial stocks and he thinks that there are three things that this may lead to. Firstly, Belski thinks that the opposite of what happened in the aftermath of the global financial crisis will happen right now. Back then, small and medium banks were among the best performers and large banks took a tumble. Belski thinks that large banks and Canadian banks ""will be the winners"" since they have strong balance sheets and the stability that investors want right now. Secondly, Belksi expects increased M&amp;A activity for small and medium-sized banks, given the issues the are currently dealing with. Finally, Belksi noted that he thinks there is going to be ""pointed regulation"" towards the small and medium-sized banks. Here are some comments from Brian Belski:""From a fundamental perspective, tier-1 capital ratios are 400 basis points above where we were in the great financial crisis. Loan-to-deposit ratios are very steady. Held-to-maturity securities are very pointed in those banks that were the ""bad behavior"" banks. We're seeing no systemic risk. But the financials, at 14% of the market, we believe would be a Strong Overweight here and propose a great value at these levels. You don't have to own them all, you have to be very select. And from our work with rising dispersion and rising earnings growth dispersion across the market, especially on a sector level, you absolutely positively have to be a stock picker.""Story continuesBrian Belski said ""stocks lead earnings, which lead the economy"" and if the economy shows signs of weakness, the Fed will stop its hiking cycle and start cutting interest rates. Belski thinks that the market will be relatively choppy in the first half of the year, but he expects things to pick up and the market to rally in the second half of 2022.As noted by Brian Belski, financials are currently trading at attractive valuations. However, the current market environment requires investors to be a ""stock picker"" and so, we have compiled a list of the best financial services stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. Looking at where institutional investors are placing their bets can help investors determine what may work as we head into the back half of the year. Some of the best financial services stocks to buy now according to hedge funds include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below.10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Invest In Right NowPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe scanned for financial services companies in Insider Monkey's database of 943 elite money managers. We narrowed down our selection to financial services stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Along with each stock, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment, analyst ratings, and top shareholders as well. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Invest In Right Now10. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) was spotted on 74 investors' portfolios that disclosed positions worth $8.1 billion in the company. Of those, GQG Partners was the top investor in the company and held a position worth $1.4 billion.This March, Citi analyst Christopher Allen updated his price target on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) to $65 from $75 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The stock is one of the best financial services stocks to invest in right now according to hedge funds.On March 29, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) disclosed that Marianne Brown, one of the company's directors, purchased $0.26 million worth of the company's common shares.LVS Advisory made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We exited The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) during the week leading up to the Silicon Valley Bank failure at a price in the high $60s. I sent an ad hoc note to partners on March 11 discussing our decision to sell the stock but I will add some additional context here. We invested in Charles Schwab during the summer of 2022 (discussed in our Q3 2022 letter) shortly after making our investment in Interactive Brokers. While Interactive Brokers is focused on faster-growing international markets and more sophisticated traders, Charles Schwab is a more mature US business focused on retirement accounts and wealth managers. Our investment thesis was that Schwab would benefit from higher interest rates and after years of investment would begin returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders.My view changed when it became clear that liquidity would become a greater issue for all banks in early March. We believe Schwab has enough liquidity to operate its business, but we no longer believe the company is in a position to return capital. Furthermore, Schwab saw a higher degree of deposit flight in Q4 than we expected leading us to believe the problem could get worse before it gets better. Schwab may even need to raise additional equity capital to reassure the market of its liquidity position which would drastically change the risk/reward calculation of investing in the stock. While we realized a ~6% loss on our investment, our ability to quickly recalibrate our views during the early stages of the March banking crisis prevented us from losing an additional 20%+ if we had held on until today.”9. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81This April, Barclays updated its price target on Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) to $59 from $61 and reiterated an Equal Weight rating on the shares. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is one of the best financial services stocks to invest in right now, according to hedge funds.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) reported strong earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, on April 14. The company's revenue amounted to $21.45 billion, up 11.78% year over year, and outperformed revenue consensus by $1.39 billion. The company's EPS for the quarter amounted to $2.19 and beat EPS estimates by $0.50.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was a part of 81 hedge funds' portfolios that held positions worth $7.4 billion in the company. Of those, Berkshire Hathaway was the leading investor in the company and disclosed a position worth $2.49 billion.In addition to Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), hedge funds are also bullish on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).8. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87On April 14, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) announced market-beating earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported an EPS of $1.23 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.09. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $20.73 billion, up 17.83% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $669.31 million. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is placed eighth on our list of the best financial services stocks to buy now.This April, Raymond James analyst David Long upgraded Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) to Strong Buy from Outperform and revised his price target on the shares to $47 from $52.At the end of Q4 2022, 87 hedge funds were long Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) and held collective stakes worth $5.5 billion in the company. Of those, Eagle Capital Management was the dominant shareholder and held a position worth $1.1 billion.Davis Advisors made the following comment about Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“Our investment thesis for our next largest bank investment, Wells Fargo, is totally different. As is well known, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is the country’s third-largest bank, serving one in three U.S. households. Years of regulatory missteps under prior managements resulted in reputational damage, higher-than-average expenses, numerous consent orders, caps on asset growth, all added to the negative impact of low rates on their interest income. However, where others see bad news, we see resiliency and gradual improvement. Wells Fargo’s resiliency is reflected in the fact that despite years of terrible headlines and congressional hearings, Wells Fargo’s core customers stayed put and customer attrition remains extraordinarily low.As to gradual improvement, new management has made steady headway in closing consent orders, settling regulatory matters and upgrading systems. Thus, rather than increasing profits from growth, Wells Fargo’s earnings growth for the next three-to-five years should come from the combined tailwinds of rising interest income, partially offset by normalizing credit costs, reduced expenses as systems improve and the scandals of the last decade are gradually put behind them, and the return of excess capital through share repurchases and rising dividends. The hypothetical earnings bridge displayed in Figure 6 gives some sense of the earnings power we see unfolding in the years ahead for this durable financial franchise.While our grounded optimism carries the day, we are mindful of the risk that Wells Fargo’s historically excellent credit culture may have deteriorated, or that exasperated regulators may choose to extract even more major penalties for past infractions.”7. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Wall Street sees material upside to S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) and the stock is one of the best financial services stocks to invest in right now. This February, Argus analyst John Eade raised his price target on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) to $400 from $380 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares.As of April 14, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) has gained roughly 17% over the past 6 months. Moreover, according to the company's balance sheet, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) has a trailing twelve-month FCF of more than $2.5 billion.S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) was held by 97 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2022. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $7.8 billion. As of December 31, TCI Fund Management is the most prominent investor in the company and has a stake worth $3 billion.Baron Funds made the following comment about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) increased 10.1% during the quarter as investors looked past weak debt issuance activity and anticipated a potential issuance rebound in 2023. Equity markets rose during the quarter, offering some reprieve to asset-based revenue headwinds. The company also hosted an Investor Day during which management provided medium-term financial guidance of 7% to 9% annual revenue growth and low to mid-teens annual EPS growth. We continue to own the stock due to the company’s durable growth characteristics that are underpinned by the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while also benefiting from significant competitive advantages.”6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 100At the close of the fourth quarter of 2022, 100 hedge funds disclosed having stakes in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM).

7,346dceda-0217-3009-bc10-7cfbd00284ab,SCHW,2023-04-17,Those who invested in Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) three years ago are up 48%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-charles-schwab-nyse-130025635.html,1681650025,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Some The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shareholders are probably rather concerned to see the share price fall 39% over the last three months. But at least the stock is up over the last three years. However, it's unlikely many shareholders are elated with the share price gain of 42% over that time, given the rising market.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Charles Schwab achieved compound earnings per share growth of 11% per year. We note that the 12% yearly (average) share price gain isn't too far from the EPS growth rate. Coincidence? Probably not. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Charles Schwab, it has a TSR of 48% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Charles Schwab shareholders are down 38% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.7%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.3% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Charles Schwab better, we need to consider many other factors.

(AAPL) is feeling the drop in demand. It announced on Monday that its PC shipments declined 40% in the first quarter 2023. AAPL shares fell 1.6% in the wake of the news.And Apple isn’t alone: Other computer companies saw drops too. HP Inc. (HPQ) PC sales fell 24%, while Lenovo and Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) saw a drop of 30% and 31%, respectively.In the wake of Apple’s PC announcement, semiconductor stocks Micron Technology Inc. (MU) and Western Digital Corp. (WDC) shot higher on Monday and have been able to maintain their gains, as I write this Thursday morning.In today’s Market 360, we’re going to discuss the recent run-up on Micron and Western Digital, my outlook on the semiconductor market… and I’ll share which company I think will come out on top.Chips Are Still in Short SupplyOne of the biggest catalysts of the semiconductor shortage was the COVID-19 pandemic. When the world went into lockdown, factories across the globe shut their doors. And even once things were back up and running, shipping delays and massive backlog have affected everything from the auto industry to electronics.Since then, there have been many efforts to bring chip manufacturing back to the states. In August of 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act – better known as the CHIPS Act – which allocates $280 billion to different parts of the semiconductor industry. Congress has set aside $52.7 billion for semiconductor research, which includes $39 billion for domestic manufacturing.Story continuesAs a result, a number of semiconductor companies have started building new factories in the U.S. – including chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM), which has plans to open two plants in Arizona, one in 2024 and the other in 2026.Short supply and the extra drive to produce more chips will be very good for chip companies. That’s why last week when Samsung announced plans to cut its memory chip output “by a meaningful level,” competitors Micron and Western Digital rallied. On Monday, MU shares and WDC shares posted gains of 8% and 8.2%, respectively.That begs the question, is it time to jump in on these chip companies today?While I am bullish on the semiconductor market, Micron and Western Digital are not on my Buy List.My Portfolio Grader system currently lists both companies as a sell:While both companies have benefited from strength this week, long-time subscribers know my favorite semiconductor play is still NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA).One Chip Company to Rule Them AllThe Lord of the Rings pun is intended, but on a more serious note, NVIDIA really controls the semiconductor game. NVIDIA is a leading computer graphics company, making graphic processing units (GPUs) for consumers and businesses. From video games to professional visualization, datacenter and automotive applications, NVIDIA’s graphics cards enhance the processing capability of its users’ computers.The company has been in the computer graphics business for more than two decades – it invented the GPU in 1999 – so it is a well-established player. To date, NVIDIA owns more than 11,000 patents relating to computer graphics, the largest portfolio of its kind.On Wednesday, the company announced the launch of its new graphics card, the GeForce RTX 4070. This highly anticipated release will give video game players a higher-quality visual experience.The fact is, while NVIDIA got its start as a graphics card company that catered to video game enthusiasts,, it turns out that its GPUs have a wide range of powerful applications. Graphics cards can be used to aid computers in applications like financial modeling, oil and gas exploration, virtual reality and even in self-driving cars.And NVIDIA isn’t just the best chip company, it’s the best artificial intelligence (AI) company, too.In particular, its AI chips will boom under 5G. The world’s leading telecommunications companies are turning to NVIDIA’s technology to build software to increase memory and process data at faster speeds. Their AI chips will be embedded throughout Verizon Communication Inc.’s (VZN) 5G network and will also be used in cutting-edge tech like cloud-based virtual reality, smart cities, connected drones and autonomous vehicles.The company has taken steps to fine-tune its business to the current environment, as it adjusted inventory levels and introduced new products.NVDA stock was upgraded to a “Buy” in February of this year in my Portfolio Grader system. And year-to-date, the company is up 86%.If you’re looking to invest in the semiconductor space, NVIDIA is a great company to start with – but it’s not the only semiconductor stock that’s poised to do well in the current environment. There are several other semiconductor stocks that are uniquely positioned to prosper in their respective corners of the market and are backed by superior earnings and sales growth.To access my entire Growth Investor Buy List – including my favorite semiconductor picks – click here and become a member of Growth Investor today.

10,5e876ae4-4c0f-3b95-8159-b09bd92f9c86,PVH,2023-04-17,Top 10 Luxury Clothing Stocks to Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-luxury-clothing-stocks-210354634.html,1681679034,STORY,"['JWN', 'MC.PA', 'VFC', 'RL', 'GIII', 'CPRI', 'PVH', 'TPR']","[In this article, we will take a look at the top 10 luxury clothing stocks to buy. To see more such companies, go directly to Top 5 Luxury Clothing Stocks to Buy.The luxury goods market is famous for staying resilient and strong during recessionary environments. That’s because the rich and wealthy are usually the last to feel the real effects of rising inflation. Last year, when the broader turmoil in the stock market was crushing almost every other company, French luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC) was posting strong sales growth. During the company’s third quarter earnings call, answering a question about how the company was able to manage to outperform despite the difficult odds, LVMH’s CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony  very realistically pointed to a fact that explains the strength of the luxury goods market even when things start to go south:“Luxury is not a proxy for the general economy. We end up selling to affluent people and they have a behavior on their own, which is not necessarily totally aligned with economics.”During the last quarter of 2022, LVMH, along with some other luxury companies, saw a slowdown, mainly driven by COVID-19 outbreaks in China. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division posted organic sales growth of 10% during the period, which the company says was the slowest growth seen during 2022. However, the company said it started to see sales rebound in January 2023 after China reopened its economy. Jean-Jacques Guiony  said the company’s performance in China had  “recovered very significantly” in January and that “China has actually turned the page on the disruption of the pandemic.”How Does Luxury Business Remain Resilient Despite Inflation?Luxury companies like PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH), Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) and Capri Holdings Limited (NYSE:CPRI) aren’t totally immune to the economic realities, however. For example, LVMH’s chief Bernard Arnault said earlier this year that the company was “vigilant to current uncertainties.” But what makes the luxury sector strong in the face of global economic challenges is its ability to transfer rising costs to consumers. A December 2022 report from Financial Times says the prices of core handbags from Chanel and Louis Vuitton have jumped about 20% over the past two years, with more price hikes expected, especially in Europe. The report cited Citi luxury analyst Thomas Chauvet, who estimates that prices could rise by another 15% in 2023 in Europe and in the mid-single digits in the US and China.Story continuesAnother growth catalyst for the luxury sector comes from the emerging markets where wealth and consumers’ appetite to buy and boast luxury items keep increasing. Bain estimates that sales in the sector are expected to increase by a whopping 60% between 2022 and 2030, driven by the increase in luxury consumers from India, Mexico, South Korea and south-east Asia.The Benefits of Having The Top 1% As CustomersGlobal wealth increase that seems to buoy the top 1% also explains the robust growth of the luxury goods market. Bloomberg in a reported quoted data from Boston Consulting Group, which says that global wealth jumped 10.6% (adding $26 trillion) in 2021, clocking in the fastest rate in more than a decade. The coronavirus crisis also fueled consumer spending in the luxury goods market. The Bloomberg report cited Gachoucha Kretz, associate marketing professor at business school HEC Paris, who pointed to a trend he calls “revenge shopping” after the pandemic, in which consumers spend lavishly on the assumption that “life is short” and “‘I might as well enjoy today since I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.’”In this backdrop, it’s necessary to take a look at the top luxury clothing companies in which hedge funds are investing.Luxury Clothing Stocks to BuySorbis/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the holdings of 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and picked top 10 companies that make luxury clothing products.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the first quarter, the fund was up 6.5% compared to a 7.5% return for S&amp;P 500 Index benchmark.  In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.Madison Investors Fund highlighted stocks like U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in the first quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a financial service holding company. On April 14, 2023, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) stock closed at $34.97 per share. One-month return of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) was 6.13%, and its shares lost 33.66% of their value over the last 52 weeks. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) has a market capitalization of $53.567 billion.Madison Investors Fund made the following comment about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shares are ensnared in the bank-run panic that began late in the quarter. Two large banks failed in early March as depositors rushed to withdraw money on concerns that the banks would suffer from liquidity problems. That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course, but in the case of the two banks, it was prompted by the revelations of utter mismanagement of their securities portfolio. Bank models are, essentially, to borrow short and lend long. This sounds dangerous of course, and it would be if not for the deposit guarantee provided by the FDIC. The history of the U.S. banking system can be divided into two eras – pre-FDIC, when bank runs were fairly common, and post-FDIC, when bank runs have been close to non-existent. However, FDIC protection has its limits, and it remains incumbent on management to properly manage its assets and liabilities. The two banks in question didn’t do that. By taking down the share prices of all banks, we think investors are shooting first and asking questions later; they are not distinguishing between the strong and the weak.U.S. Bancorp, as one of the largest and best-managed banks in the country, appears to be a net beneficiary so far of the panic among some depositors, with a pick-up in net deposit inflows in recent weeks. We don’t dismiss the probability of industry contagion – in a true nationwide panic, the big banks will suffer along with the small banks, and the well-managed ones will suffer along with the badly-managed ones. But we think the odds of that are quite small, and recent steps by federal regulators confirm that they will do everything in their power to prevent such a scenario, given the calamitous impact that it would have on our economy. We tightly manage this risk by limiting our exposure to the banking sector.""Story continuesCreative Collage Of Business Team Working On Project And Stock Markets Data On Trasparent Screen, Financial Statistics Layered Over Man Using Laptop For Trading On Forex, PanoramaU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

21,f074ea8b-1e94-379e-a3e0-41a8e850e12c,O,2023-04-17,3 Natural Gas Stocks To Consider This Spring,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-natural-gas-stocks-consider-230000124.html,1681686000,STORY,"['SI=F', 'CL=F', 'NG=F']","[Natural gas prices have continued their relentless slide after the latest inventory data showed the markets continue to be well supplied. Natural gas (Henry Hub) prices have given up early-week gains, with prices currently sitting at $2.00 per MMBtu down from  $2.19 per MMBtu on Tuesday. EIA weekly data  revealed that gas stocks for the week ended April 7, 2023 clocked in at 1,855 Bcf vs. 1,830 Bcf for the week ended March 31, 2023, good for +25 Bcf injection vs -23 Bcf for the previous week. Gas prices are now down a staggering 56% since the beginning of the year.Unfortunately for the bulls, the short-term outlook remains bleak, with NatGasWeather saying storage surpluses are likely to expand further in the coming weeks due to light demand. Although there are some cool weather systems in the forecast, the latest weather models have trended warmer.Thankfully, the longer term outlook is likely to be more favorable. Europe has failed to secure enough long-term LNG contracts to offset cut-off Russian gas imports, with Reuters predicting this may prove costly next winter and could sharply tighten the market. The European Union views natural gas as a bridge fuel in the transition to renewable energy, and buyers generally struggle to commit to long-term contracts. This means that Europe might be forced to buy more from the spot markets like it did in 2022, which in turn is likely to push prices up:""Since the green lobby in Europe has managed to persuade politicians wrongly that hydrogen to a large extent can replace natural gas as an energy carrier by 2030, Europe has become far too reliant on spot and short term purchases of LNG,"" consultant Morten Frisch told Reuters.Related: U.S. Drilling Activity Slips FurtherSource: Business InsiderGiven this backdrop, it’s hardly surprising that it has become more profitable to short natural gas equities than bet on them: the ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas ETF (KOLD) boasts a juicy year-to-date return of 146%, incomparable to -79% return by the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas ETF (BOIL).Story continuesKOLD is an inverse ETF that provides daily -2x exposure to an index that tracks natural gas by holding one second month futures contract at a time while BOIL provides 2x the daily return of an index that measures the price performance of natural gas as reflected through publicly traded natural gas futures contracts.That said, contrarian investors betting on a gas turnaround will be delighted to know that there’s no shortage of natural gas bargains in the space. Here are a few. EQT Corp. Market Cap: $11.9BYTD Returns: 2.9%Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) is the largest natural gas producer in the United States with ~25.0 trillion cubic feet of proved natural gas, natural gas liquids, and crude oil reserves across approximately 2.0 million gross acres.EQT is not content with just being a lumbering gas giant, but has been expanding via acquisitions: in the third quarter, the company announced a $5.2 billion purchase of natural gas producer THQ Appalachia I LLC as well as associated pipeline assets of XcL Midstream in the biggest  M&amp;A deal for the quarter. THQ Appalachia, which is owned by privately held gas producer Tug Hill Operating. EQT said the assets acquired include ~90K core net acres offsetting its existing core leasehold in West Virginia, producing 800M cfe/day and expected to generate free cash flow at average natural gas prices above ~$1.35/MMBtu over the next five years. The company also doubled its buyback program to $2B, and said it is increasing its year-end 2023 debt reduction goal to $4B from $2.5B.Last year, EQT unveiled a plan centered on producing more liquified natural gas by dramatically increasing natural gas drilling in Appalachia and around the country's shale basins, as well as pipeline and export terminal capacity, which it said would not only boost United States energy security, but also help break the global reliance on coal and on countries like Russia and Iran. Its latest acquisition will, therefore, help the company meet its goal. EQT shares nearly doubled in 2022.EQT Corporation is expected to report Q4 2022 earnings on  04/26/2023 after the market closes. According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 13 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $1.38. Vs. $0.81 for Q1 2022. Antero Resources Corp (NYSE:AR)Market Cap: ~$7BYTD Returns: -16% Down 16% year-to-date, and down nearly 30% in the past six months, Antero could be a decent buying opportunity. The stock has underperformed the broader market due to the slide in natural gas prices; however, if the expected increase in demand materializes, this one could turn around quickly. Markets are volatile and fickle these days.Hedge funds are giving this one a fair amount of attention due to the potential upside given the company’s strong financials.Hedge funds view Antero as having a relatively decent ROE (return on equity), pays no dividend, but reinvests heavily into growth.That said, it’s worth noting that Wells Fargo has recently downgraded Antero from “overweight” to “equal weight”, but still gives the stock a nearly 42% upside. Cheniere Energy Inc (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG)Market Cap: $37.2BYTD Returns: 8.73% While Cheniere is up 8.73% year-to-date, it’s also shed nearly 11% in the past six months as natural gas prices take investors for a ride. But the long-term picture suggests upside for the Houston-based energy company focused primarily on LNG production, shipping and marketing.As one of the leading LNG exporters in the world, Cheniere is on solid ground long-term. However, the near-term concern is that the European Union’s natural gas storage units are still relatively full after a mild winter.. Some (including Cheniere) are worried that we could see some LNG cargo cancellations this summer as a result. Shortly after that, though, we will see another drive to fill storage ahead of the next winter season.Be on the lookout for Q1 2023 results, scheduled to be released on May 2. Last earnings season we saw Cheniere bring in $15.78 per share, with revenue of $9.1 billion.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Nuclear Fusion Is Not A Silver Bullet SolutionCould Lithium Become A More Lucrative Alternative To Fossil Fuels?Russia’s Growing Influence In Latin AmericaRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Separate readings on industrial production and retail sales are also due this week, as is a decision on lending rates by the People's Bank.This week's data is expected to largely factor into expectations that a recovery in China will drive oil demand to record highs this year- a notion that was reiterated by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday.But calls from Fed Governor Christopher Waller for more rate hikes somewhat offset this positive forecast, as the dollar strengthened and as markets second-guessed expectations for an imminent pause in interest rate hikes.Brent oil futures fell 0.4% to $86.25 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.1% to $82.36 a barrel by 21:15 ET (01:15 GMT).Oil prices recovered sharply from 15-month lows after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) announced an unexpected production cut earlier this month. Signs of tighter U.S. inventories and disruptions in supply from Iraqi Kurdistan also aided this rebound.But the rally appears to have run out of steam in recent sessions, amid increased concerns over slowing economic growth in the U.S. and other major economies, which could offset a recovery in Chinese demand.Rising interest rates are also expected to further stymie economic growth this year, especially if the Federal Reserve maintains its hawkish stance.The OPEC had warned of such a scenario in its monthly report released last week, which had in part fueled its recent production cut.Story continuesThe dollar advanced against a basket of currencies on Monday, sustaining a recovery from last week following Waller’s comments. Strength in the greenback is bearish for commodities priced in the currency.While the IEA forecast stronger global demand this year, it also warned that the recent supply cut by the OPEC could hurt consumers with higher prices, especially amid deteriorating economic conditions.Related ArticlesOil prices dip as dollar firms, Chinese data deluge in focusGold steadies above $2,000 as markets reassess Fed risksG7 ministers set big new targets for solar and wind capacity]"

To see more such companies, go directly to Top 5 Luxury Clothing Stocks to Buy.The luxury goods market is famous for staying resilient and strong during recessionary environments. That’s because the rich and wealthy are usually the last to feel the real effects of rising inflation. Last year, when the broader turmoil in the stock market was crushing almost every other company, French luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC) was posting strong sales growth. During the company’s third quarter earnings call, answering a question about how the company was able to manage to outperform despite the difficult odds, LVMH’s CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony  very realistically pointed to a fact that explains the strength of the luxury goods market even when things start to go south:“Luxury is not a proxy for the general economy. We end up selling to affluent people and they have a behavior on their own, which is not necessarily totally aligned with economics.”During the last quarter of 2022, LVMH, along with some other luxury companies, saw a slowdown, mainly driven by COVID-19 outbreaks in China. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division posted organic sales growth of 10% during the period, which the company says was the slowest growth seen during 2022. However, the company said it started to see sales rebound in January 2023 after China reopened its economy. Jean-Jacques Guiony  said the company’s performance in China had  “recovered very significantly” in January and that “China has actually turned the page on the disruption of the pandemic.”How Does Luxury Business Remain Resilient Despite Inflation?Luxury companies like PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH), Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) and Capri Holdings Limited (NYSE:CPRI) aren’t totally immune to the economic realities, however. For example, LVMH’s chief Bernard Arnault said earlier this year that the company was “vigilant to current uncertainties.” But what makes the luxury sector strong in the face of global economic challenges is its ability to transfer rising costs to consumers. A December 2022 report from Financial Times says the prices of core handbags from Chanel and Louis Vuitton have jumped about 20% over the past two years, with more price hikes expected, especially in Europe. The report cited Citi luxury analyst Thomas Chauvet, who estimates that prices could rise by another 15% in 2023 in Europe and in the mid-single digits in the US and China.Story continuesAnother growth catalyst for the luxury sector comes from the emerging markets where wealth and consumers’ appetite to buy and boast luxury items keep increasing. Bain estimates that sales in the sector are expected to increase by a whopping 60% between 2022 and 2030, driven by the increase in luxury consumers from India, Mexico, South Korea and south-east Asia.The Benefits of Having The Top 1% As CustomersGlobal wealth increase that seems to buoy the top 1% also explains the robust growth of the luxury goods market. Bloomberg in a reported quoted data from Boston Consulting Group, which says that global wealth jumped 10.6% (adding $26 trillion) in 2021, clocking in the fastest rate in more than a decade. The coronavirus crisis also fueled consumer spending in the luxury goods market. The Bloomberg report cited Gachoucha Kretz, associate marketing professor at business school HEC Paris, who pointed to a trend he calls “revenge shopping” after the pandemic, in which consumers spend lavishly on the assumption that “life is short” and “‘I might as well enjoy today since I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.’”In this backdrop, it’s necessary to take a look at the top luxury clothing companies in which hedge funds are investing.Luxury Clothing Stocks to BuySorbis/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the holdings of 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and picked top 10 companies that make luxury clothing products.

According to a new survey from Realtor.com® and HarrisX, the vast majority (86%) of those planning to sell their home in the next 12 months are also planning to buy a new home.

In fact, 82% of these seller-buyers feel ""locked in"" by their currently low mortgage rate. As a result, more than half of seller-buyers (56%) who are planning to sell in the next 12 months said they are waiting for rates to come down, while 25% need to sell soon for personal reasons.""One positive aspect that came out of the pandemic was historically low mortgage rates – and many people took advantage of this opportunity to buy their first home, upgrade to a more expensive home or refinance the home they were in,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Unfortunately, this comes with a bit of a catch-22, as homeowners who locked in a 30-year fixed rate in the 2-3% range don't necessarily want to give that up in exchange for a rate in the 6-7% range.""Home equity at all-time highsThe good news for sellers is that they have a lot of equity in their current home. Eighty-five percent of potential sellers are happy with the amount of equity they have in their home. Specifically, 74% estimate that they have more than $100,000 in home equity and 20% estimate that number to be more than $300,000.Sellers still have sky-high expectationsDespite higher mortgage rates, sellers still have high expectations for their home sale, in many cases even higher than potential sellers who were surveyed in Aug. 2022. Thirty-three percent of potential sellers said that they want to take advantage of the current market and think they can make a profit. Even in this shifting market:Story continues43% expect to get their asking price (up from 27% in 2022)37% expect to have an offer within a week (compared to 33% in 2022)35% expect buyers to be willing to forgo contingencies like inspections and appraisals to make the deal (compared to 30% in 2022)34% expect an all-cash offer (up from 22% in 2022)31% expect to get more than their asking price (compared to 30% in 2022)27% expect a bidding war to take place (compared to 32% in 2022)""Given the changing housing market, it's important for buyers and sellers alike to have realistic expectations heading into a home sale,"" said Hannah Jones, Realtor.com® economic data analyst. ""By understanding the local market, sellers can make sure that they're pricing their home well to help ensure a quick sale and avoid a home that lingers on the market.""Survey MethodologyThe survey was conducted online from Feb. 3-10, 2023, among 2,286 adults in the U.S. by HarrisX. The sampling margin of error of this poll is +/- 2.1 percentage points and larger for subgroups. The results reflect a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Results were weighted for age by gender, region, race/ethnicity, and income where necessary to align them with their actual proportions in the population.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo - DADO RUVIC/REUTERSPolicy experts and pundits are very excited about the idea that artificial intelligence (AI) will revolutionise the workplace. Perhaps it will, just not in the way they suppose.For instead of making people redundant, ChatGPT may soon be empowering the most redundant people that your organisation employs. A cartoon by Tom Fishburne captures this expectation. It shows two employees, each in their own office cubicle. “AI turns this single bullet point into a long email I can pretend I wrote,” says the first. Over in another part of the firm, a second employee enthuses: “AI makes a single bullet point out of this long email I pretend I read”.If modern office work is really acting, then some employees really excel at looking busy. They are, as Bing Crosby once sang, “busy doing nothing … finding lots of things not to do”.The core of the joke is that the latest AI chatbots will allow non-productive staff to look busier than ever: the AI is a sexy new prop for their performance. In turn, they will be able to devote more of their day to their personal activities at their employer’s expense, while giving them a ticket to the hottest technology show in town, one that will look great on their LinkedIn profile.There’s much more idle and non-productive time at work than anyone wants to admit. But Fishburne’s cartoon also highlights another awkward truth. In the past, technology replaced human labour. Instead, information technology today creates and emboldens our workplace bureaucrats.Undated handout photo issued by Microsoft of Satya Nadella, Microsoft chief executive, who has announced the new version of the Bing search engine which is powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT technology. The firm announced it is expanding the preview to its Bing and Edge web browser mobile apps and will continue to add more users who sign up for the waiting list to test the new tools. Issue date: Wednesday February 22, 2023. PA Photo. The revamped search engine uses OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, a form of generative AI which is able to respond to queries and hold human-like conversations with users as they interact with it.

Another great hype, “machine to machine” (M2M) communications, was also supposed to remove expensive human oversight and deliver us productivity savings.So isn’t it time we cashed the cheque for some of these promises, and saw the results in our GDP and productivity figures?  Alas, digital technology doesn’t seem to be delivering. Since the financial crash of 2008, there has been precious little labour productivity growth in the UK.Story continues“We have a collective historical memory that technological progress brings a big and predictable stream of revenue growth across most of the economy. When it comes to the web, those assumptions are turning out to be wrong or misleading,” wrote Tyler Cowen a decade ago, in a pamphlet called The Great Stagnation.Perhaps the savings made by deploying digital technology have been real, but simply swallowed up by non-productive work popping up somewhere else in the firm.“It’s amazing that we’re as productive as we are, and half of what we do is compliance,” says Christopher Snowden of the Institute of Economic Affairs.That’s a good place to start looking. Historically, an organisation had a department called “Personnel”, which did little more than collect references and process the payroll.But in recent years, it has expanded its remit enormously, concerning itself with the employees health and “well-being”, which allowed it to intrude into how the employees behave.The empire of Human Resources is very extensive indeed. HR will not only have crafted the employee handbook, but perhaps the mission and values statements too: things we never knew we needed until recently. The UK now employs over 400,000 people in human resources roles, almost as many people as work in agriculture. It provides a sinecure for the recent explosion of graduates, and a kind of secular manners and behaviour police.Another culprit for the failure of technology to improve productivity may be, as Cowen suggests, the technology industry itself.The venture capitalist Keith Rabois sparked a lively debate recently discussing the layoffs at large technology firms. “There's nothing for these people to do ... It's all fake work,” he lamented. Over at Twitter, Elon Musk has dispensed with two thirds of its staff and contractors and the service remains much the same as it was before.Into this delicate and complex sociological picture comes ChatGPT, the parrot that has swallowed the internet and can burp it back up again quite brilliantly. ChatGPT replicates the administrative formalities that consume a bureaucrat’s day.While many of us would see this as an opportunity to identify and remove those redundant processes and posts, a canny idler spies the chance to entrench them. No productivity savings will be found if they succeed.As Amazon’s CEO Andy Jassy pointed out last week, all this marvellous AI magic doesn’t come cheap. Today’s large language models cost billions of dollars to train. Silicon Valley will need to recoup that somehow. So we may well wake up to a day where our enterprises are no more productive than they were before, but must pay an additional service charge to Silicon Valley simply to keep their AI-toting bureaucrats looking busy.Revolutions have started over less.]"

(NASDAQ:META) (formerly Facebook), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc.

According to Dan Flax, right now the market is focusing on the growth potential of tech companies for 2023 and into 2024, and he thinks that the cost cutting measures that tech companies are taking will lead to improved free cash flow and earnings growth as we head into 2024. Here are some comments from Dan Flax:""I think the market is focusing on the innovation and growth potential of these companies later this year, and into next year. You couple that with, we saw the move from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), they're starting to take a much more aggressive stance in terms of managing costs. If they are able to do that, I suspect what we'll see is that free cash flow and earnings growth will improve over the next year, and so that's what I think the market is focused on.""Story continuesSome of the stocks that Dan Flax likes include Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) has ""an underappreciated opportunity"" in its cloud segment.Other than Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) cost-cutting measures, Dan Flax likes the company's ""growth prospects in cloud"" even though the company is experiencing similar cyclical pressures such as those that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is experiencing. Dan Flax thinks that e-commerce ""will continue to become more important to buyers and of course to third-party sellers"".Dan Flax is bullish on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) because the company is transitioning its business and he is seeing ""traction in reels"".Finally, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of Dan Flax's top picks among the FAANGs. Though Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is experiencing some consumer-facing pressures, Dan Flax likes the company because its ""product cycles are healthy"" and ""the installed base in iPhone is growing, and the services business remains robust"".Dan Flax also addressed concerns about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) falling behind in generative AI, particularly in light of the growing popularity of ChatGPT. Flax reassured that Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Speaking of fresh names, we established a new position in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during the second half. We began accumulating shares after the company reported two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses, which brought the stock down by about 75% from peak to trough. Our investment in Netflix is a good example of what we categorize as a “temporary dislocation” and a great example of the historical investments we’ve made in the tech sector. Unlike other “value” investors, we don’t arbitrarily put tech in the “too hard” pile. We are comfortable and more than happy to underwrite investments in the industry. We just demand a margin of safety when doing it (something often ignored by other investors in the industry). That margin of safety opened up when consensus quickly concluded that Netflix’s growth was over, on the heels of two quarters of subscriber losses, which happened to follow years of surging lock-down-induced demand. The popular narrative was that by pursuing advertising revenue, Netflix was all but admitting that streaming television was completely saturated. We thought otherwise. With ~ 75MM subscribers in the US, even converting a small portion of those 100MM moochers would move the needle3. And given the superiority of the company’s technology and first-party user data, we think the consensus is completely underestimating the long-term potential of a Netflix advertising model.”Some of analysts' and hedge funds' top tech stock picks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Cheap Retail Stocks to Buy.While the stock market crash of 2022 left a devastating impact on investor portfolios, long-term analysts believe the selloff has created some solid buying opportunities for investors who can wait. In its 2023 outlook report, JPMorgan said that lower valuations as a result of the 2022 market decline created “best long-term return potential in more than a decade.” The report said that despite the chances of a recession and several quarters of low growth, JPMorgan’s forecast for global trend growth over its 10- to 15-year investment horizon remains unchanged at 2.20%. Because the market is currently offering discounts for those who know where to look, we decided to discuss some retail stocks that have a lot of room to run in terms of their share price appreciation, according to Wall Street analysts. Our area of focus in this article would be the retail industry. Before diving into the list of cheap retail stocks, let’s first take a look at some industry dynamics of the retail world.While major retailers posted strong Q4 earnings reports, their management teams were frank enough to share the uncertainties that lie ahead due to rising inflation and slowing consumer spending. For example, Best Buy’s management said that the company was preparing for another low year and more volatility.Another major retailer Lowe's also warned investors about the headwinds to come. Lowe’s CFO Brandon Sink said the following in the company’s latest earnings call:“Given elevated levels of inflation, higher interest rates, and a more cautious consumer, we are forecasting a slight decline in the home improvement market. We expect to continue to outperform the market in 2023 with sales ranging from $88 billion to $90 billion. Comparable sales are expected to be in a range of flat to down 2%. Keep in mind that 2023 comparable sales will be calculated based on weeks two through 53 in fiscal 2022. Pro sales growth is expected to exceed DIY again in 2023 and as we expect to continue to outpace the broader Pro market growth by 2x.”Story continuesConsumer spending in the US still remains strong. In February, consumer spending jumped 0.2%. In January, consumer spending logged its biggest increase since March 2021. As JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon recently noted in an interview, consumers are spending 10% more than last year and 40% more than before the pandemic. Dimon said that consumers still have enough excess money to spend until the end of this year. If the Federal Reserve begins to pause and eventually cut interest rates and we see a soft landing instead of a full-blown recession, US retailers could see the volatility recede and sales come back to normal.Amid the rising inflation, consumers in the US are changing their spending patterns. Throughout 2022 and 2023, the continued rise in spending on travel and recreation have confused analysts. How could Americans keep spending on leisure when inflation is high and layoffs are rampant? One of the reasons behind this trend is that people are cutting back on buying stuff and spending more on activities and experiences. This trend was highlighted by Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail during the company’s Q4 earnings call in the following words:Beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported strong sales and earnings growth driven by ticket while transactions steadily normalized back towards 2019 levels as the broader consumer economy shifted from goods and back into services. During this time, we continued to report positive sales growth in every quarter up to present. As we set targets for 2023, the context of the past three years led us to consider three factors that will likely influence our performance this year. First, the starting point for our target setting this year is our assumption regarding consumer spending. We've assumed like many economists that we will see flat real economic growth and consumer spending in 2023. Second, over the last seven quarters, we have seen our transactions gradually normalize as consumer spending has shifted from goods to services. We believe that if this shift continues at its current pace, the home improvement market would be down low-single digits.Cheap Retail Stocks to BuyPhoto by Dennis Siqueira on UnsplashDespite these challenges, the long-term outlook for the retail industry is strong and there are several retail stocks that are trading at a discount.Our MethodologyFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify retail stocks whose price targets set by Wall Street analyst are much higher than their current stock prices as of April 4. We were able to find at least 30 stocks that have upside potential from their current levels based on analyst price targets.

(NYSE:BBWI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We initiated a position in Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (NYSE:BBWI) earlier in the year that we added to significantly in the Fourth Quarter. The company, which sells personal care and home fragrance products, separated from Victoria’s Secret in late 2021 and has struggled to find its footing in the public markets. Bath &amp; Body Works was challenged by the normalization of trends following the pandemic, but also suffered from execution hiccups that made matters worse. On the operations front, the company spent much of 2022 without a permanent CEO, cut guidance multiple times given inventory and cost pressures, and did a poor job communicating meaningful increases in the company’s cost structure as a standalone business. On the capital allocation front, the execution of an accelerated share repurchase program was sloppy at best.Despite these recent struggles, we believe BBWI can change its equity story, improve its earnings power, and earn a more premium valuation. The recent appointment of a new CEO, Gina Boswell from Unilever, is an encouraging first step…” (Click here to read the full text)7. PDD Holdings Inc.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Boring Stocks That Pay Dividends.The 2022 market crash and the broader retreat of growth stocks has established one thing: boring is better when it comes to stock investing during volatile times. The euphoric optimism that started after the pandemic on the back of easy money and sky-high valuations abruptly ended in 2022 with painful losses for growth investors who were betting on exciting, flashy tech companies whose profits lie far into the future. On the other hand, so-called “boring” companies which hardly make daily headlines in stock market news, trade on realistic valuations and generate a lot of cash selling stuff that remains important for people took all the limelight during the year. This value outperformance is expected to continue in 2023 as well as financial markets continue to face the effects of rising inflation, increasing interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty.Earlier this year, Bloomberg quoted Goldman Sachs analyst Peter Oppenheimer, who said that value stocks are expected to outperform growth stocks in 2023 as “big cap technology sees further margin pressure, commodity prices rise and real interest rates remain higher.” Oppenheimer is just one of the many famous investors who were calling for a major tech stocks rout. Morgan Stanley’s famous bear Mike Wilson, who got fame for foreseeing the stock market crash of 2022, also said in March that he was seeing a further 20% downside on some major tech and meme stocks.In January, Wilson said that he was expecting a “nasty earnings recession and the companies that can deliver on cost efficiency will be the ones that can continue to perform.”Which companies can deliver on cost efficiency? You guessed it right. Boring companies that make money. Boring companies with prudent business models, realistic valuations and years of dividend growth will be our focus in this article today because these are the companies that are expected to deliver well despite the financial crunch and recession which could last for months or years to come.Story continuesDuring the start of 2023, the US stock market showed signs of a rebound based on hopes that inflation in the country might be getting under control and the Federal Reserve was on path to pause rate hikes. However, subsequent weeks dashed these hopes as data showed the resilience of the labor market and stubborn inflation. However, an important question to ask is: will value stocks continue to perform well if the stock market starts to rebound in the second half of 2023? Is this the right time to pile into boring value stocks? Last year, Northern Trust published some interesting data points citing Chief Investment Officer for Global Equities Michael Hunstad. These data points may answer this question.Why Should You Invest in Boring Stocks?The Northern Trust  report said that since 1970, there have been six technical recessions in the United States. During six technical recessions in the US since 1970, equity market performance ranged from a 30% decline to a slight increase. However, in the year immediately following these recessions, stock market returns average 22% with value outperforming growth by more than 4% points.In technical recessions coupled with high inflation, value outperformed growth by over 10% points.Here’s what the report added about the expected outperformance of value stocks:“Today's macroeconomic and market picture supports this view. With sustained high inflation, further rate hikes on the horizon, and declining business and consumer sentiment value stocks may have a long runway. And despite recent outperformance, value stocks haven't become overly expensive, adding credence to a continued value tilt.”Boring Stocks that Pay DividendsWhy Dividend Stocks?While value stocks shined in 2022, what took the most of the limelight last year were not-so-boring dividend stocks. Dividend stocks provided a safe haven to investors who were looking for a refuge amid a ruthless economic turmoil. Dividend stocks in 2022 made history and cemented the already-studied phenomenon which says dividend stocks perform better during recessionary periods and high inflation. Earlier this year,  Alec Young, MAPsignal's Chief Investment Strategist, gave an interview to BNNBloomberg about dividend stocks and their performance during inflationary periods. Young said that dividends account for about 40% of the total stock market returns over the long run.Young said that his firm dug some data and found that dividend stocks do “best when inflation is high like it is now.” Young said that when CPI inflation in the US is between 6% and 7%, dividend stocks outperform non-dividend paying stocks by the widest margins of any other type of inflation environment that we looked at.Young added that this dividend stocks outperformance was across the board and wasn’t peculiar to say high-yield dividend stocks or dividend growth stocks. He said that dividend stocks fell by mid-single digits in 2022 as compared to the 19% decline for the S&amp;P 500. He was expecting this outperformance to continue in 2023.""Companies that Make Real Things and Do Real Things""At the core of any investment thesis propending to buy boring stocks is the rationale that companies that make essential items that sell irrespective of the economic cycle are positioned well to weather any economic storm. As Jim Cramer, probably one of the least boring personalities in the stock investing space, said in a program last year:“If you took your cue from me and bought common stocks of companies that make real things and do real things that return capital and trade at a reasonable valuation, you’re relatively fine.”Cramer also identified the “problem” with these boring yet solid companies:“The problem is those stocks that go down less … they’re really boring.”Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings and picked top 11 boring companies — companies that aren’t much sexy, have dull but solid, top-selling products and services — that pay dividends.Boring Stocks That Pay Dividends11.

37,2117069c-8574-3623-8391-63f637ab4906,ADM,2023-04-17,10 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-fertilizer-stocks-buy-105310810.html,1681728790,STORY,['ADM'],"[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best fertilizer stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.In 2022, global fertilizer prices had hiked to near-record levels, which spelled trouble for crop production in 2022 and even in 2023. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the limited and expensive supply of fertilizers was damaged further, resulting in shortage concerns through 2022 and well into 2023 as well. Such concerns are unsubstantiated, considering the fact that Russia is the world's largest supplier of fertilizers. The country accounts for about 45% of the global ammonia nitrate market and 18% of the potash market, for instance. As a result, the global community is heavily reliant on Russian fertilizer products, a reliance they are attempting to let go of in light of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.Fertilizer Market Situation in 2023According to the United States Foreign Agricultural Service, the US was able to avoid the surge in fertilizer prices in the aftermath of the Russian invasion because it had purchased most of its fertilizers from the country in 2021. However, this was expected to provide only temporary relief since the conflict is still ongoing. Despite this bleak outlook, the situation today has moderately improved. According to the World Bank's Food Security Update from March 23, fertilizer prices fell from their 2022 peaks this March because of shifting supplies and trade linkages. Countries that had been heavily reliant on Russia before the invasion of Ukraine managed to find alternative sources for their fertilizer imports. For example, Brazil began increasing its potash imports from Canada, while Morocco began sourcing ammonia from Egypt and Saudi Arabia.The US is also taking steps to increase American-made fertilizer production in 2023. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $29 million grant offer in March, which was focused on projects aimed at increasing American fertilizer production. Such a move is bound to bring American fertilizer companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) on par with Canadian fertilizer companies like Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), which are benefitting from increased supply demands. This grant is the first in an expected series of grants from the $3 billion fund the USDA currently holds for the promotion of innovative domestic fertilizer production capacity.Story continuesImpact of US Grants on American Fertilizer CompaniesSeveral examples of American fertilizer producers demonstrate how the above-mentioned grants are already beginning to help US-based companies. Pursell Agri-Tech LLC, a manufacturer of controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) based in Alabama, has been offered $4.9 million to assist the company with working capital and to increase its inventory by 40,000 tons per year. Palindromes Inc., based in Missouri, has also been offered $4.9 million to expand its use of anaerobic digestion and renewable energy in the production, processing, and sale of climate-smart fertilizer. Finally, Perfect Blend LLC, based in Washington, has been offered $2.6 million to help the company expand its manufacturing and processing of raw manure and fish waste into fertilizer by using the company's patented technology. The examples of these companies show the on-ground impact of the US government's steps to increase domestic fertilizer production at a time when the fertilizer market is vulnerable.These steps, which the US government began taking in September 2022, have already begun to make a difference in the American fertilizer market. In light of these developments, we have compiled a list of the best fertilizer stocks to buy today according to hedge fund sentiment.Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainLet's now take a look at the 10 best fertilizer stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Our MethodologyFor our list below, we have selected fertilizer stocks, including nitrogen fertilizer producers and agricultural technology companies that are transforming the use of fertilizers today.

The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) manufactures, markets, and sells products in the fertilizers and agricultural chemicals sector.

Their total stake value was $153 million.Madison Funds, managed by Madison Investment Management, mentioned The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Stock selection was the poorest for us in this sector. Two stocks in particular – Hain Celestial (HAIN) and The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) – while big winners for us in 2020 and 2021, hurt the portfolio in 2022.While both companies were so-called COVID beneficiaries (businesses that benefited from consumers staying home and spending on their homes during COVID), we felt they possessed certain additional drivers that would maintain their fundamentals into 2022 and beyond.Scott’s Miracle-Gro is arguably one of the great American franchises. The brand is synonymous with lawn care and pest control, has a dominant market share (~60%) with historically-impressive ~30% cash flow margins, and has the country’s largest Cannabis supply business. Scotts’ core business saw a significant windfall during COVID lockdowns. Lawn and garden care is not a growth business, and SMG dominance does not allow for much incremental gain in market share. However, our thesis was that even in a reopening scenario where lawn and garden businesses would revert to the mean, the cannabis market was poised for years of growth as more states legalized recreational use.What we missed was the highly inefficient structure of the U.S. cannabis market. Currently, California, Colorado, and Michigan have the biggest and most mature markets. However, over the course of the last few years, several very large states and regions have voted to legalize recreational use, including New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The fly in the ointment has been Oklahoma, which is a medical marijuana state. Although recreational use is still prohibited, licenses to grow the crop were granted in Laissez Faire fashion to anyone willing to buy one. Oklahoma began to grow and cultivate the crop far in excess of their medical marijuana demand. That excess supply bled into grey markets across the country, devastating pricing for growers in other states. This glut put a near complete stop to capital spending on grow operations. With no new or incremental facilities coming on, Scotts’ Hawthorne business was cut in half from its peak in F21. This, of course, had a devastating effect on the stock.”8. FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) provides crop protection, plant health, and professional pest and turf management products.

(NYSE:GS) stock rose 3.7% last week, insiders who sold US$18m worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Selling at an average price of US$363, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs GroupThe President &amp; COO, John Waldron, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$387 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$337. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$558m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs Group Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Goldman Sachs Group shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Goldman Sachs Group insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

(NYSE:TJX). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$82.72 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$73.54. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether TJX Companies' current trading price of US$77.19 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at TJX Companies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies What Is TJX Companies Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 8.21% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TJX Companies today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $71.34, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, TJX Companies has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will TJX Companies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. TJX Companies' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 39%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TJX’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock?

While several sectors might be impacted, a recession is not necessarily bad news for all. In fact, there are many sectors where we can still find some of the best stocks for recession.It’s important to understand why investors should not panic in a recession scenario. First, equities discount events in advance and it’s likely that the recession factor is priced in the market. Furthermore, policymakers shift stance in a recession towards expansionary monetary policies. The government, invariably, focuses on stimulus packages. These potential actions are good for the markets as it boosts liquidity in the financial system.I would therefore focus on some of the best stocks for recession that can best index returns in the coming quarters. Most of the stocks discussed are low-beta stocks and ensure capital preservation and regular cash flow through dividends. Let’s discuss seven of the best stocks for recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNEMNewmont Corporation$51.05RIOTRiot Platforms$13.47CVXChevron$172.23PFEPfizer$41.54LMTLockheed Martin$491.70COSTCostco$497.94GOLDBarrick Gold$20.10Newmont Corporation (NEM)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockGold is already trending higher and I believe that the positive momentum is likely to sustain in a recession scenario. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is possibly the best proxy exposure to gold. The gold miner has an investment grade balance sheet and strong cash flow visibility.Newmont closed 2022 with a total liquidity buffer of $6.7 billion. For the period, the company’s net-debt-to-adjusted- EBITDA was 0.5x. The company also reported a healthy operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for 2022.With gold trading above $2,000 an ounce, the operating cash flow is likely to be in excess of $5 billion for the year. This would imply higher investments coupled with increased shareholder rewards. NEM stock currently offers a dividend yield of 3.2% and I expect healthy dividend growth if the rally for gold sustains. Overall, with strong fundamentals, robust cash flows, and an attractive dividend yield, NEM stock is attractive.Story continuesRiot Platforms (RIOT)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockIt’s worth noting that gold and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) have been some of the top performing assets in the first few months of 2023. I believe that Bitcoin will surge higher in a recessionary scenario, backed by a weak dollar. That being said, BTC mining stocks like Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) appear attractive.A strong balance sheet is a key reason to like Riot Platforms. The company ended 2022 with zero debt and $230 million in cash. Further, Riot holds 7,058 Bitcoin in its balance sheet. High financial flexibility will support aggressive growth plans.Riot has already been boosting mining capacity and expects capacity of 12.5EH/s by the second half of 2023. Last year, the company reported Bitcoin mining gross margin of 60.3%. Being a low-cost producer is another advantage for Riot. For the current year, healthy cash flows can be expected if Bitcoin remains in an uptrend.Chevron (CVX)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comIt’s interesting to note that oil has recovered quickly from 2023 lows of $65. There are two reasons for this sharp recovery. First, OPEC and its allies recently cut production to ensure that price is supported at higher levels. Further, the recession factor is discounted in the price and a potentially weak dollar will be positive for energy prices.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock has trended higher by 7% in the last six months. This is amidst volatility in oil price. I expect CVX to breakout on the upside in a recession scenario. Besides the weak dollar factor, investors will look for an investment grade balance sheet and healthy dividends. CVX stock is fundamentally strong and offers a dividend yield of 3.57%.It’s also worth noting that Chevron reported operating cash flow of $47.5 billion in 2022. With low break-even assets, OCF will remain strong even if oil is in the range of $80 to $90 per barrel. This will ensure sustained dividends and continued share repurchase.Pfizer (PFE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7In general, investors look for defensive low-beta stocks in a recession scenario. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), for example, is among the best in this segment and looks undervalued. PFE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.3 and offers a dividend yield of 3.9%.As funds flow into safe stocks with an attractive yield, PFE stock is likely to trend higher. Of course, the pharmaceutical sector is relatively immune to economic shocks.In terms of business development, there are two points to note. First, Pfizer has a deep pipeline of 110 drug candidates. The late-stage pipeline is attractive and will ensure steady revenue growth.Furthermore, Pfizer has witnessed significant cash inflow from the sale of covid-19 vaccines. The company is utilizing the improved financial flexibility for acquisition driven growth. The company expects to add $25 billion in incremental revenue from business development deals by 2030. Therefore, the overall outlook for Pfizer is optimistic and I would remain invested at current valuations.Lockheed Martin (LMT)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) also has a low-beta and offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.46%. With a forward P/E of 18, LMT stock looks undervalued and can trend higher as investors flee to safer stocks with an investment grade balance sheet.It’s worth noting that Lockheed has been benefiting as geopolitical tensions escalate. My point is underscored by the fact that the company’s order backlog has swelled to $150 billion as of Q4 2022. On a year-on-year basis, Lockheed reported a 11% growth in backlog.A healthy backlog provides clear cash flow visibility for the year and 2024. Last year, Lockheed reported free cash flow of $6.1 billion. Even if FCF remains stable at these levels, there is ample headroom for value creation.From a growth perspective, Lockheed has been investing in new technology like hypersonics. Further, orders from Europe are likely to improve in the coming years. LMT stock would therefore remain attractive even after an economic recovery.Costco Wholesale (COST)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) declined by 15% over the last 12 months. This does not come as a surprise with the retail sector being impacted by inflation. However, in a recession scenario, I expect a breakout to the upside for the stock.It’s important to note that the U.S. economy is consumption driven with retail spending being a key component. To pull the economy out of recession, policymakers are likely to focus on boosting consumption spending. This will benefit retailers in a recession scenario.I must also mention that Costco has been reporting decent numbers amidst challenges for the sector. For Q3 2023, the company reported 6.5% growth in revenue on a year-on-year basis to $54.24 billion. Potentially lower interest rates in the second half of 2023 or in 2024 will benefit Costco.I like the fact that Costco generates $4.3 billion in membership fee annually. With a high renewal rate and warehouse expansion, growth in recurring revenue will support cash flows.Barrick Gold (GOLD)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comBarrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) is another gold mining stock that I would buy and hold in a recession scenario. GOLD stock has edged higher marginally by 10% for year-to-date 2022. I believe that the best part of the rally for the stock is due in the coming quarters.Barrick Gold has an investment grade balance sheet and high cash flow potential. The company ended 2022 with a cash buffer of $4.4 billion. Further, operating cash flows for the year were $3.5 billion. At current gold price, it’s likely that OCF will be exceeding $5 billion. This would imply healthy dividend growth.The company is also attractive considering the asset base. Barrick ended 2022 with 76 million ounces in gold reserves. With strong financial flexibility, the company has clear cash flow visibility in the coming years.I must also mention that the company has guided for an all-in-sustaining-cost of less than $1,200 an ounce. Assuming a scenario where gold is in a long-term uptrend, EBITDA margin expansion will be significant.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

52,70c11763-0b9d-32f5-8938-13cd69a29db9,NEM,2023-04-17,7 Ways to Play Silver Before Prices Go Parabolic,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-ways-play-silver-prices-193417066.html,1681414457,STORY,"['HG=F', 'SI=F', 'GC=F', 'WPM', 'PSLV', 'ASM', 'NEM']","[Thanks to the myriad economic dynamics stemming from the post-pandemic new normal, astute market participants are seeking various methods on investing in silver. Fundamentally, silver represents one of the most valuable industrial assets. It garners intense interest among multiple manufacturers because silver is the world’s best conductor of heat and electricity.Further, because of intense demand, silver appears to be in shortage, according to a CNBC report earlier this year. With few other viable alternatives to the white metal, industrial users have little choice but to pay more. Because of this basic equation, interest regarding investing in silver spiked up. Below are seven ways to play the silver game before prices go parabolic.SLViShares Silver Trust$23.73SILJETFMG Prime Junior Silver Miners ETF$12.04PSLVSprott Physical Silver Trust$8.92NEMNewmont Corporation$51.00WPMWheaton Precious Metals$52.15MAGMAG Silver$14.06ASMAvino Silver &amp; Gold Mines$0.99InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsiShares Silver Trust (SLV)Macro of silverSource: Phawat / Shutterstock.comAlthough investing in silver presents an attractive proposition at this juncture, the white metal historically presented a volatile picture. Therefore, those wanting exposure to the critical asset but also seeking risk mitigation should consider iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA:SLV). An investment that seeks to generally reflect the performance of the silver spot price, SLV offers convenience.Sure, you can always go to your local coin dealer and buy physical silver bullion. However, one of the basic issues with this common approach to investing in silver centers on security. Unless you have an insurance policy that specifically covers physical bullion, losing your holdings to theft (or other unforeseen incidents) could be devastating. With SLV, you’re largely dealing with market risk.Now, that’s not to say that the iShares Silver Trust represents the perfect mechanism for investing in silver. As U.S. News &amp; World Report notes in its overview for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the expense ratio for SLV is 0.5%. That’s rather elevated compared to the category average of 0.65%.Story continuesStill, if you’re looking for an easy, convenient and high-volume means to trade silver, SLV is awfully attractive.ETFMG Prime Junior Silver Miners ETF (SILJ)One bar of silver has been pulled out from a larger pile.Source: ShutterstockAs stated above, one of the risks regarding investing in silver focuses on significant volatility. With silver being a precious metal that features highly for industrial and monetary demand, the white metal tends to move with greater gusto than its cousin gold. However, some speculators appreciate this added mobility. For this crowd, the ETFMG Prime Junior Silver Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:SILJ) may be appropriate.As the name suggests, the SILJ ETF focuses on junior silver-mining enterprises. Unlike their established blue-chip counterparts, junior miners present an aspirational profile. Typically, they’ll conduct operations on promising precious metal projects. However, the chances of finding anything of economic value may be minimal. Therefore, the juniors represent a high-risk, high-reward mechanism for investing in silver.What SILJ offers is the potential ability to mitigate some downside risk. As an ETF, SILJ enjoys a broad canvas. Therefore, a few enterprises may be able to lift the entire fund higher. However, if SILJ carries too many clunkers, the entire investment could go bad.Ultimately, it’s your call. However, if you’re looking to roll the dice, SILJ may be one of best ways for investing in silver.Sprott Physical Silver Trust (PSLV)two silver barsSource: ShutterstockAnother asset to consider for those interested in investing in silver is Sprott Physical Silver Trust (NYSEARCA:PSLV). Taking its name from Eric Sprott, an early champion of precious metals investing, PSLV garners intense interest among silver bugs. We’re talking about ardent silver investors that forward memes advocating for the ownership of real silver, not fake “paper” silver.Here’s the deal. I suppose you can make the argument that buying silver-tethered paper assets represents certificates or promises. As we know from the latest geopolitical conflict, promises don’t mean much if the other party doesn’t want to make good on their word. However, silver bullion is incredibly heavy. You think you’re so cool buying 100-ounce silver bricks preparing for Armageddon until you realize these things are cumbersome.Plus, they’re exhausting to haul around when wearing a gas mask – you preppers know what I’m talking about. So, buying units of the PSLV may be the next best thing to the real deal.Newmont (NEM)Source: ©iStock.com/joebelangerWhile the idea of investing in silver implies specifically focusing on the white metal, in reality, few mining enterprises have such a narrow view of their operations. That’s because in perhaps most mining projects, silver represents a byproduct of copper, lead and zinc extractions. Therefore, it’s worth considering big blue chips like Newmont (NYSE:NEM).To be sure, you’re probably not going to accrue outstanding gains from NEM over the long run. For example, since the start of the year, NEM barely moved up above parity. With such a lackluster performance, it’s tempting to consider other means of investing in silver.At the same time, with such a volatile asset category, it’s good to have some boring names in your portfolio. While Newmont probably won’t make you rich, it should help you stay in the game, so long as the underlying precious metals are cooperative.Also, Wall Street analysts appreciate NEM, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $56.53, implying nearly 14% upside potential.Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)Source: ©iStock.com/hemeroskopionTypically, when it comes to discussions about investing in silver, interested market participants learn about two basic approaches: buying physical silver coins and bars or acquiring shares of silver mining firms. However, within the latter category sits an intriguing subsegment called streaming companies. No, we’re not talking about Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) but rather Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM).In this case, Wheaton doesn’t conduct mining operations. Instead, it makes an agreement with mining enterprises to purchase all or part of the produced precious metals. In return, the miners receive upfront capital. Further, both parties agree to the terms, thus allowing streaming companies greater price predictability. For those leery of wild volatility, streaming enterprises could be a very smart way of investing in silver.Indeed, WPM already benefitted handsomely from the advantages associated with the streaming business model. Since the beginning of this year, shares soared over 25%. Because of this momentum, it’s making up for the troubles of 2022. Thus, it’s a worthy idea for investors to consider.MAG Silver (MAG)silver coinsSource: iStockphotoFor the final two ideas on investing in silver, I’m going to dedicate the space to what you’re really here for: wild, unadulterated speculation. If that wasn’t what you’re seeking, you may wish to turn away now. For everyone else, MAG Silver (NYSEAMERICAN:MAG) may be enticing enough to convince onlookers to roll the dice. Based in western Canada, MAG bills itself as an emerging Tier 1 silver producer.Because it’s a risky enterprise, MAG suffered a nearly 12% loss on a year-to-date basis. However, in the past 30 days, it’s been flying, gaining 20% of equity value. Should the fear trade that’s undergirding gold expand in magnitude, MAG may be able to steal off some momentum.To be fair, though, the underlying enterprise presents a challenging framework. While it enjoys a decently solid balance sheet, it’s also a pre-revenue company. Therefore, you must trust that management knows what it’s doing. That said, analysts peg MAG as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $17.90, implying 28% upside potential.Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines (ASM)Gold and silver bars in front of a grey background.Source: VladKK / ShutterstockAt time of writing, shares of Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines (NYSEAMERICAN:ASM) trade hands at just under a buck. Therefore, ASM is a penny stock – the literal kind. Understandably, this profile won’t be appropriate for all market participants. However, if you’re investing in silver for the chance to strike it rich, Avino could be intriguing.Primarily, you’re looking at significant mobility in the charts. Since the January opener, ASM gained 36% of equity value. Interestingly, in the past 365 days, ASM poked its head above water to the tune of half-a-percent. Therefore, it largely made up for the terrible backdrop that was 2022.Financially, Avino presents a curious narrative. In particular, the company benefits from a decently stable balance sheet. Also, on a trailing-year basis, Avino’s profit margins rank among the industry’s top half. Finally, ASM trades at 1.15-times book value, which is noticeably undervalued.Finally, analysts peg ASM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $1.58, implying nearly 64% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(CVE:AGX) shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 35% after a shaky period beforehand. Looking back a bit further, it's encouraging to see the stock is up 29% in the last year.Following the firm bounce in price, when almost half of the companies in Canada's Metals and Mining industry have price-to-sales ratios (or ""P/S"") below 2.8x, you may consider Silver X Mining as a stock probably not worth researching with its 3.6x P/S ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/S. Check out our latest analysis for Silver X Mining ps-multiple-vs-industryHow Silver X Mining Has Been PerformingSilver X Mining certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing revenue more than most other companies. The P/S is probably high because investors think this strong revenue performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.Keen to find out how analysts think Silver X Mining's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Revenue Growth Forecasted For Silver X Mining?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as high as Silver X Mining's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the industry.If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 181%. Although, its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong with three-year revenue growth being relatively non-existent overall. Therefore, it's fair to say that revenue growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next year should generate growth of 152% as estimated by the one analyst watching the company. With the industry only predicted to deliver 15%, the company is positioned for a stronger revenue result.With this in mind, it's not hard to understand why Silver X Mining's P/S is high relative to its industry peers. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesThe Final WordThe large bounce in Silver X Mining's shares has lifted the company's P/S handsomely. We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.We've established that Silver X Mining maintains its high P/S on the strength of its forecasted revenue growth being higher than the the rest of the Metals and Mining industry, as expected. It appears that shareholders are confident in the company's future revenues, which is propping up the P/S. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Silver X Mining (1 is potentially serious!) that you need to be mindful of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Silver X Mining, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

(TSE:ASM) shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 26% after a shaky period beforehand. Notwithstanding the latest gain, the annual share price return of 4.1% isn't as impressive.Since its price has surged higher, given close to half the companies in Canada have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 10x, you may consider Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines as a stock to avoid entirely with its 36.6x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines has been relatively sluggish. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines pe-multiple-vs-industryKeen to find out how analysts think Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that there was hardly any earnings per share growth to speak of for the company over the past year. Likewise, not much has changed from three years ago as earnings have been stuck during that whole time. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has definitely eluded the company recently.Turning to the outlook, the next year should generate growth of 169% as estimated by the four analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 7.0%, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines' P/E?Shares in Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines have built up some good momentum lately, which has really inflated its P/E. It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.We've established that Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines that you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

Unfortunately, the gains of the last month did little to right the losses of the last year with the stock still down 46% over that time.Although its price has surged higher, Americas Gold and Silver may still be sending buy signals at present with its price-to-sales (or ""P/S"") ratio of 1.4x, considering almost half of all companies in the Metals and Mining industry in Canada have P/S ratios greater than 2.8x and even P/S higher than 22x aren't out of the ordinary. However, the P/S might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified. Check out our latest analysis for Americas Gold and Silver ps-multiple-vs-industryHow Americas Gold and Silver Has Been PerformingAmericas Gold and Silver certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing revenue more than most other companies. Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to dive, which has kept the P/S suppressed. If the company manages to stay the course, then investors should be rewarded with a share price that matches its revenue figures.Keen to find out how analysts think Americas Gold and Silver's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Do Revenue Forecasts Match The Low P/S Ratio?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as low as Americas Gold and Silver's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the industry.If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 89%. Pleasingly, revenue has also lifted 46% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the five analysts covering the company suggest revenue should grow by 20% per year over the next three years. With the industry only predicted to deliver 12% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger revenue result.Story continuesIn light of this, it's peculiar that Americas Gold and Silver's P/S sits below the majority of other companies. It looks like most investors are not convinced at all that the company can achieve future growth expectations.What Does Americas Gold and Silver's P/S Mean For Investors?The latest share price surge wasn't enough to lift Americas Gold and Silver's P/S close to the industry median. It's argued the price-to-sales ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.To us, it seems Americas Gold and Silver currently trades on a significantly depressed P/S given its forecasted revenue growth is higher than the rest of its industry. When we see strong growth forecasts like this, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing significant pressure on the P/S ratio. It appears the market could be anticipating revenue instability, because these conditions should normally provide a boost to the share price.It is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for Americas Gold and Silver (1 is concerning!) that you need to take into consideration.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Americas Gold and Silver, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

The US benchmark failed to break through its 200-day moving average last week and has been trading lower ever since.“Prices need a breath from the latest four-week rally,” said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial Securities.

The expansion marks the first-ever comprehensive pricing offering of the battery recycling supply chain for both Europe and China, complementing Platts' pre-existing, well-established suite of daily battery metals assessments.S&amp;P Global Inc. logoPlatts has observed growing interest in black mass recycling, which will play an integral role in future battery metals supply. Battery production offcuts or used batteries at end-of-life are collected, dismantled and shredded to produce black mass, from which critical materials including lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese can be extracted. The recycling of black mass has become increasingly important as a supplement to virgin material supply, as well as reducing the carbon footprint of the battery supply chain. For Europe, the new Platts Black Mass price assessments ex works (EXW) are the first of kind and the Platts Black Mass price assessments delivered duty paid (DDP) China are among the first aimed at domestic China, all of which will bring greater insight to pricing for battery raw materials, so key to electrification of vehicles worldwide.Scott Yarham, Global Lead of Battery Metals, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said: ""These new Platts Black Mass price assessments will promote understanding and help shed light on value, pricing behavior and trade flows in what has long been an incredibly opaque and non-standardized marketplace.""Anna Crowley, Global Head of Metals Pricing, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said:""The new offering is aimed at meeting market participants' growing needs for full-life-cycle battery metals information and additional supply chain insights.""Story continuesWith sustainability and energy transition a growing focus globally, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights expects recycled battery materials to make up a rapidly increasing share of the battery material supply chain well beyond 2030. The potential availability of recycled materials would account for 30% of nickel, 27% of lithium, and 40% of cobalt demand between 2020 and 2050. Battery recycling has the potential to be cheaper than its virgin material equivalents; create material supply in regions that do not have natural resources available, and be far less carbon intensive.Following extensive market research, Platts is focusing its initial Black Mass assessments and calculations on two types of black mass that make up the majority of material available to the market: lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and nickel-cobalt (Ni-Co)-containing material, which include both battery production scrap and spent lithium-ion batteries:The new LFP assessments reflect the spot market value of a single percentage point of lithium contained within the LFP black mass, Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) China. Platts understands that typical lithium contained in China-delivered LFP is 3.8%.The Ni-Co black mass assessments are published on a DDP China and Ex Works (EXW) Europe basis. The assessments reflect the percentage value, or payable, of black mass constituents lithium, cobalt and nickel, based on the minimum quality specifications of each key component.Platts has also launched two calculated theoretical Ni-Co black mass prices, a DDP China price in Yuan/mt at 1630 Singapore time and an EXW Europe price in USD/mt at 1630 London time.Access details of Platts' price assessments methodology and data prioritization here.The assessments may be found in S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights products and services, including: Platts Nonferrous Metals Alert pages, Platts Metals Daily, Platts Dimensions Pro, Platts Market Center, and in the Platts price database. The assessments are featured on pages MTL8888 and PMA8888 alongside Platts' full suite of battery metals assessments.Media Contacts: Global/EMEA: Paul Sandell, +44 7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.com Americas: Kathleen Tanzy, + 1917 331 4607, kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.comAsia: Melissa Tan, + 65 68189 7569, melissa.tan@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsAt S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodity markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value. We are a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Financial Services Stocks To Invest In Right Now.Strategist Makes The Case For Buying The Dip In FinancialsOn April 5 BMO Capital's Chief Investment Strategist, Brian Belski, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he made the case for investing in financial services stocks and also talked about his outlook for the second half of 2023. Belski thinks that investors should ""take two steps back"" and take an analytical, logical, and long-term approach right now. According to Belski, the market has devalued financial stocks and he thinks that there are three things that this may lead to. Firstly, Belski thinks that the opposite of what happened in the aftermath of the global financial crisis will happen right now. Back then, small and medium banks were among the best performers and large banks took a tumble. Belski thinks that large banks and Canadian banks ""will be the winners"" since they have strong balance sheets and the stability that investors want right now. Secondly, Belksi expects increased M&amp;A activity for small and medium-sized banks, given the issues the are currently dealing with. Finally, Belksi noted that he thinks there is going to be ""pointed regulation"" towards the small and medium-sized banks. Here are some comments from Brian Belski:""From a fundamental perspective, tier-1 capital ratios are 400 basis points above where we were in the great financial crisis. Loan-to-deposit ratios are very steady. Held-to-maturity securities are very pointed in those banks that were the ""bad behavior"" banks. We're seeing no systemic risk. But the financials, at 14% of the market, we believe would be a Strong Overweight here and propose a great value at these levels. You don't have to own them all, you have to be very select. And from our work with rising dispersion and rising earnings growth dispersion across the market, especially on a sector level, you absolutely positively have to be a stock picker.""Story continuesBrian Belski said ""stocks lead earnings, which lead the economy"" and if the economy shows signs of weakness, the Fed will stop its hiking cycle and start cutting interest rates. Belski thinks that the market will be relatively choppy in the first half of the year, but he expects things to pick up and the market to rally in the second half of 2022.As noted by Brian Belski, financials are currently trading at attractive valuations. However, the current market environment requires investors to be a ""stock picker"" and so, we have compiled a list of the best financial services stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. Looking at where institutional investors are placing their bets can help investors determine what may work as we head into the back half of the year. Some of the best financial services stocks to buy now according to hedge funds include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below.10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Invest In Right NowPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe scanned for financial services companies in Insider Monkey's database of 943 elite money managers. We narrowed down our selection to financial services stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Along with each stock, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment, analyst ratings, and top shareholders as well. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Invest In Right Now10. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) was spotted on 74 investors' portfolios that disclosed positions worth $8.1 billion in the company. Of those, GQG Partners was the top investor in the company and held a position worth $1.4 billion.This March, Citi analyst Christopher Allen updated his price target on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) to $65 from $75 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The stock is one of the best financial services stocks to invest in right now according to hedge funds.On March 29, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) disclosed that Marianne Brown, one of the company's directors, purchased $0.26 million worth of the company's common shares.LVS Advisory made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We exited The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) during the week leading up to the Silicon Valley Bank failure at a price in the high $60s. I sent an ad hoc note to partners on March 11 discussing our decision to sell the stock but I will add some additional context here. We invested in Charles Schwab during the summer of 2022 (discussed in our Q3 2022 letter) shortly after making our investment in Interactive Brokers. While Interactive Brokers is focused on faster-growing international markets and more sophisticated traders, Charles Schwab is a more mature US business focused on retirement accounts and wealth managers. Our investment thesis was that Schwab would benefit from higher interest rates and after years of investment would begin returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders.My view changed when it became clear that liquidity would become a greater issue for all banks in early March. We believe Schwab has enough liquidity to operate its business, but we no longer believe the company is in a position to return capital. Furthermore, Schwab saw a higher degree of deposit flight in Q4 than we expected leading us to believe the problem could get worse before it gets better. Schwab may even need to raise additional equity capital to reassure the market of its liquidity position which would drastically change the risk/reward calculation of investing in the stock. While we realized a ~6% loss on our investment, our ability to quickly recalibrate our views during the early stages of the March banking crisis prevented us from losing an additional 20%+ if we had held on until today.”9. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81This April, Barclays updated its price target on Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) to $59 from $61 and reiterated an Equal Weight rating on the shares. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is one of the best financial services stocks to invest in right now, according to hedge funds.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) reported strong earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, on April 14. The company's revenue amounted to $21.45 billion, up 11.78% year over year, and outperformed revenue consensus by $1.39 billion. The company's EPS for the quarter amounted to $2.19 and beat EPS estimates by $0.50.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was a part of 81 hedge funds' portfolios that held positions worth $7.4 billion in the company. Of those, Berkshire Hathaway was the leading investor in the company and disclosed a position worth $2.49 billion.In addition to Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), hedge funds are also bullish on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).8. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87On April 14, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) announced market-beating earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported an EPS of $1.23 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.09. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $20.73 billion, up 17.83% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $669.31 million. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is placed eighth on our list of the best financial services stocks to buy now.This April, Raymond James analyst David Long upgraded Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) to Strong Buy from Outperform and revised his price target on the shares to $47 from $52.At the end of Q4 2022, 87 hedge funds were long Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) and held collective stakes worth $5.5 billion in the company. Of those, Eagle Capital Management was the dominant shareholder and held a position worth $1.1 billion.Davis Advisors made the following comment about Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“Our investment thesis for our next largest bank investment, Wells Fargo, is totally different. As is well known, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is the country’s third-largest bank, serving one in three U.S. households. Years of regulatory missteps under prior managements resulted in reputational damage, higher-than-average expenses, numerous consent orders, caps on asset growth, all added to the negative impact of low rates on their interest income. However, where others see bad news, we see resiliency and gradual improvement. Wells Fargo’s resiliency is reflected in the fact that despite years of terrible headlines and congressional hearings, Wells Fargo’s core customers stayed put and customer attrition remains extraordinarily low.As to gradual improvement, new management has made steady headway in closing consent orders, settling regulatory matters and upgrading systems. Thus, rather than increasing profits from growth, Wells Fargo’s earnings growth for the next three-to-five years should come from the combined tailwinds of rising interest income, partially offset by normalizing credit costs, reduced expenses as systems improve and the scandals of the last decade are gradually put behind them, and the return of excess capital through share repurchases and rising dividends. The hypothetical earnings bridge displayed in Figure 6 gives some sense of the earnings power we see unfolding in the years ahead for this durable financial franchise.While our grounded optimism carries the day, we are mindful of the risk that Wells Fargo’s historically excellent credit culture may have deteriorated, or that exasperated regulators may choose to extract even more major penalties for past infractions.”7. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Wall Street sees material upside to S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) and the stock is one of the best financial services stocks to invest in right now. This February, Argus analyst John Eade raised his price target on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) to $400 from $380 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares.As of April 14, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) has gained roughly 17% over the past 6 months. Moreover, according to the company's balance sheet, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) has a trailing twelve-month FCF of more than $2.5 billion.S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) was held by 97 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2022. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $7.8 billion. As of December 31, TCI Fund Management is the most prominent investor in the company and has a stake worth $3 billion.Baron Funds made the following comment about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) increased 10.1% during the quarter as investors looked past weak debt issuance activity and anticipated a potential issuance rebound in 2023. Equity markets rose during the quarter, offering some reprieve to asset-based revenue headwinds. The company also hosted an Investor Day during which management provided medium-term financial guidance of 7% to 9% annual revenue growth and low to mid-teens annual EPS growth. We continue to own the stock due to the company’s durable growth characteristics that are underpinned by the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while also benefiting from significant competitive advantages.”6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 100At the close of the fourth quarter of 2022, 100 hedge funds disclosed having stakes in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM).

(CVE:AGX) shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 35% after a shaky period beforehand. Looking back a bit further, it's encouraging to see the stock is up 29% in the last year.Following the firm bounce in price, when almost half of the companies in Canada's Metals and Mining industry have price-to-sales ratios (or ""P/S"") below 2.8x, you may consider Silver X Mining as a stock probably not worth researching with its 3.6x P/S ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/S. Check out our latest analysis for Silver X Mining ps-multiple-vs-industryHow Silver X Mining Has Been PerformingSilver X Mining certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing revenue more than most other companies. The P/S is probably high because investors think this strong revenue performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.Keen to find out how analysts think Silver X Mining's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Revenue Growth Forecasted For Silver X Mining?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as high as Silver X Mining's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the industry.If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 181%. Although, its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong with three-year revenue growth being relatively non-existent overall. Therefore, it's fair to say that revenue growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next year should generate growth of 152% as estimated by the one analyst watching the company. With the industry only predicted to deliver 15%, the company is positioned for a stronger revenue result.With this in mind, it's not hard to understand why Silver X Mining's P/S is high relative to its industry peers. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesThe Final WordThe large bounce in Silver X Mining's shares has lifted the company's P/S handsomely. We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.We've established that Silver X Mining maintains its high P/S on the strength of its forecasted revenue growth being higher than the the rest of the Metals and Mining industry, as expected. It appears that shareholders are confident in the company's future revenues, which is propping up the P/S. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Silver X Mining (1 is potentially serious!) that you need to be mindful of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Silver X Mining, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

(TSE:ASM) shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 26% after a shaky period beforehand. Notwithstanding the latest gain, the annual share price return of 4.1% isn't as impressive.Since its price has surged higher, given close to half the companies in Canada have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 10x, you may consider Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines as a stock to avoid entirely with its 36.6x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines has been relatively sluggish. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing.

Likewise, not much has changed from three years ago as earnings have been stuck during that whole time. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has definitely eluded the company recently.Turning to the outlook, the next year should generate growth of 169% as estimated by the four analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 7.0%, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Avino Silver &amp; Gold Mines is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market.

74,52e7669f-662d-3c65-8613-44e5568446de,MA,2023-04-17,Further Upside For Americas Gold and Silver Corporation (TSE:USA) Shares Could Introduce Price Risks After 38% Bounce,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/further-upside-americas-gold-silver-100839633.html,1681726119,STORY,"['SI=F', 'GC=F']","[Americas Gold and Silver Corporation (TSE:USA) shareholders are no doubt pleased to see that the share price has bounced 38% in the last month, although it is still struggling to make up recently lost ground. Unfortunately, the gains of the last month did little to right the losses of the last year with the stock still down 46% over that time.Although its price has surged higher, Americas Gold and Silver may still be sending buy signals at present with its price-to-sales (or ""P/S"") ratio of 1.4x, considering almost half of all companies in the Metals and Mining industry in Canada have P/S ratios greater than 2.8x and even P/S higher than 22x aren't out of the ordinary. However, the P/S might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified. Check out our latest analysis for Americas Gold and Silver ps-multiple-vs-industryHow Americas Gold and Silver Has Been PerformingAmericas Gold and Silver certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing revenue more than most other companies. Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to dive, which has kept the P/S suppressed. If the company manages to stay the course, then investors should be rewarded with a share price that matches its revenue figures.Keen to find out how analysts think Americas Gold and Silver's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Do Revenue Forecasts Match The Low P/S Ratio?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as low as Americas Gold and Silver's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the industry.If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 89%. Pleasingly, revenue has also lifted 46% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the five analysts covering the company suggest revenue should grow by 20% per year over the next three years. With the industry only predicted to deliver 12% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger revenue result.Story continuesIn light of this, it's peculiar that Americas Gold and Silver's P/S sits below the majority of other companies. It looks like most investors are not convinced at all that the company can achieve future growth expectations.What Does Americas Gold and Silver's P/S Mean For Investors?The latest share price surge wasn't enough to lift Americas Gold and Silver's P/S close to the industry median. It's argued the price-to-sales ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.To us, it seems Americas Gold and Silver currently trades on a significantly depressed P/S given its forecasted revenue growth is higher than the rest of its industry. When we see strong growth forecasts like this, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing significant pressure on the P/S ratio. It appears the market could be anticipating revenue instability, because these conditions should normally provide a boost to the share price.It is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for Americas Gold and Silver (1 is concerning!) that you need to take into consideration.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Americas Gold and Silver, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

77,18096c17-7368-389f-aa8a-c8aa0f783d64,LMT,2023-04-17,Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) shareholders have earned a 9.6% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-nyse-lmt-shareholders-130017632.html,1681650017,STORY,['LMT'],"[If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 39% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up just 4.3% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Lockheed Martin managed to grow its earnings per share at 28% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Lockheed Martin's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Lockheed Martin, it has a TSR of 58% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Lockheed Martin has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 7.0% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 10% per year, is even more impressive. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Lockheed Martin better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Lockheed Martin is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Lockheed Martin is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

78,e8fbe9e4-5cc7-3478-9494-86d1df8ec1dc,LMT,2023-04-17,7 Stocks That Will Surge in a Recession Scenario,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-surge-recession-scenario-200700815.html,1681416420,STORY,"['COST', 'CVX', 'LMT', 'GOLD', 'PFE', 'RIOT', 'NEM']","[As monetary policies remain tight, there is an increasing fear recession in 2023. While several sectors might be impacted, a recession is not necessarily bad news for all. In fact, there are many sectors where we can still find some of the best stocks for recession.It’s important to understand why investors should not panic in a recession scenario. First, equities discount events in advance and it’s likely that the recession factor is priced in the market. Furthermore, policymakers shift stance in a recession towards expansionary monetary policies. The government, invariably, focuses on stimulus packages. These potential actions are good for the markets as it boosts liquidity in the financial system.I would therefore focus on some of the best stocks for recession that can best index returns in the coming quarters. Most of the stocks discussed are low-beta stocks and ensure capital preservation and regular cash flow through dividends. Let’s discuss seven of the best stocks for recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNEMNewmont Corporation$51.05RIOTRiot Platforms$13.47CVXChevron$172.23PFEPfizer$41.54LMTLockheed Martin$491.70COSTCostco$497.94GOLDBarrick Gold$20.10Newmont Corporation (NEM)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockGold is already trending higher and I believe that the positive momentum is likely to sustain in a recession scenario. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is possibly the best proxy exposure to gold. The gold miner has an investment grade balance sheet and strong cash flow visibility.Newmont closed 2022 with a total liquidity buffer of $6.7 billion. For the period, the company’s net-debt-to-adjusted- EBITDA was 0.5x. The company also reported a healthy operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for 2022.With gold trading above $2,000 an ounce, the operating cash flow is likely to be in excess of $5 billion for the year. This would imply higher investments coupled with increased shareholder rewards. NEM stock currently offers a dividend yield of 3.2% and I expect healthy dividend growth if the rally for gold sustains. Overall, with strong fundamentals, robust cash flows, and an attractive dividend yield, NEM stock is attractive.Story continuesRiot Platforms (RIOT)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockIt’s worth noting that gold and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) have been some of the top performing assets in the first few months of 2023. I believe that Bitcoin will surge higher in a recessionary scenario, backed by a weak dollar. That being said, BTC mining stocks like Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) appear attractive.A strong balance sheet is a key reason to like Riot Platforms. The company ended 2022 with zero debt and $230 million in cash. Further, Riot holds 7,058 Bitcoin in its balance sheet. High financial flexibility will support aggressive growth plans.Riot has already been boosting mining capacity and expects capacity of 12.5EH/s by the second half of 2023. Last year, the company reported Bitcoin mining gross margin of 60.3%. Being a low-cost producer is another advantage for Riot. For the current year, healthy cash flows can be expected if Bitcoin remains in an uptrend.Chevron (CVX)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comIt’s interesting to note that oil has recovered quickly from 2023 lows of $65. There are two reasons for this sharp recovery. First, OPEC and its allies recently cut production to ensure that price is supported at higher levels. Further, the recession factor is discounted in the price and a potentially weak dollar will be positive for energy prices.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock has trended higher by 7% in the last six months. This is amidst volatility in oil price. I expect CVX to breakout on the upside in a recession scenario. Besides the weak dollar factor, investors will look for an investment grade balance sheet and healthy dividends. CVX stock is fundamentally strong and offers a dividend yield of 3.57%.It’s also worth noting that Chevron reported operating cash flow of $47.5 billion in 2022. With low break-even assets, OCF will remain strong even if oil is in the range of $80 to $90 per barrel. This will ensure sustained dividends and continued share repurchase.Pfizer (PFE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7In general, investors look for defensive low-beta stocks in a recession scenario. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), for example, is among the best in this segment and looks undervalued. PFE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.3 and offers a dividend yield of 3.9%.As funds flow into safe stocks with an attractive yield, PFE stock is likely to trend higher. Of course, the pharmaceutical sector is relatively immune to economic shocks.In terms of business development, there are two points to note. First, Pfizer has a deep pipeline of 110 drug candidates. The late-stage pipeline is attractive and will ensure steady revenue growth.Furthermore, Pfizer has witnessed significant cash inflow from the sale of covid-19 vaccines. The company is utilizing the improved financial flexibility for acquisition driven growth. The company expects to add $25 billion in incremental revenue from business development deals by 2030. Therefore, the overall outlook for Pfizer is optimistic and I would remain invested at current valuations.Lockheed Martin (LMT)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) also has a low-beta and offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.46%. With a forward P/E of 18, LMT stock looks undervalued and can trend higher as investors flee to safer stocks with an investment grade balance sheet.It’s worth noting that Lockheed has been benefiting as geopolitical tensions escalate. My point is underscored by the fact that the company’s order backlog has swelled to $150 billion as of Q4 2022. On a year-on-year basis, Lockheed reported a 11% growth in backlog.A healthy backlog provides clear cash flow visibility for the year and 2024. Last year, Lockheed reported free cash flow of $6.1 billion. Even if FCF remains stable at these levels, there is ample headroom for value creation.From a growth perspective, Lockheed has been investing in new technology like hypersonics. Further, orders from Europe are likely to improve in the coming years. LMT stock would therefore remain attractive even after an economic recovery.Costco Wholesale (COST)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) declined by 15% over the last 12 months. This does not come as a surprise with the retail sector being impacted by inflation. However, in a recession scenario, I expect a breakout to the upside for the stock.It’s important to note that the U.S. economy is consumption driven with retail spending being a key component. To pull the economy out of recession, policymakers are likely to focus on boosting consumption spending. This will benefit retailers in a recession scenario.I must also mention that Costco has been reporting decent numbers amidst challenges for the sector. For Q3 2023, the company reported 6.5% growth in revenue on a year-on-year basis to $54.24 billion. Potentially lower interest rates in the second half of 2023 or in 2024 will benefit Costco.I like the fact that Costco generates $4.3 billion in membership fee annually. With a high renewal rate and warehouse expansion, growth in recurring revenue will support cash flows.Barrick Gold (GOLD)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comBarrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) is another gold mining stock that I would buy and hold in a recession scenario. GOLD stock has edged higher marginally by 10% for year-to-date 2022. I believe that the best part of the rally for the stock is due in the coming quarters.Barrick Gold has an investment grade balance sheet and high cash flow potential. The company ended 2022 with a cash buffer of $4.4 billion. Further, operating cash flows for the year were $3.5 billion. At current gold price, it’s likely that OCF will be exceeding $5 billion. This would imply healthy dividend growth.The company is also attractive considering the asset base. Barrick ended 2022 with 76 million ounces in gold reserves. With strong financial flexibility, the company has clear cash flow visibility in the coming years.I must also mention that the company has guided for an all-in-sustaining-cost of less than $1,200 an ounce. Assuming a scenario where gold is in a long-term uptrend, EBITDA margin expansion will be significant.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(Nasdaq:MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, and Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced the first presentation of detailed results from the Phase 2b KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial evaluating mRNA-4157 (V940), an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy (INT), in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with resected high-risk melanoma (stage III/IV). In the overall intention-to-treat population, adjuvant treatment with mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in recurrence-free survival (RFS), and reduced the risk of recurrence or death by 44% (HR=0.56 [95% CI, 0.309-1.017]; one-sided p value=0.0266) compared with KEYTRUDA alone.These findings will be presented during the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2023 plenary session and press conference (Abstract #CT001). Data from a subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (Abstract #CT224) evaluating mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA among patients based on tumor mutational burden (TMB) status will also be presented.""Today's results provide further encouragement for the potential of mRNA as an individualized neoantigen therapy to positively impact patients with high-risk resected melanoma,"" said Dr. Kyle Holen, M.D. Moderna's Senior Vice President and Head of Development, Therapeutics and Oncology.

""These data support the potential of mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA to help fight melanoma earlier and warrant investigation of the combination in a larger Phase 3 trial. We also look forward to studying mRNA-4157 (V940) and KEYTRUDA in a variety of other early-stage cancers.""Based on data from KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and the PRIME scheme, respectively, for mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with high-risk melanoma following complete resection. Additional data from KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed publication. The companies previously announced positive data from this study in December 2022.Additional efficacy and safety data from KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (Abstract #CT001)In KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201, 107 patients received mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA and 50 patients were treated with KEYTRUDA alone. Recurrence or death was reported in 22.4% of patients (n=24/107) in the combination arm compared with 40% of patients (n=20/50) who received KEYTRUDA alone with a median follow-up of 23 and 24 months, respectively. The 12-month RFS rate was 83.4% (95% CI, 74.7-89.3) and 77.1% (95% CI, 62.5-86.6) in the combination and control arms, respectively. The 18-month RFS rate was 78.6% (95% CI, 69.0-85.6) and 62.2% (95% CI, 46.9-74.3) in the combination and control arms, respectively.Adverse events reported with mRNA-4157 (V940) in KEYNOTE-942 were consistent with those previously observed in a Phase 1 clinical trial. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA was consistent with findings from previous studies. The number of patients reporting treatment related Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were similar between the arms (25% vs 18%, respectively). The most common adverse events of any grade attributed to either mRNA-4157 (V940) or the combination of mRNA-4157 (V940) and KEYTRUDA were fatigue (60.6%), injection site pain (55.8%) and chills (50.0%).TMB subgroup analysis from KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (#CT224)Data from an exploratory subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 showed that improvement in RFS was observed with mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA compared to KEYTRUDA alone regardless of TMB status. TMB was assessed using tumor biopsies analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole transcriptome sequencing. According to the established WES genomic score for KEYTRUDA, TMB high was defined as ≥10 mut/Mb (175 mut/exome) assessed using the FoundationOne CDx assay.The RFS benefit of mRNA-4157 (V940) in combination with KEYTRUDA compared to KEYTRUDA alone observed in the intention-to-treat population was maintained across both TMB high (HR=0.65; 95% CI: 0.284-1.494) and TMB non-high (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.243-1.425) subpopulations. The association between TMB and mRNA-4157 (V940) treatment effect will be further explored in upcoming planned studies.About mRNA-4157 (V940)mRNA-4157 (V940) is a novel investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based individualized neoantigen therapy1 consisting of a single synthetic mRNA coding for up to 34 neoantigens that is designed and produced based on the unique mutational signature of the DNA sequence of the patient's tumor. Upon administration into the body, the algorithmically derived and RNA-encoded neoantigen sequences are endogenously translated and undergo natural cellular antigen processing and presentation, a key step in adaptive immunity.Individualized neoantigen therapies are designed to prime the immune system so that a patient can generate a tailored antitumor response specific to their tumor mutation signature. mRNA-4157 (V940) is designed to stimulate an immune response by generating specific T cell responses based on the unique mutational signature of a patient's tumor. KEYTRUDA is an immunotherapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Based on early clinical studies, combining mRNA-4157 (V940) with KEYTRUDA may potentially provide an additive benefit and enhance T cell-mediated destruction of tumor cells.About KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (NCT03897881)KEYNOTE-942 is an ongoing randomized, open-label Phase 2b trial that enrolled 157 patients with high-risk stage III/IV melanoma. Following complete surgical resection, patients were randomized 2:1 (stratified by stage) to receive mRNA-4157 (V940) (1 mg every three weeks for nine doses) and KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks up to 18 cycles [for approximately one year]) versus KEYTRUDA alone for approximately one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is RFS, defined as the time from first dose of KEYTRUDA until the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), a new primary melanoma, or death from any cause in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints include distant metastasis-free survival and safety, and exploratory endpoints include distribution of TMB expression in baseline tumor samples across study arms and their association with the primary RFS endpoint.Key eligibility criteria for the trial included: patients with resectable cutaneous melanoma metastatic to a lymph node and at high risk of recurrence, patients with complete resection within 13 weeks prior to the first dose of KEYTRUDA, patients were disease free at study entry (after surgery) with no loco-regional relapse or distant metastasis and no clinical evidence of brain metastases, patients had a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample available suitable for sequencing, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1 and patients with normal organ and marrow function reported at screening.About MelanomaMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades, with nearly 325,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020. In the U.S., skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed, and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. It is estimated there will be nearly 100,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and almost 8,000 deaths resulting from the disease in the U.S. in 2022. The five-year survival rates are estimated to be 60.3% for stage III and 16.2% for stage IV.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry's largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. In adult patients who received adjuvant therapy for NSCLC, patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal DysfunctionKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular:Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal:Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

90,2117069c-8574-3623-8391-63f637ab4906,MOS,2023-04-17,10 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-fertilizer-stocks-buy-105310810.html,1681728790,STORY,"['NTR', 'ADM', 'SMG', 'FMC', 'MOS', 'UAN']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best fertilizer stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.In 2022, global fertilizer prices had hiked to near-record levels, which spelled trouble for crop production in 2022 and even in 2023. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the limited and expensive supply of fertilizers was damaged further, resulting in shortage concerns through 2022 and well into 2023 as well. Such concerns are unsubstantiated, considering the fact that Russia is the world's largest supplier of fertilizers. The country accounts for about 45% of the global ammonia nitrate market and 18% of the potash market, for instance. As a result, the global community is heavily reliant on Russian fertilizer products, a reliance they are attempting to let go of in light of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.Fertilizer Market Situation in 2023According to the United States Foreign Agricultural Service, the US was able to avoid the surge in fertilizer prices in the aftermath of the Russian invasion because it had purchased most of its fertilizers from the country in 2021. However, this was expected to provide only temporary relief since the conflict is still ongoing. Despite this bleak outlook, the situation today has moderately improved. According to the World Bank's Food Security Update from March 23, fertilizer prices fell from their 2022 peaks this March because of shifting supplies and trade linkages. Countries that had been heavily reliant on Russia before the invasion of Ukraine managed to find alternative sources for their fertilizer imports. For example, Brazil began increasing its potash imports from Canada, while Morocco began sourcing ammonia from Egypt and Saudi Arabia.The US is also taking steps to increase American-made fertilizer production in 2023. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $29 million grant offer in March, which was focused on projects aimed at increasing American fertilizer production. Such a move is bound to bring American fertilizer companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) on par with Canadian fertilizer companies like Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), which are benefitting from increased supply demands. This grant is the first in an expected series of grants from the $3 billion fund the USDA currently holds for the promotion of innovative domestic fertilizer production capacity.Story continuesImpact of US Grants on American Fertilizer CompaniesSeveral examples of American fertilizer producers demonstrate how the above-mentioned grants are already beginning to help US-based companies. Pursell Agri-Tech LLC, a manufacturer of controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) based in Alabama, has been offered $4.9 million to assist the company with working capital and to increase its inventory by 40,000 tons per year. Palindromes Inc., based in Missouri, has also been offered $4.9 million to expand its use of anaerobic digestion and renewable energy in the production, processing, and sale of climate-smart fertilizer. Finally, Perfect Blend LLC, based in Washington, has been offered $2.6 million to help the company expand its manufacturing and processing of raw manure and fish waste into fertilizer by using the company's patented technology. The examples of these companies show the on-ground impact of the US government's steps to increase domestic fertilizer production at a time when the fertilizer market is vulnerable.These steps, which the US government began taking in September 2022, have already begun to make a difference in the American fertilizer market. In light of these developments, we have compiled a list of the best fertilizer stocks to buy today according to hedge fund sentiment.Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainLet's now take a look at the 10 best fertilizer stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Our MethodologyFor our list below, we have selected fertilizer stocks, including nitrogen fertilizer producers and agricultural technology companies that are transforming the use of fertilizers today. These stocks are highly popular among hedge funds today, according to Insider Monkey's fourth-quarter hedge fund data when 943 hedge funds were tracked. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest. They also have positive analyst ratings.Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds10. CVR Partners LP (NYSE:UAN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 5CVR Partners LP (NYSE:UAN) produces and sells nitrogen fertilizer products in the US. It is based in Sugar Land, Texas.In the fourth quarter, CVR Partners LP (NYSE:UAN) reported net sales of $836 million compared to $533 million in 2022. This represents a year-over-year increase of 57%. The company's operating cash flow has risen over the past two years. For example, in 2022 CVR Partners LP (NYSE:UAN) had an operating cash flow of $301 million, which was 10 times higher than the figure in 2018.Citadel Investment Group was the largest shareholder in CVR Partners LP (NYSE:UAN) at the end of the fourth quarter, holding 68,400 shares in the company. In total, five hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $11.3 million.CVR Partners LP (NYSE:UAN), like Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), and Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), is an exceptional fertilizer company that is popular among hedge funds today.9. The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) manufactures, markets, and sells products in the fertilizers and agricultural chemicals sector. It is based in Marysville, Ohio.Gaurav Jain, an analyst at Barclays, holds an Overweight rating on The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG)  shares as of February 21.The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) is among the largest global marketers of branded lawn and garden care products, with brands such as Scotts, Miracle-Gro, and Ortho falling under its wing. The company has immense growth potential, with company management expecting a free cash flow of $1 billion over the next two years.Our hedge fund data for the fourth quarter shows 27 funds long The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG). Their total stake value was $153 million.Madison Funds, managed by Madison Investment Management, mentioned The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Stock selection was the poorest for us in this sector. Two stocks in particular – Hain Celestial (HAIN) and The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) – while big winners for us in 2020 and 2021, hurt the portfolio in 2022.While both companies were so-called COVID beneficiaries (businesses that benefited from consumers staying home and spending on their homes during COVID), we felt they possessed certain additional drivers that would maintain their fundamentals into 2022 and beyond.Scott’s Miracle-Gro is arguably one of the great American franchises. The brand is synonymous with lawn care and pest control, has a dominant market share (~60%) with historically-impressive ~30% cash flow margins, and has the country’s largest Cannabis supply business. Scotts’ core business saw a significant windfall during COVID lockdowns. Lawn and garden care is not a growth business, and SMG dominance does not allow for much incremental gain in market share. However, our thesis was that even in a reopening scenario where lawn and garden businesses would revert to the mean, the cannabis market was poised for years of growth as more states legalized recreational use.What we missed was the highly inefficient structure of the U.S. cannabis market. Currently, California, Colorado, and Michigan have the biggest and most mature markets. However, over the course of the last few years, several very large states and regions have voted to legalize recreational use, including New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The fly in the ointment has been Oklahoma, which is a medical marijuana state. Although recreational use is still prohibited, licenses to grow the crop were granted in Laissez Faire fashion to anyone willing to buy one. Oklahoma began to grow and cultivate the crop far in excess of their medical marijuana demand. That excess supply bled into grey markets across the country, devastating pricing for growers in other states. This glut put a near complete stop to capital spending on grow operations. With no new or incremental facilities coming on, Scotts’ Hawthorne business was cut in half from its peak in F21. This, of course, had a devastating effect on the stock.”8. FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) provides crop protection, plant health, and professional pest and turf management products. The company offers agriculture technology like its Arc™ Farm Intelligence platform and other precision agriculture solutions to ensure better crop protection as well.On March 17, Tony Jones at Redburn upgraded FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) shares from Neutral to Buy.Over 93% of FMC Corporation's (NYSE:FMC) total revenue in 2022 was generated by its chemical products, such as fungicides and herbicides. The company beat its 2021 revenue in 2022 by 15%, while its gross margins increased by 8% between 2021 and 2022.FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) had 33 hedge funds long its stock at the end of the fourth quarter, of which Citadel Investment Group was the largest shareholder, holding 1.04 million shares in the company. The total stake value in the stock was $563 million.TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, mentioned FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Within Materials, FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) is an agricultural sciences company offering solutions in areas such as crop protection, plant health, professional pest, and turf management. The company delivered solid third quarter results that led to a 19% boost to its stock price. Management continues to view the outlook as favorable, underpinning strong demand. Inflationary pressures appear to be easing and supportive of margin expansion.”7. Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) procures, transports, and merchandises agricultural commodities and products such as fertilizers. It is based in Chicago, Illinois.On April 13, analysts at BMO Capital reinstated coverage of Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) shares with an Outperform rating.Shares of Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) have a five-year average forward P/E ratio of 13.6. Compared to this, the stock is trading at a P/E ratio of 11.7 as of April 16, showing that the stock is undervalued at the moment and has the potential to grow. In the fourth quarter, Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) generated revenues of $26.2 billion, representing an increase of 13.6% year-over-year.There were 40 hedge funds long Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in the fourth quarter, with a total stake value of $701 million.6. Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) distributes crop nutrients, crop protection products, and more.

(NYSE:NTR) has a forward P/E ratio of 7.64 as of April 16, which is well below the industry average of 13.7, showing that the stock is also undervalued and hence a steal at the moment.First Eagle Investment Management was the largest shareholder in Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) at the end of the fourth quarter, holding 8.5 million shares. In total, 40 hedge funds were long the stock. Their total stake value was $755 million.ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, mentioned Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“However, we believe this is exactly the kind of environment that separates the highest-quality companies from their peers and allows them to strengthen their competitive positioning. For example, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), a Canadian fertilizer company, was a top contributor during the quarter. While the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia have significantly reduced the output of two of the world’s largest agricultural producers, Nutrien has benefited from a strong global agricultural cycle and from farmers seeking to increase their output and capitalize on higher agricultural prices.”Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), like Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), is a fertilizer stock many elite hedge funds are piling into today. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:9 Best Fertilizer Stocks To Buy Now15 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World11 Best Agriculture Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: None. 10 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

These are the best fitness stocks to buy according to hedge funds.10 Best Fitness and Gym Stocks To Buy NowJacob Lund/Shutterstock.comBest Fitness and Gym Stocks To Buy Now10. Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM) sells fresh, natural, and organic food products within the United States. The company's offerings include various categories of perishable products such as meat, seafood, fresh produce, deli, bakery, dairy and dairy alternatives, as well as non-perishable products such as vitamins and supplements, grocery items, bulk goods, frozen foods, beer and wine, and natural health and body care products. Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM)’s products are often consumed by fitness oriented people. On March 2, Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.42 and a revenue of $1.58 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.05 and $20 million, respectively. JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman on March 8 raised the firm's price target on Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM) to $35 from $33 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares. The company's stock has increased by 44% since May of last year due to ""three surprisingly strong prints"" in a row, marking the first time since pre-pandemic. The analyst credited CEO Jack Sinclair for stabilizing Sprouts' fundamentals. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 18 hedge funds were bullish on Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM), compared to 19 funds in the earlier quarter. D E Shaw held the largest stake in the company, comprising 720,941 shares worth $23.3 million. In addition to NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Peloton Interactive, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON), and Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX), Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM) is one of the best fitness stocks to invest in. Here is what Arch Capital specifically said about Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We entered 2022 with Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM) as the fund’s largest position. This was due to our initial position sizing, the stock’s great performance, and the poor performance of the rest of our portfolio holdings. In early March, SFM popped 15% and reached a market cap close to $4 billion. This put a double whammy on our expected forward returns for the stock. First, and most obvious, ahttps://www.insidermonkey.com/institutional-investor/arch-capital-group-ltd/1988825/ higher market cap means we are yielding less in cash flow each year. Our bet on SFM revolved around durable (but low growth) cash flow generation that was yielding more than 10% when we purchased shares. At a market cap significantly higher, forward returns would be lower than our 15% hurdle rate. Second, a big reason we liked SFM was management’s strategy to pour all free cash flow into share repurchases at a depressed earnings multiple. This attractiveness incrementally goes away at higher and higher share prices. Combine this with other opportunities presenting themselves with the broad market sell-off this year, and we decided to fully exit our SFM position.”9. The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAIN) manufactures, markets, and sells organic and natural products in the United States, United Kingdom, and internationally. It is one of the best fitness stocks to monitor. Following The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAIN)’s fiscal Q2 results, JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman downgraded the company from Overweight to Neutral, with a price target of $21, a reduction from $22. Although the stock has been strong and increased by 38% since its lowest point on December 20, 2022, the analyst revised EBITDA and earnings estimates for fiscal 2024 and 2025. JPMorgan is taking a less aggressive approach towards sales growth assumptions due to recent volatility and predicts that The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAIN) will invest a significant portion of its cost savings in marketing and other growth-driving activities.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 18 hedge funds were bullish on The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAIN), compared to 22 funds in the prior quarter. David Paradice’s Paradice Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.45 million shares worth $23.6 million. Madison Funds made the following comment about The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAIN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection was the poorest for us in this sector. Two stocks in particular – The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAIN) and Scott’s Miracle-Gro (SMG) – while big winners for us in 2020 and 2021, hurt the portfolio in 2022.While both companies were so-called COVID beneficiaries (businesses that benefited from consumers staying home and spending on their homes during COVID), we felt they possessed certain additional drivers that would maintain their fundamentals into 2022 and beyond. Hain, for example, has a strong portfolio of organic health and wellness brands that target a higher-end demographic. As strong as their brands are, there is ample room for growth. Put simply, there are channels of distribution like Costco and Walgreens that their brands don’t currently serve, but we believe eventually will. Furthermore, we believed HAIN’s portfolio had pricing power to pull them through this inflationary period.While we were largely correct on both counts, we underestimated the challenges they faced in their European business (40% of revenue), which overshadowed their success in North America. Entering 2022, HAIN’s stock had just hit a 5-year high of $45. However, the good times were short-lived as Russia invaded Ukraine early in 2022, sending energy prices materially higher in Europe. Although HAIN has a #1 or #2 market share in their brand categories, they could not withstand the economic shock from the war. The pressures on Hain’s European business came from multiple fronts: Rising energy prices skyrocketed their manufacturing and transportation costs. Essential ingredients for their products, like sunflower oil, became scarce as Ukraine is a key exporter of grains. The pressure on energy prices exacerbated an already weakened U.K. consumer due to BREXIT. And finally, the structure of the grocery market in the U.K. led to a delay in price increases. All of these factors weighed heavily on earnings and cash flow. Although we reduced our position size in the early summer, the stock took considerable punishment. As we enter the new year, HAIN’s European business has stabilized considerably. Natural Gas prices have meaningfully corrected, bringing relief not just to their costs but to the U.K. consumer.”8. Garmin Ltd. (NYSE:GRMN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Garmin Ltd. (NYSE:GRMN) creates, designs, produces, promotes, and delivers an array of wireless equipment across various regions including the Americas, Asia Pacific, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

(NYSE:GRMN)’s price target from $97 to $101 while maintaining an Equal Weight rating on the shares. The analyst reported that the company's Q4 revenue and earnings exceeded expectations due to strong performances in its Aviation and Auto segments. However, Garmin Ltd.

(NYSE:GRMN), compared to 26 funds in the preceding quarter. Select Equity Group is the largest stakeholder of the company. 7. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is a footwear and apparel retailer with operations in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and the Middle East. The company has a portfolio of brands that includes Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, and Champs Sports, as well as the WSS and atmos brands. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) sells sneakers and apparel aimed at youth culture, while Kids Foot Locker caters to children, and Champs Sports operates as a specialty retailer for athletic footwear and apparel in shopping malls. It is one of the best fitness stocks to invest in. On March 20, Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 and a revenue of $2.33 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.47 and $190 million, respectively. On April 4, Argus maintained a Hold rating on Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL). The firm acknowledged that Foot Locker has renewed its partnership with Nike after the latter declared last year that it would restrict the supply of its products at Foot Locker stores. Despite this development, Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is still encountering difficulties in rejuvenating its business. Argus predicts that Foot Locker's earnings will continue to be strained in the immediate future, and as a result, they have lowered their FY24 projection from $4.16 to $3.56.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) was part of 25 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 24 funds in the prior quarter. Daniel Kretinsky’s Vesa Equity Investment is the largest stakeholder of the company. Here is what Miller Value Partners Deep Value Strategy has to say about Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: “Finally, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) came under significant pressure during the quarter, with the stock down more than 50% from its highs and valuation not far from early 2020 lows. Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS &amp; Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into the Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices). With the next 12 to 18 months as a transition period for the company, the share price weakness provides attractive reward/risk investment potential, near 3x Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) and close to a 30% normalized free cash flow yield.”6. Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) franchises and manages fitness centers under its eponymous brand. The company has three divisions – Franchise, Corporate-Owned Stores, and Equipment. The Franchise division franchises its business in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Panama, Mexico, and Australia.

The Equipment division sells fitness equipment to franchisee-owned stores in the United States and Canada.On March 16, ABC Fitness Solutions declared that it has entered into a fresh four-year deal with Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT), which is one of the rapidly expanding franchisors and operators of fitness centers, with a higher number of members than any other fitness brand.

(NYSE:PLNT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT), the leading franchiser and operator of low-cost fitness centers, rose after reporting strong results. The company reported system-wide same-store sales increased 8.2%, raised estimates for growth in net income, and authorized another large share repurchase. Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Fitness and Gym Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Best Music Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy11 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks to Buy According to Analysts Disclosure: None. 10 Best Fitness and Gym Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
93,5e876ae4-4c0f-3b95-8159-b09bd92f9c86,VFC,2023-04-17,Top 10 Luxury Clothing Stocks to Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-luxury-clothing-stocks-210354634.html,1681679034,STORY,"['JWN', 'MC.PA', 'VFC', 'RL', 'GIII', 'CPRI', 'PVH', 'TPR']","[In this article, we will take a look at the top 10 luxury clothing stocks to buy. To see more such companies, go directly to Top 5 Luxury Clothing Stocks to Buy.The luxury goods market is famous for staying resilient and strong during recessionary environments. That’s because the rich and wealthy are usually the last to feel the real effects of rising inflation. Last year, when the broader turmoil in the stock market was crushing almost every other company, French luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC) was posting strong sales growth. During the company’s third quarter earnings call, answering a question about how the company was able to manage to outperform despite the difficult odds, LVMH’s CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony  very realistically pointed to a fact that explains the strength of the luxury goods market even when things start to go south:“Luxury is not a proxy for the general economy. We end up selling to affluent people and they have a behavior on their own, which is not necessarily totally aligned with economics.”During the last quarter of 2022, LVMH, along with some other luxury companies, saw a slowdown, mainly driven by COVID-19 outbreaks in China. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division posted organic sales growth of 10% during the period, which the company says was the slowest growth seen during 2022. However, the company said it started to see sales rebound in January 2023 after China reopened its economy. Jean-Jacques Guiony  said the company’s performance in China had  “recovered very significantly” in January and that “China has actually turned the page on the disruption of the pandemic.”How Does Luxury Business Remain Resilient Despite Inflation?Luxury companies like PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH), Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) and Capri Holdings Limited (NYSE:CPRI) aren’t totally immune to the economic realities, however. For example, LVMH’s chief Bernard Arnault said earlier this year that the company was “vigilant to current uncertainties.” But what makes the luxury sector strong in the face of global economic challenges is its ability to transfer rising costs to consumers. A December 2022 report from Financial Times says the prices of core handbags from Chanel and Louis Vuitton have jumped about 20% over the past two years, with more price hikes expected, especially in Europe. The report cited Citi luxury analyst Thomas Chauvet, who estimates that prices could rise by another 15% in 2023 in Europe and in the mid-single digits in the US and China.Story continuesAnother growth catalyst for the luxury sector comes from the emerging markets where wealth and consumers’ appetite to buy and boast luxury items keep increasing. Bain estimates that sales in the sector are expected to increase by a whopping 60% between 2022 and 2030, driven by the increase in luxury consumers from India, Mexico, South Korea and south-east Asia.The Benefits of Having The Top 1% As CustomersGlobal wealth increase that seems to buoy the top 1% also explains the robust growth of the luxury goods market. Bloomberg in a reported quoted data from Boston Consulting Group, which says that global wealth jumped 10.6% (adding $26 trillion) in 2021, clocking in the fastest rate in more than a decade. The coronavirus crisis also fueled consumer spending in the luxury goods market. The Bloomberg report cited Gachoucha Kretz, associate marketing professor at business school HEC Paris, who pointed to a trend he calls “revenge shopping” after the pandemic, in which consumers spend lavishly on the assumption that “life is short” and “‘I might as well enjoy today since I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.’”In this backdrop, it’s necessary to take a look at the top luxury clothing companies in which hedge funds are investing.Luxury Clothing Stocks to BuySorbis/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the holdings of 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and picked top 10 companies that make luxury clothing products.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Financial Services Stocks To Invest In Right Now.Strategist Makes The Case For Buying The Dip In FinancialsOn April 5 BMO Capital's Chief Investment Strategist, Brian Belski, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he made the case for investing in financial services stocks and also talked about his outlook for the second half of 2023. Belski thinks that investors should ""take two steps back"" and take an analytical, logical, and long-term approach right now. According to Belski, the market has devalued financial stocks and he thinks that there are three things that this may lead to. Firstly, Belski thinks that the opposite of what happened in the aftermath of the global financial crisis will happen right now. Back then, small and medium banks were among the best performers and large banks took a tumble. Belski thinks that large banks and Canadian banks ""will be the winners"" since they have strong balance sheets and the stability that investors want right now. Secondly, Belksi expects increased M&amp;A activity for small and medium-sized banks, given the issues the are currently dealing with. Finally, Belksi noted that he thinks there is going to be ""pointed regulation"" towards the small and medium-sized banks. Here are some comments from Brian Belski:""From a fundamental perspective, tier-1 capital ratios are 400 basis points above where we were in the great financial crisis. Loan-to-deposit ratios are very steady. Held-to-maturity securities are very pointed in those banks that were the ""bad behavior"" banks. We're seeing no systemic risk. But the financials, at 14% of the market, we believe would be a Strong Overweight here and propose a great value at these levels. You don't have to own them all, you have to be very select. And from our work with rising dispersion and rising earnings growth dispersion across the market, especially on a sector level, you absolutely positively have to be a stock picker.""Story continuesBrian Belski said ""stocks lead earnings, which lead the economy"" and if the economy shows signs of weakness, the Fed will stop its hiking cycle and start cutting interest rates. Belski thinks that the market will be relatively choppy in the first half of the year, but he expects things to pick up and the market to rally in the second half of 2022.As noted by Brian Belski, financials are currently trading at attractive valuations. However, the current market environment requires investors to be a ""stock picker"" and so, we have compiled a list of the best financial services stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. Looking at where institutional investors are placing their bets can help investors determine what may work as we head into the back half of the year. Some of the best financial services stocks to buy now according to hedge funds include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below.10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Invest In Right NowPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe scanned for financial services companies in Insider Monkey's database of 943 elite money managers. We narrowed down our selection to financial services stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Along with each stock, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment, analyst ratings, and top shareholders as well. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Invest In Right Now10. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) was spotted on 74 investors' portfolios that disclosed positions worth $8.1 billion in the company. Of those, GQG Partners was the top investor in the company and held a position worth $1.4 billion.This March, Citi analyst Christopher Allen updated his price target on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) to $65 from $75 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The stock is one of the best financial services stocks to invest in right now according to hedge funds.On March 29, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) disclosed that Marianne Brown, one of the company's directors, purchased $0.26 million worth of the company's common shares.LVS Advisory made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We exited The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) during the week leading up to the Silicon Valley Bank failure at a price in the high $60s. I sent an ad hoc note to partners on March 11 discussing our decision to sell the stock but I will add some additional context here. We invested in Charles Schwab during the summer of 2022 (discussed in our Q3 2022 letter) shortly after making our investment in Interactive Brokers. While Interactive Brokers is focused on faster-growing international markets and more sophisticated traders, Charles Schwab is a more mature US business focused on retirement accounts and wealth managers. Our investment thesis was that Schwab would benefit from higher interest rates and after years of investment would begin returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders.My view changed when it became clear that liquidity would become a greater issue for all banks in early March. We believe Schwab has enough liquidity to operate its business, but we no longer believe the company is in a position to return capital. Furthermore, Schwab saw a higher degree of deposit flight in Q4 than we expected leading us to believe the problem could get worse before it gets better. Schwab may even need to raise additional equity capital to reassure the market of its liquidity position which would drastically change the risk/reward calculation of investing in the stock. While we realized a ~6% loss on our investment, our ability to quickly recalibrate our views during the early stages of the March banking crisis prevented us from losing an additional 20%+ if we had held on until today.”9. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81This April, Barclays updated its price target on Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) to $59 from $61 and reiterated an Equal Weight rating on the shares.

(NYSE:C), hedge funds are also bullish on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).8. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87On April 14, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) announced market-beating earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported an EPS of $1.23 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.09. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $20.73 billion, up 17.83% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $669.31 million.

As is well known, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is the country’s third-largest bank, serving one in three U.S. households. Years of regulatory missteps under prior managements resulted in reputational damage, higher-than-average expenses, numerous consent orders, caps on asset growth, all added to the negative impact of low rates on their interest income. However, where others see bad news, we see resiliency and gradual improvement. Wells Fargo’s resiliency is reflected in the fact that despite years of terrible headlines and congressional hearings, Wells Fargo’s core customers stayed put and customer attrition remains extraordinarily low.As to gradual improvement, new management has made steady headway in closing consent orders, settling regulatory matters and upgrading systems. Thus, rather than increasing profits from growth, Wells Fargo’s earnings growth for the next three-to-five years should come from the combined tailwinds of rising interest income, partially offset by normalizing credit costs, reduced expenses as systems improve and the scandals of the last decade are gradually put behind them, and the return of excess capital through share repurchases and rising dividends. The hypothetical earnings bridge displayed in Figure 6 gives some sense of the earnings power we see unfolding in the years ahead for this durable financial franchise.While our grounded optimism carries the day, we are mindful of the risk that Wells Fargo’s historically excellent credit culture may have deteriorated, or that exasperated regulators may choose to extract even more major penalties for past infractions.”7. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Wall Street sees material upside to S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) and the stock is one of the best financial services stocks to invest in right now. This February, Argus analyst John Eade raised his price target on S&amp;P Global Inc.

As of December 31, TCI Fund Management is the most prominent investor in the company and has a stake worth $3 billion.Baron Funds made the following comment about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) increased 10.1% during the quarter as investors looked past weak debt issuance activity and anticipated a potential issuance rebound in 2023. Equity markets rose during the quarter, offering some reprieve to asset-based revenue headwinds. The company also hosted an Investor Day during which management provided medium-term financial guidance of 7% to 9% annual revenue growth and low to mid-teens annual EPS growth. We continue to own the stock due to the company’s durable growth characteristics that are underpinned by the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while also benefiting from significant competitive advantages.”6.

One of the key reasons for that is that blue-chips tend to do well even when overall markets are excessively volatile. Also, since many blue-chip stocks pay a dividend investors can be rewarded while they wait for the market to turn around. In fact, here are three cheap blue-chip stocks that make sense to put in your portfolio right now.PFEPfizer$41.47CALMCal-Maine Foods$56.08OXYOccidental Petroleum$64.77Pfizer (PFE) a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is down 22% over the last year. That’s thanks, in part, to declining demand for its  Comirnaty vaccine. If estimates are correct, Pfizer will generate approximately $69 billion in earnings in 2023. That’s about a 30% decline from its revenue in 2022. However, it’s also up from approximately $40 billion in 2020. That kind of growth doesn’t appear to be priced into the stock. And so far, investors remain lukewarm on Pfizer’s $43 billion acquisition of Seagen. This will further entrench Pfizer in the oncology sector, which is the largest growth driver in global medicine. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe payoff will take several years. But with a stock that’s trading at just 7.8x earnings and pays a dividend with a yield of just under 4% that it has been increasing for 12 consecutive years. It’s possible that the company may have to slow its dividend growth because of the Seagen acquisition, but outside of that, now is a good time to start accumulating shares of PFE stock. Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockAnalysts are cool on Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM). At the time of this writing, analysts are only giving CALM stock about an 8% upside from its closing price on April 12.. That’s likely because it appears that egg prices are easing.  I’ll admit that I thought the “eggs-ploitation” of egg prices was a little overdone. I’m not denying that egg prices were high. I do the shopping for my family. But the reason was known, a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak (HPAI) that put the hen population at historically low levels. But, for now, the outbreak appears to be under control.  Story continuesIt’s possible that CALM stock could see some pullback. Institutional investors plowed into the stock as revenue and earnings were soaring sequentially and year-over-year. It’s possible that the “smart money” will start to pull back as the company’s revenue and earnings are likely to take a hit as egg prices return to normal levels. Buf if the CPI is any indication, that’s still a long time off. And with CALM stock trading at around 3.4x earnings with a dividend that has a yield of over 9%, now may be an “egg-celent” time to take a position.  Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Source: ShutterstockEver since OPEC announced it was cutting oil production starting in May, crude oil has been on the rise. This has given a second wind to oil stocks that were starting to lose steam after a record-setting 2022. There are many cheap blue-chip stocks to choose from, but I’ll take Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY).  As many investors know, OXY is a favorite of Warren Buffett. Buffett purchased nearly 5.8 million additional shares of OXY stock in March. At the time he paid between $59.85 and $61.90. The stock is currently trading at over $64 a share and it will only go higher as oil prices continue to increase. In fact, it’s not unreasonable to believe we’ll see $100 oil sometime this year.  As a dividend stock, Occidental isn’t particularly impressive right now. The company slashed its dividend at the onset of the pandemic. But it’s been increasing it in the two years since. And that streak will be in no danger with rising oil prices and the company’s ability to generate over $13 billion in free cash flow in 2022. And being able to buy shares for just 5.2x earnings, could make OXY stock a steal among oil stocks. On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

97,e8fbe9e4-5cc7-3478-9494-86d1df8ec1dc,PFE,2023-04-17,7 Stocks That Will Surge in a Recession Scenario,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-surge-recession-scenario-200700815.html,1681416420,STORY,"['COST', 'CVX', 'LMT', 'GOLD', 'PFE', 'RIOT', 'NEM']","[As monetary policies remain tight, there is an increasing fear recession in 2023. While several sectors might be impacted, a recession is not necessarily bad news for all. In fact, there are many sectors where we can still find some of the best stocks for recession.It’s important to understand why investors should not panic in a recession scenario. First, equities discount events in advance and it’s likely that the recession factor is priced in the market. Furthermore, policymakers shift stance in a recession towards expansionary monetary policies. The government, invariably, focuses on stimulus packages. These potential actions are good for the markets as it boosts liquidity in the financial system.I would therefore focus on some of the best stocks for recession that can best index returns in the coming quarters. Most of the stocks discussed are low-beta stocks and ensure capital preservation and regular cash flow through dividends. Let’s discuss seven of the best stocks for recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNEMNewmont Corporation$51.05RIOTRiot Platforms$13.47CVXChevron$172.23PFEPfizer$41.54LMTLockheed Martin$491.70COSTCostco$497.94GOLDBarrick Gold$20.10Newmont Corporation (NEM)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockGold is already trending higher and I believe that the positive momentum is likely to sustain in a recession scenario. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is possibly the best proxy exposure to gold. The gold miner has an investment grade balance sheet and strong cash flow visibility.Newmont closed 2022 with a total liquidity buffer of $6.7 billion. For the period, the company’s net-debt-to-adjusted- EBITDA was 0.5x. The company also reported a healthy operating cash flow of $3.2 billion for 2022.With gold trading above $2,000 an ounce, the operating cash flow is likely to be in excess of $5 billion for the year. This would imply higher investments coupled with increased shareholder rewards. NEM stock currently offers a dividend yield of 3.2% and I expect healthy dividend growth if the rally for gold sustains. Overall, with strong fundamentals, robust cash flows, and an attractive dividend yield, NEM stock is attractive.Story continuesRiot Platforms (RIOT)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockIt’s worth noting that gold and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) have been some of the top performing assets in the first few months of 2023. I believe that Bitcoin will surge higher in a recessionary scenario, backed by a weak dollar. That being said, BTC mining stocks like Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) appear attractive.A strong balance sheet is a key reason to like Riot Platforms. The company ended 2022 with zero debt and $230 million in cash. Further, Riot holds 7,058 Bitcoin in its balance sheet. High financial flexibility will support aggressive growth plans.Riot has already been boosting mining capacity and expects capacity of 12.5EH/s by the second half of 2023. Last year, the company reported Bitcoin mining gross margin of 60.3%. Being a low-cost producer is another advantage for Riot. For the current year, healthy cash flows can be expected if Bitcoin remains in an uptrend.Chevron (CVX)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comIt’s interesting to note that oil has recovered quickly from 2023 lows of $65. There are two reasons for this sharp recovery. First, OPEC and its allies recently cut production to ensure that price is supported at higher levels. Further, the recession factor is discounted in the price and a potentially weak dollar will be positive for energy prices.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock has trended higher by 7% in the last six months. This is amidst volatility in oil price. I expect CVX to breakout on the upside in a recession scenario. Besides the weak dollar factor, investors will look for an investment grade balance sheet and healthy dividends. CVX stock is fundamentally strong and offers a dividend yield of 3.57%.It’s also worth noting that Chevron reported operating cash flow of $47.5 billion in 2022. With low break-even assets, OCF will remain strong even if oil is in the range of $80 to $90 per barrel. This will ensure sustained dividends and continued share repurchase.Pfizer (PFE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7In general, investors look for defensive low-beta stocks in a recession scenario. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), for example, is among the best in this segment and looks undervalued. PFE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.3 and offers a dividend yield of 3.9%.As funds flow into safe stocks with an attractive yield, PFE stock is likely to trend higher. Of course, the pharmaceutical sector is relatively immune to economic shocks.In terms of business development, there are two points to note. First, Pfizer has a deep pipeline of 110 drug candidates. The late-stage pipeline is attractive and will ensure steady revenue growth.Furthermore, Pfizer has witnessed significant cash inflow from the sale of covid-19 vaccines. The company is utilizing the improved financial flexibility for acquisition driven growth. The company expects to add $25 billion in incremental revenue from business development deals by 2030. Therefore, the overall outlook for Pfizer is optimistic and I would remain invested at current valuations.Lockheed Martin (LMT)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) also has a low-beta and offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.46%. With a forward P/E of 18, LMT stock looks undervalued and can trend higher as investors flee to safer stocks with an investment grade balance sheet.It’s worth noting that Lockheed has been benefiting as geopolitical tensions escalate. My point is underscored by the fact that the company’s order backlog has swelled to $150 billion as of Q4 2022. On a year-on-year basis, Lockheed reported a 11% growth in backlog.A healthy backlog provides clear cash flow visibility for the year and 2024. Last year, Lockheed reported free cash flow of $6.1 billion. Even if FCF remains stable at these levels, there is ample headroom for value creation.From a growth perspective, Lockheed has been investing in new technology like hypersonics. Further, orders from Europe are likely to improve in the coming years. LMT stock would therefore remain attractive even after an economic recovery.Costco Wholesale (COST)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) declined by 15% over the last 12 months. This does not come as a surprise with the retail sector being impacted by inflation. However, in a recession scenario, I expect a breakout to the upside for the stock.It’s important to note that the U.S. economy is consumption driven with retail spending being a key component. To pull the economy out of recession, policymakers are likely to focus on boosting consumption spending. This will benefit retailers in a recession scenario.I must also mention that Costco has been reporting decent numbers amidst challenges for the sector. For Q3 2023, the company reported 6.5% growth in revenue on a year-on-year basis to $54.24 billion. Potentially lower interest rates in the second half of 2023 or in 2024 will benefit Costco.I like the fact that Costco generates $4.3 billion in membership fee annually. With a high renewal rate and warehouse expansion, growth in recurring revenue will support cash flows.Barrick Gold (GOLD)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comBarrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) is another gold mining stock that I would buy and hold in a recession scenario. GOLD stock has edged higher marginally by 10% for year-to-date 2022. I believe that the best part of the rally for the stock is due in the coming quarters.Barrick Gold has an investment grade balance sheet and high cash flow potential. The company ended 2022 with a cash buffer of $4.4 billion. Further, operating cash flows for the year were $3.5 billion. At current gold price, it’s likely that OCF will be exceeding $5 billion. This would imply healthy dividend growth.The company is also attractive considering the asset base. Barrick ended 2022 with 76 million ounces in gold reserves. With strong financial flexibility, the company has clear cash flow visibility in the coming years.I must also mention that the company has guided for an all-in-sustaining-cost of less than $1,200 an ounce. Assuming a scenario where gold is in a long-term uptrend, EBITDA margin expansion will be significant.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Fox defamation trial,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-expect-dominion-v-fox-182222272.html,1681669342,STORY,['FOXA'],"[By Jack Queen(Reuters) - One of the most closely watched U.S. media trials in decades kicks off in a Delaware court on Tuesday as Fox Corp and Fox News face a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems over the network's coverage of false claims that the ballot-counter company rigged the 2020 presidential election.Here is an explanation of the case.WHAT IS DOMINION CLAIMING?Dominion in its lawsuit accused Fox of destroying its reputation and business by repeatedly airing false claims that its voting machines were used to rig the election against Republican then-President Donald Trump in favor of the winner, Democrat Joe Biden.Dominion has said Fox knew the claims were false but continued broadcasting them to appeal to its largely conservative audience and keep viewers from defecting to right-wing media competitors that embraced the conspiracy theory.The Denver-based company cited numerous internal Fox communications and deposition testimony that it has said proved that Fox personnel - show producers and hosts all the way up to the top executives - knew that guests who appeared on various programs and repeatedly made the false claims on air did not have evidence to back up their allegations.WHAT IS FOX'S DEFENSE?Fox has said Dominion cannot prove that the network knowingly spread falsehoods or recklessly disregarded the truth, the legal standard of ""actual malice"" that plaintiffs in defamation lawsuits must meet.Fox has argued that Dominion cherry-picked evidence to mischaracterize the network's coverage decisions, which it said were reasonable because election-rigging claims by the president's lawyers were inherently newsworthy. Fox has said it also gave Dominion's side of the story by airing its denials.The network was dealt a setback in March, when Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled that Fox could not invoke free speech defenses because the statements it aired were false, defamatory and not covered by legal protections for the press under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. Fox is now largely limited to arguing that Dominion cannot prove actual malice.Story continuesCOULD THE TWO SIDES STILL SETTLE?Yes. Neither side has publicly shown interesting in settling after two years of fierce litigation, but two sources told Reuters that Fox and Dominion were holding last-minute talks after Davis delayed the trial by one day on Monday without giving a reason.Both sides they are litigating on principal. Dominion has argued that Fox's conduct was damaging to American democracy and that the network must be held accountable for crossing the line between journalism and the heedless pursuit of ratings. Fox has called Dominion's lawsuit an assault on the free press and framed its stance in the case as a defense of journalism and diversity of ideas in the public square.But Fox faces a potentially enormous judgment because in addition to $1.6 billion, Dominion is also seeking punitive damages in any amount jurors see fit.Another U.S. voting company, Smartmatic, is seeking $2.7 billion from Fox in a similar lawsuit pending in New York County Supreme Court.WHAT ABOUT DAMAGES?Fox has attacked the credibility of Dominion's damages estimate, saying it is based upon unrealistic growth projections and faulty assumptions. The network has said Dominion was worth only $80 million in 2018 and has continued to grow and post strong revenues despite the untrue claims of election-rigging.Dominion has defended its damages model, which it has said was based on industry standard accounting methods. An expert report commissioned by the company attributed scores of lost contracts to Fox's coverage, though much of the report remains under seal. More of those details are likely to come out when Dominion's expert testifies.(Reporting by Jack Queen; Editing by Will Dunham and Noeleen Walder)]"

106,cd48c814-2c54-3ba8-b74b-2fada5d935db,V,2023-04-17,Institutional investors control 77% of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and were rewarded last week after stock increased 3.4%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-control-77-visa-120025750.html,1681732825,STORY,['V'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Visa implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the company Insiders have sold recently Every investor in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$16b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 11% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Visa. View our latest analysis for Visa ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Visa. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Visa, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Visa. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.2% of shares outstanding. With 6.1% and 3.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of VisaWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Visa Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$253m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 22% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Visa better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Visa has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Source: Source: TID International (India)Marriott plans to have 250 properties across India by 2025, including hotels that are open and in the pipeline. “We’re in 40 cities today, that should be 50 cities or more by 2025,” said Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano, adding that this would help create 10,000 new jobs in the country. Capuano, who was visiting India last week, spoke about his meeting with the Indian tourism minister during which they discussed the importance of continuing to tell the story about the rich and diverse set of experiences that the country offers. “And we want to make sure we have lodging options in all of those diverse destinations,” Capuano said. Reiterating Marriott’s “relatively simple” development strategy of providing the right product in every market the travelers want to visit for any type of trips, Capuano said the hotel group would continue to stay focused on India’s “strong and growing” domestic market. However, he did mention that the hotel group is a long way off as far as opportunity for luxury in India is concerned. “I think we’re in our infancy of growing our industry portfolio in luxury. That’s probably an area where we’ll continue to focus on,” Capuano said. True to Capuano’s statements, global hotels brands have been exploring the potential of India’s luxury market with Hilton’s last week announcement of the debut of the Waldorf Astoria brand in India and Radisson announcing the launch of its Radisson Collection in the country. Capuano also went to to talk about India witnessing a strong traction for branded residential properties, which Marriott launched in the country early this year. While 2020 and 2021 were the two most challenging years in the history of the hospitality business, interestingly, these were the two strongest years in the history of Marriott’s branded residential business, said Capuano. “The launch of Homes &amp; Villas, allowed us to keep our customers within the Bonvoy ecosystem and it’s not coincidental that we saw our volume of listings grow more than 20-fold over the two years of the pandemic,” Capuano said. And when asked to choose his favorite India-based hotel brand, Capuano couldn’t resist naming the Taj. “Taj is an iconic brand on a global basis. They have generated some of the world’s most extraordinary leaders who have taken their expertise global,” Capuano said.Story continuesTata Group-owned Air India will start taxibot operations for its A320 aircraft fleet at Delhi and Bengaluru airports, a move that has the potential to save up to 15,000 tons of jet fuel over three years. The airline has entered into an agreement with New Delhi-based company KSU Aviation to launch the operations, the airline said in a statement. A semi-robotic equipment, the taxibot, once attached to the aircraft, acts as an extension of the aircraft’s nose landing gear. It is used to tow aircraft from the airport terminal gate to the taxi-out point and tow aircraft from the terminal gate after landing (taxi-in phase) without utilizing the aircraft’s engines, thus saving jet fuel. The technology curbs fuel consumption, carbon emissions, noise levels, as well as costs for airlines.India’s mid-market hotel chain Lemon Tree Hotels has signed franchise agreements for two hotels — Lemon Tree Premier and Lemon Tree Resort, in Budhanilkantha and Lumbini in Nepal, respectively. Scheduled to open in or before January 2024, Lemon Tree Premier in Kathmandu will feature 102 rooms, two restaurants, one restobar, a private dining room, three meeting rooms, banquet hall, outdoor venues for events, swimming pool, fitness center, spa, casino and other public areas. Lemon Tree Resort, Lumbini is expected to open in or before October this year. The 81-key hotel will feature a restaurant, bar, meeting rooms, an outdoor event venue, a private dining room and other public areas. “We are gradually making forays in the international market and expanding our portfolio in Nepal to strengthen our regional presence,” said Vilas Pawar, chief executive officer of franchise business at Lemon Tree Hotels.Domestic air traffic was only 4 percent shorter in fiscal year 2023 as compared to pre-pandemic levels, credit rating agency ICRA said in a report. “For fiscal year 2023, domestic passenger traffic is estimated at around 136 million, a year over year growth analysis of around 60 percent over 85.2 million in fiscal year 2022, and only short of around 4 percent, compared to pre-Covid levels of 141.5 million in fiscal year 2020,” said Suprio Banerjee, vice president and sector head of corporate ratings at ICRA. Meanwhile, domestic air traffic has again picked up pace during the current financial year 2022-23, and is expected to reach around 97 percent of the pre-Covid level, according to Civil Aviation Minister VK Singh.Indian Railways will run 217 special trains to make 4,010 trips during this summer to handle the extra rush, the ministry of railways said in a statement. The special trains have been planned to connect major destinations across the country on railway routes, it said. While the south western railway and south central railway have notified the highest number of 69 and 48 special trains, respectively, the western railway and southern railway have notified 40 and 20 such trains. Zones like the east central railway and central railway have notified 10 special trains each, while north western Railway has notified 16. The summer season usually sees an increase in railway passengers, and the special trains aim to reduce the crowd and provide ease of travel.Tata Group’s Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) will operate its luxury hotel brand Taj at Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) in the south Indian state of Kerala at an estimated investment of $12.2 million. Scheduled to be launched by mid-2024, the 112-key hotel will feature a 440 square meter banquet hall, two boardrooms, and a terrace dining area offering a panoramic view of the airport. The hotel, located near the airport’s entrance, was constructed as part of CIAL’s land utilization programme and to provide passengers with hospitality services on par with international standards, a statement by CIAL read. CIAL has completed the civil and allied works of the hotel, which will be handed over to IHCL soon for the development of the interiors. As per the contract, IHCL will share a percentage of the gross revenue generated from its operation with CIAL.Indian airports operator Airports Authority of India (AAI) has achieved its highest ever capital expenditure of $634.2 million in the fiscal year 2022-23, it said in a tweet. AAI is investing the amount to expand and enhance airport facilities, upgrade technology and improve operational efficiency, it added. This investment is expected to bring about a transformation in the Indian aviation industry, as it aims to enhance passenger experience and increase airport capacity. India will invest around $12 billion over the next two years in airports, aircraft and recruitment to meet the booming demand for air travel. The country aims to increase the number of airports from the present 148 to 220 by 2025, for which private builders will contribute roughly $9 billion, with the balance coming from AAI.Indian hospitality chain Cygnett Hotels &amp; Resorts has announced the signing of their first property in Sonipat in the north Indian state of Haryana. Set to open in the coming months, the hotel will offer 42 rooms, a restaurant, multiple banqueting and conferencing facilities, capable of accommodating up to 900 guests. “This hotel is a significant addition to our rapidly expanding portfolio of hotels in the country. We are confident that it will create a niche market for itself in the region,” said Sarbendra Sarkar, founder and managing director of Cygnett Hotels &amp; Resorts.Mumbai airport is witnessing 14 percent more weekly flights this summer compared to last year. Airlines currently operate 966 daily flights to and from the airport, as against 820 in the previous summer schedule of 2022. This year the summer schedule runs from March 26 to October 28. “Increased demand for domestic and international travel movement from CSMIA has fueled the rise in the overall flight operations, which in turn will benefit the travelers from Mumbai and neighboring cities. Moreover, the summer schedule will have additional services to 24 destinations,” a Mumbai International Airport Limited spokesperson said. IndiGo caters to 47 percent of weekly movements, followed by Air India with 17 percent and Vistara with 14 percent of the weekly flight movements.The Delhi government is likely to make a fresh move for reopening liquor vends at Delhi airport’s domestic terminal, closed since September last year, according to a report by news agency Press Trust of India. Officials of the Delhi Tourism and Transport Development Corporation (DTTDC) authorized to run liquor stores in the capital said earlier talks were held with the airport authorities but the shops could not be opened. “We had held talks with airport authorities concerned in the past but the rentals quoted by them were too steep. It could have turned the whole exercise of running liquor stores at the domestic terminal into a loss making venture,” said a senior officer. “We will soon approach the airport authorities, hoping to find a solution with a reasonable rent for the shops,” the officer added.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

According to a new survey from Realtor.com® and HarrisX, the vast majority (86%) of those planning to sell their home in the next 12 months are also planning to buy a new home. And because most of these sellers will be taking on a new mortgage, this creates a major affordability hurdle. In fact, 82% of these seller-buyers feel ""locked in"" by their currently low mortgage rate. As a result, more than half of seller-buyers (56%) who are planning to sell in the next 12 months said they are waiting for rates to come down, while 25% need to sell soon for personal reasons.""One positive aspect that came out of the pandemic was historically low mortgage rates – and many people took advantage of this opportunity to buy their first home, upgrade to a more expensive home or refinance the home they were in,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Unfortunately, this comes with a bit of a catch-22, as homeowners who locked in a 30-year fixed rate in the 2-3% range don't necessarily want to give that up in exchange for a rate in the 6-7% range.""Home equity at all-time highsThe good news for sellers is that they have a lot of equity in their current home. Eighty-five percent of potential sellers are happy with the amount of equity they have in their home. Specifically, 74% estimate that they have more than $100,000 in home equity and 20% estimate that number to be more than $300,000.Sellers still have sky-high expectationsDespite higher mortgage rates, sellers still have high expectations for their home sale, in many cases even higher than potential sellers who were surveyed in Aug. 2022. Thirty-three percent of potential sellers said that they want to take advantage of the current market and think they can make a profit. Even in this shifting market:Story continues43% expect to get their asking price (up from 27% in 2022)37% expect to have an offer within a week (compared to 33% in 2022)35% expect buyers to be willing to forgo contingencies like inspections and appraisals to make the deal (compared to 30% in 2022)34% expect an all-cash offer (up from 22% in 2022)31% expect to get more than their asking price (compared to 30% in 2022)27% expect a bidding war to take place (compared to 32% in 2022)""Given the changing housing market, it's important for buyers and sellers alike to have realistic expectations heading into a home sale,"" said Hannah Jones, Realtor.com® economic data analyst. ""By understanding the local market, sellers can make sure that they're pricing their home well to help ensure a quick sale and avoid a home that lingers on the market.""Survey MethodologyThe survey was conducted online from Feb. 3-10, 2023, among 2,286 adults in the U.S. by HarrisX. The sampling margin of error of this poll is +/- 2.1 percentage points and larger for subgroups. The results reflect a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.

114,5e876ae4-4c0f-3b95-8159-b09bd92f9c86,TPR,2023-04-17,Top 10 Luxury Clothing Stocks to Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-luxury-clothing-stocks-210354634.html,1681679034,STORY,"['JWN', 'MC.PA', 'VFC', 'RL', 'GIII', 'CPRI', 'PVH', 'TPR']","[In this article, we will take a look at the top 10 luxury clothing stocks to buy. To see more such companies, go directly to Top 5 Luxury Clothing Stocks to Buy.The luxury goods market is famous for staying resilient and strong during recessionary environments. That’s because the rich and wealthy are usually the last to feel the real effects of rising inflation. Last year, when the broader turmoil in the stock market was crushing almost every other company, French luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC) was posting strong sales growth. During the company’s third quarter earnings call, answering a question about how the company was able to manage to outperform despite the difficult odds, LVMH’s CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony  very realistically pointed to a fact that explains the strength of the luxury goods market even when things start to go south:“Luxury is not a proxy for the general economy. We end up selling to affluent people and they have a behavior on their own, which is not necessarily totally aligned with economics.”During the last quarter of 2022, LVMH, along with some other luxury companies, saw a slowdown, mainly driven by COVID-19 outbreaks in China. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division posted organic sales growth of 10% during the period, which the company says was the slowest growth seen during 2022. However, the company said it started to see sales rebound in January 2023 after China reopened its economy. Jean-Jacques Guiony  said the company’s performance in China had  “recovered very significantly” in January and that “China has actually turned the page on the disruption of the pandemic.”How Does Luxury Business Remain Resilient Despite Inflation?Luxury companies like PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH), Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) and Capri Holdings Limited (NYSE:CPRI) aren’t totally immune to the economic realities, however. For example, LVMH’s chief Bernard Arnault said earlier this year that the company was “vigilant to current uncertainties.” But what makes the luxury sector strong in the face of global economic challenges is its ability to transfer rising costs to consumers. A December 2022 report from Financial Times says the prices of core handbags from Chanel and Louis Vuitton have jumped about 20% over the past two years, with more price hikes expected, especially in Europe. The report cited Citi luxury analyst Thomas Chauvet, who estimates that prices could rise by another 15% in 2023 in Europe and in the mid-single digits in the US and China.Story continuesAnother growth catalyst for the luxury sector comes from the emerging markets where wealth and consumers’ appetite to buy and boast luxury items keep increasing. Bain estimates that sales in the sector are expected to increase by a whopping 60% between 2022 and 2030, driven by the increase in luxury consumers from India, Mexico, South Korea and south-east Asia.The Benefits of Having The Top 1% As CustomersGlobal wealth increase that seems to buoy the top 1% also explains the robust growth of the luxury goods market. Bloomberg in a reported quoted data from Boston Consulting Group, which says that global wealth jumped 10.6% (adding $26 trillion) in 2021, clocking in the fastest rate in more than a decade. The coronavirus crisis also fueled consumer spending in the luxury goods market. The Bloomberg report cited Gachoucha Kretz, associate marketing professor at business school HEC Paris, who pointed to a trend he calls “revenge shopping” after the pandemic, in which consumers spend lavishly on the assumption that “life is short” and “‘I might as well enjoy today since I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.’”In this backdrop, it’s necessary to take a look at the top luxury clothing companies in which hedge funds are investing.Luxury Clothing Stocks to BuySorbis/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the holdings of 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and picked top 10 companies that make luxury clothing products.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Speaking of fresh names, we established a new position in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during the second half. We began accumulating shares after the company reported two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses, which brought the stock down by about 75% from peak to trough. Our investment in Netflix is a good example of what we categorize as a “temporary dislocation” and a great example of the historical investments we’ve made in the tech sector. Unlike other “value” investors, we don’t arbitrarily put tech in the “too hard” pile. We are comfortable and more than happy to underwrite investments in the industry. We just demand a margin of safety when doing it (something often ignored by other investors in the industry). That margin of safety opened up when consensus quickly concluded that Netflix’s growth was over, on the heels of two quarters of subscriber losses, which happened to follow years of surging lock-down-induced demand. The popular narrative was that by pursuing advertising revenue, Netflix was all but admitting that streaming television was completely saturated. We thought otherwise. With ~ 75MM subscribers in the US, even converting a small portion of those 100MM moochers would move the needle3. And given the superiority of the company’s technology and first-party user data, we think the consensus is completely underestimating the long-term potential of a Netflix advertising model.”Some of analysts' and hedge funds' top tech stock picks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Click to continue reading and see 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:12 Best Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy10 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Buy Now11 High-Dividend Stocks Picked By Billionaire Ray DalioDisclosure: None. 10 Best FAANG Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals Air Products and Chemicals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP, Sean Major, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$152k worth of shares at a price of US$313 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$286. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. Sean Major was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Air Products and Chemicals Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Air Products and Chemicals insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$211m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Air Products and Chemicals Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Air Products and Chemicals insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Air Products and Chemicals, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Air Products and Chemicals has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.Of course Air Products and Chemicals may not be the best stock to buy.

Fox defamation trial,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-expect-dominion-v-fox-182222272.html,1681669342,STORY,['FOXA'],"[By Jack Queen(Reuters) - One of the most closely watched U.S. media trials in decades kicks off in a Delaware court on Tuesday as Fox Corp and Fox News face a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems over the network's coverage of false claims that the ballot-counter company rigged the 2020 presidential election.Here is an explanation of the case.WHAT IS DOMINION CLAIMING?Dominion in its lawsuit accused Fox of destroying its reputation and business by repeatedly airing false claims that its voting machines were used to rig the election against Republican then-President Donald Trump in favor of the winner, Democrat Joe Biden.Dominion has said Fox knew the claims were false but continued broadcasting them to appeal to its largely conservative audience and keep viewers from defecting to right-wing media competitors that embraced the conspiracy theory.The Denver-based company cited numerous internal Fox communications and deposition testimony that it has said proved that Fox personnel - show producers and hosts all the way up to the top executives - knew that guests who appeared on various programs and repeatedly made the false claims on air did not have evidence to back up their allegations.WHAT IS FOX'S DEFENSE?Fox has said Dominion cannot prove that the network knowingly spread falsehoods or recklessly disregarded the truth, the legal standard of ""actual malice"" that plaintiffs in defamation lawsuits must meet.Fox has argued that Dominion cherry-picked evidence to mischaracterize the network's coverage decisions, which it said were reasonable because election-rigging claims by the president's lawyers were inherently newsworthy. Fox has said it also gave Dominion's side of the story by airing its denials.The network was dealt a setback in March, when Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled that Fox could not invoke free speech defenses because the statements it aired were false, defamatory and not covered by legal protections for the press under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. Fox is now largely limited to arguing that Dominion cannot prove actual malice.Story continuesCOULD THE TWO SIDES STILL SETTLE?Yes. Neither side has publicly shown interesting in settling after two years of fierce litigation, but two sources told Reuters that Fox and Dominion were holding last-minute talks after Davis delayed the trial by one day on Monday without giving a reason.Both sides they are litigating on principal. Dominion has argued that Fox's conduct was damaging to American democracy and that the network must be held accountable for crossing the line between journalism and the heedless pursuit of ratings. Fox has called Dominion's lawsuit an assault on the free press and framed its stance in the case as a defense of journalism and diversity of ideas in the public square.But Fox faces a potentially enormous judgment because in addition to $1.6 billion, Dominion is also seeking punitive damages in any amount jurors see fit.Another U.S. voting company, Smartmatic, is seeking $2.7 billion from Fox in a similar lawsuit pending in New York County Supreme Court.WHAT ABOUT DAMAGES?Fox has attacked the credibility of Dominion's damages estimate, saying it is based upon unrealistic growth projections and faulty assumptions. The network has said Dominion was worth only $80 million in 2018 and has continued to grow and post strong revenues despite the untrue claims of election-rigging.Dominion has defended its damages model, which it has said was based on industry standard accounting methods. An expert report commissioned by the company attributed scores of lost contracts to Fox's coverage, though much of the report remains under seal. More of those details are likely to come out when Dominion's expert testifies.(Reporting by Jack Queen; Editing by Will Dunham and Noeleen Walder)]"

(NYSE:CMI) stock gained 6.0% last week, insiders who sold US$3.3m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Selling at an average price of US$239, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At CumminsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Senior Vice President, Livingston Satterthwaite, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$230 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$234. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 6.6% of Livingston Satterthwaite's holding.Cummins insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Cummins Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Cummins. Specifically, Independent Director Georgia Nelson ditched US$985k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Cummins insiders own about US$148m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Cummins Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Cummins stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Cummins makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Brands, Inc.'s (NYSE:YUM) Share Price Indicate?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-yum-brands-inc-nyse-110015144.html,1681729215,STORY,['YUM'],"[Let's talk about the popular Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM). The company's shares had a relatively subdued couple of weeks in terms of changes in share price, which continued to float around the range of US$125 to US$135. However, is this the true valuation level of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Yum! Brands’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Yum! Brands Is Yum! Brands Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 28.51x is currently well-above the industry average of 19.89x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. Furthermore, Yum! Brands’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach levels around its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from Yum! Brands?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Yum! Brands' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 32%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? YUM’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe YUM should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on YUM for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for YUM, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for Yum! Brands you should be mindful of and 2 of these can't be ignored.If you are no longer interested in Yum!

137,30c40af6-49be-37c4-ac62-d7b00c76ee91,TRIP,2023-04-17,11 Best Tech Stocks to Buy On the Dip,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-tech-stocks-buy-204345302.html,1681677825,STORY,"['LPSN', 'UPWK', 'TRIP', 'ADP']","[In this article, we will take a look at the top 11 best tech stocks to buy on the dip. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Tech Stocks to Buy On the Dip.Tech stocks have showed remarkable resilience in 2023 in the face of rising interest rates and an uncertain economic outlook. The tech-heavy NASDAQ index is up over 14% year to date through April 11. But is this rally in tech stocks sustainable? Analysts and investors have sharp differences on the matter but one thing everyone agrees on is that you should buy on company fundamentals and not based on any irrational market assumptions.“Technology is Interesting Again”Recently, billionaire Chase Coleman of Tiger Global recommended big tech stocks as the tiger cub believes “technology is interesting again.”Coleman is bullish on tech due to the rise of new technologies like AI. He referred to the potential benefits of ChatGPT’s integration with Amazon to support the online shopping experience. Taking at an event, Coleman said:“Think about it in terms of companies investing in these technologies, and how well they use it…It’s going to be gradual. Be patient.”Coleman’s confidence comes despite his hedge fund posting huge losses suffered due to the tech rout in 2022.However, some are skeptical of the tech rally.According to a Bloomberg report, Wei Li, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc., said that the tech outperformance this year “is a bit overdone."" Li said that the rally is driven by expectations that the Federal Reserve will start to cut rates.JPMorgan Asset Management Global Market Strategist Meera Pandi agrees with the notion that the Fed’s policy is the ultimate decider of the tech stocks’ trajectory instead of company fundamentals. In an interview with Bloomberg, Pandi said that history shows that market cycles and economic cycles are not in total synchronization and during recessions markets begin to bottom before the worst of the recession is behind us.Story continuesPandi said that tech sector proved to be somewhat defensive in the last recession (she was referring to the pandemic crisis). She believes many of the companies in the tech sector that are taking the lead today are high-quality, blue-chip companies. But the analyst said she is concerned about companies that are overvalued. Another problem Pandi pointed out relates to concentration. The analyst highlighted that the top 10 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index account for about 30% of the index and just 20% of the total profits.While major tech stocks have been gaining value this year, there are a few quality stocks that present an attractive buying opportunity. Amid uncertainty and volatility, those who want to pile into tech stocks should do so based on long-term growth catalysts.Best Tech Stocks to Buy On the DipPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor this article, we first listed down at least 50 notable tech stocks that are down more than 4% over the past six months. We then selected 11 of these stocks with the highest number of hedge fund shareholders. The idea was to select best tech stocks according to smart money investors that are currently down and present an attractive entry point for investors. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors.Best Tech Stocks to Buy On the Dip11. Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13Share Price Decline in the Past Six Months: 71%Shares of vacation rental platform company Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) have lost a whopping 71% over the past six months. Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) has been getting hammered after the company posted its weak Q4 report which shows elevated churn. Oppenheiner analyst Jed Kelly downgraded Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) and said in a note that churn is on a downward trend throughout the industry.Despite huge losses, Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) could be a long-term stock pick for patient investors. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 13 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) was Jim Davidson, Dave Roux and Glenn Hutchins’ Silver Lake Partners which owns a $79 million stake in the company.10. LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Share Price Decline in the Past Six Months: 38%LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) stock has been taking it on the chin since the company posted weak Q4 results. After the earnings report, Credit Suisse’s Fred Lee upgraded LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) to Neutral from Underperform, acknowledging that the company posted “extremely weak results.” The analyst, however, believes LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) is going through a “much-needed restructuring.”LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) recently sold its online psychic reading service Kasamba.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 20 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN). The net value of these stakes was $129 million. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) was Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP which owns a $71 million stake in the company.Here is what Artisan Small Cap Fund has to say about LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“LivePerson is a leading provider of mobile and online messaging solutions. We believe customer service and sales centers are shifting from voice to digital communications, and LivePerson is wellequipped to lead this shift. Its LiveEngage cloud-based platform allows brands to engage with customers across digital channels at scale, more efficiently and more effectively. The market opportunity is substantial and goes well beyond digital conversations in service contexts and into areas such as sales, marketing and possibly social media monitoring. A key part of our thesis when we began our investment campaign in 2018 was the arrival of Alex Spinelli as the company’s CTO. Mr. Spinelli came from Amazon, where he was one of the architects and leaders of Alexa. In addition, Mr. Spinelli brought several well-respected technologists to LivePerson with him. Unfortunately, Mr. Spinelli announced his departure from LivePerson in Q3. In addition to this development, our profit cycle thesis has been stalled as the company makes a round of investments into its sales force which will weigh on margins over the near term. We believe Mr. Spinelli’s replacement, Andrew Hamel, carries the credentials to continue leading LivePerson’s technology efforts. Mr. Spinelli worked for Mr. Hamel at Amazon, and the investments in the sales force have the potential to allow the company to scale its business more rapidly. Still, we are in a holding pattern until we gain conviction that the profit cycle we originally invested in can continue to flourish with these changes.”9. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Share Price Decline in the Past Six Months: 5.3%Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) ranks 9th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy on the dip. In March, Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) made it the list of dividend growers stocks shared by BofA.

(NASDAQ:UPWK) is one of the leaders in the freelance market, whose value could reach about $12 billion through 2028 according to some estimates. While Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK) is facing some pressure amid the global macroeconomic challenges, the stock could be a solid long-term opportunity. During the fourth quarter, Upwork Inc.

AppLovin Corporation (NYSE:APP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Share Price Decline in the Past Six Months: 10%AppLovin Corporation (NYSE:APP) in March said that out of the $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents it has, less than $2 million were at the Silicon Valley Bank.In February, AppLovin Corporation (NYSE:APP) posted its Q4 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at -$0.21, missing estimates by $0.26. Revenue in the quarter fell 11.4% to total $702 million, beating estimates by $11.83 million. For the first quarter of 2023, AppLovin Corporation (NYSE:APP) expects revenue in the range of $685 million to $705 million versus the consensus estimate of $677.13 million.Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We fully exited AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP). AppLovin was a mistake that we were still trading and therefore did not discuss in our second quarter letter. AppLovin owns a portfolio of over 300 mobile games and operates an advertising platform for third party gaming apps. Our investment case hinged on the company’s advertising platform data from the owned games business which we believed was its key competitive advantage. Through our recent research, we concluded that management is likely planning to restructure or sell all or some of the owned games business. In addition, while we thought AppLovin’s second quarter results were good, with revenue up 16%, the company lowered guidance on its long-term organic growth opportunity. To achieve their long-term plans, the company is relying on new initiatives which we would categorize as early stage. As our understanding of a company’s competitive advantage changes, we reevaluate the business to determine how this affects our investment thesis.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.64bUS$6.81bUS$4.83bUS$5.20bUS$5.10bUS$5.07bUS$5.09bUS$5.13bUS$5.19bUS$5.26bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -0.55%Est @ 0.24%Est @ 0.79%Est @ 1.17%Est @ 1.44% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$6.9kUS$5.6kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.1kUS$2.8kUS$2.6kUS$2.4kUS$2.2kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$66bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$66b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$25bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$60b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$64.5, the company appears about fair value at a 2.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.374. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Occidental PetroleumStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

One of the key reasons for that is that blue-chips tend to do well even when overall markets are excessively volatile. Also, since many blue-chip stocks pay a dividend investors can be rewarded while they wait for the market to turn around. In fact, here are three cheap blue-chip stocks that make sense to put in your portfolio right now.PFEPfizer$41.47CALMCal-Maine Foods$56.08OXYOccidental Petroleum$64.77Pfizer (PFE) a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is down 22% over the last year. That’s thanks, in part, to declining demand for its  Comirnaty vaccine. If estimates are correct, Pfizer will generate approximately $69 billion in earnings in 2023. That’s about a 30% decline from its revenue in 2022. However, it’s also up from approximately $40 billion in 2020. That kind of growth doesn’t appear to be priced into the stock. And so far, investors remain lukewarm on Pfizer’s $43 billion acquisition of Seagen. This will further entrench Pfizer in the oncology sector, which is the largest growth driver in global medicine. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe payoff will take several years. But with a stock that’s trading at just 7.8x earnings and pays a dividend with a yield of just under 4% that it has been increasing for 12 consecutive years. It’s possible that the company may have to slow its dividend growth because of the Seagen acquisition, but outside of that, now is a good time to start accumulating shares of PFE stock. Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockAnalysts are cool on Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM). At the time of this writing, analysts are only giving CALM stock about an 8% upside from its closing price on April 12.. That’s likely because it appears that egg prices are easing.  I’ll admit that I thought the “eggs-ploitation” of egg prices was a little overdone. I’m not denying that egg prices were high. I do the shopping for my family. But the reason was known, a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak (HPAI) that put the hen population at historically low levels. But, for now, the outbreak appears to be under control.  Story continuesIt’s possible that CALM stock could see some pullback. Institutional investors plowed into the stock as revenue and earnings were soaring sequentially and year-over-year. It’s possible that the “smart money” will start to pull back as the company’s revenue and earnings are likely to take a hit as egg prices return to normal levels. Buf if the CPI is any indication, that’s still a long time off. And with CALM stock trading at around 3.4x earnings with a dividend that has a yield of over 9%, now may be an “egg-celent” time to take a position.  Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Source: ShutterstockEver since OPEC announced it was cutting oil production starting in May, crude oil has been on the rise. This has given a second wind to oil stocks that were starting to lose steam after a record-setting 2022. There are many cheap blue-chip stocks to choose from, but I’ll take Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY).  As many investors know, OXY is a favorite of Warren Buffett. Buffett purchased nearly 5.8 million additional shares of OXY stock in March. At the time he paid between $59.85 and $61.90. The stock is currently trading at over $64 a share and it will only go higher as oil prices continue to increase. In fact, it’s not unreasonable to believe we’ll see $100 oil sometime this year.  As a dividend stock, Occidental isn’t particularly impressive right now. The company slashed its dividend at the onset of the pandemic. But it’s been increasing it in the two years since. And that streak will be in no danger with rising oil prices and the company’s ability to generate over $13 billion in free cash flow in 2022. And being able to buy shares for just 5.2x earnings, could make OXY stock a steal among oil stocks. On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Fintech Stocks to Buy at a Discount.It seems nothing is going in the favor of the fintech sector since 2022, when things started to take a horrible turn for the industry that is highly vulnerable to high interest rates and economic volatility. The fintech sector was teeming with highly overvalued firms making big claims about their products and services. These companies had heavy debt loads and weak fundamentals. When easy money started to evaporate in 2022, so did their stock prices. The Global X Fintech ETF fell a whopping 52% in 2022, much higher than the losses recorded by the financial and tech sectors separately.Major fintech firms were just not ready to face the harsh realities that changed the industry dynamics as the pandemic-induced trends started to recede. For example, companies like PayPal and Shopify, emboldened by the rising trend of online shopping, assumed the high growth trajectory of online shopping was here to stay. When in-store shopping made a comeback, these companies had to make painful adjustments. Another shock to these companies came after the retreat of retail investors. As tech stocks and the broader market started to collapse, retail investor activity slowed down, hurting companies like Robinhood, which had hired thousands of employees to keep up with the growth that came after the meme stock mania seen during the pandemic days. Eventually, Robinhood had to announce a 23% cut in its workforce.Another blow to the fintech sector came amid the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank.However, this broader downturn in the fintech industry is exactly what makes certain stocks in the sector worthy of attention these days since they are currently trading at a discount and could rebound sharply once the economy begins to turn the corner.An Opportunity in the Fintech SpaceBMO Capital Markets Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski recently said in a note that the selloff in the financials sector is overdone and based on unfounded fears.Story continues""From our perspective, we believe these banking crisis and systemic risk fears are misguided as the recent bank failures were idiosyncratic in nature and ultimately self-inflicted by business mismanagement,"" Belski thinks.The analyst thinks the financial system is ""quite stable.” He thinks that the sharp decline in the S&amp;P 500 Financial is a “buying opportunity for investors, particularly given the attractive valuations, dividend attributes, and high quality tilt that continues to underpin the sector.""Best Fintech Stocks to Buy at a DiscountPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scoured the fintech industry and picked stocks that are down over the past one year, six months or one month and have strong growth catalysts or hedge fund sentiment. Some of these stocks are already on their path to recovery and can see more gains in the coming months as the Federal Reserve begins to pause and eventually cut rate hikes.Best Fintech Stocks to Buy at a Discount13.

Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) has a PE ratio of 5.49 as of April 12. In February, UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) shared a list of top dividend stocks picked up by its machine learning model. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), which has a dividend yield of about 2.2%, made it to the list.

The company’s two main consumer-facing lending businesses are credit cards and autos. Credit quality trends in both lines have followed a similar path, as seen in Figure 4. Delinquencies and charge-offs declined in 2020– 2021 relative to pre-COVID-19 levels, but more recently they’ve started to experience an uptick in delinquencies (which naturally would precede any increase in charge-offs). So, the trajectory does suggest that the credit environment is deteriorating from what it was, but the absolute level of the trend remains favorable relative to the longer-term past. As Capital One’s CEO Rich Fairbank recently noted, “It would be very abnormal if we were not seeing normalization.”We try to avoid making forecasts about macroeconomic variables, though given the Federal Reserve’s desire to rein in inflation through tighter monetary policy, a recession within the next year or so remains the most plausible scenario. Regardless of exactly how the next six- to-eighteen months play out we’ve always assumed that our companies would need to live through a recession at some point during our holding period.The important question is, how well prepared are the companies to get through it? Their first line of defense is the allowance for loan losses that has already been booked. Accounting rules require a company to make a “life of loan” estimate of total credit losses, so their existing allowance already reflects a consensus economic outlook that calls for a slowing economy and a gradual rise in the unemployment rate. The actual path taken by the economy can of course veer adversely from the current outlook, but the point is that banks’ reserves already incorporate a down payment on reversion to the mean of economic trends…” (Click here to read the full text)6. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Over the past 12 months Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) shares have lost about 45% in value. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is however on the rise recently after a short report by Hindenburg Research failed to prove anything against the company and Block came up with solid rebuttals against the short report. On March 28, DA Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler reaffirmed his Buy rating on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) and called the selloff after the short report a “compelling short-term buying opportunity.” SQ shares got hammered after the broader market downturn in 2022 and the stock could rebound when the market begins to turn the corner.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 70 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Block, Inc.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230416005053/en/""Five-year data demonstrating durability of response is meaningful for oncologists as they consider the most appropriate treatment option for a patient,"" said Johannes Duell, M.D., University Hospital Würzburg Medical Clinic and Polyclinic. ""The prolonged and durable responses seen at five years among relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients in the L-MIND study show that the Monjuvi treatment regimen may have curative potential, which I look forward to seeing explored in future studies.""At the data cut-off (Nov. 14, 2022) for the full analysis set (80 patients), the overall response rate (ORR) was 57.5% (95% CI = 45.9, 68.5), and a complete response (CR) was observed in 41.2% of patients (95% CI = 30.4, 51.6; n = 33). A partial response (PR) was observed in 16.2% of patients (95% CI = 8.9, 26.2; n =13). Additional results include:Median duration of response was not reached after a median follow up of 44.0 months (95% CI = 29.9, 57.0).The median overall survival was 33.5 months (95% CI = 18.3, NR) and median progression-free survival was 11.6 months (95% CI = 5.7, 45.7).Of the 21 patients with &gt;60 months of follow-up, 14 had received one prior line of therapy (pLoT), and seven patients had received ≥2 pLoT.Patients with one pLoT (n = 40) had a higher ORR of 67.5% (CR = 52.5% and PR = 15%) compared to 47.5% of patients with two or more pLoT (n = 40; CR = 30% and PR = 17.5%)Story continuesNo new safety signals were identified. The majority of adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or grade 2 during both combination and monotherapy treatment. Patients experienced a lower frequency of all-grade and grade 3 or higher adverse events during monotherapy. The most common adverse events with combination therapy were neutropenia (incidence per person per year, all-grade/grade ≥3: 3.79/2.09) and thrombocytopenia (1.52/0.52), which declined after patients switched to monotherapy (all-grade/grade ≥3: 1.09/0.70 and 0.17/0.06, respectively, in the first two years of monotherapy). Neutropenia and diarrhea were the most common adverse events in the first two years of monotherapy.""The totality of the long-term L-MIND data presented at AACR further reinforce our confidence that the Monjuvi plus lenalidomide combination remains the in-practice, outpatient, targeted immunotherapy option that can provide sustained remissions for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant,"" said Tim Demuth, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Research and Development Officer, MorphoSys. ""The durable responses and consistent safety profile observed in the five-year analysis are encouraging and further support the use of the Monjuvi regimen as a potentially curative option for appropriate patients.""""The new five-year L-MIND data build on prior analyses that detail the potential for Monjuvi plus lenalidomide to provide long-term, meaningful responses for certain patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, a historically difficult-to-treat form of the disease,"" said Steven Stein, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Incyte. ""We look forward to continuing to explore the potential of Monjuvi to help patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, as well as other CD19-expressing lymphomas.""In July 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Monjuvi in combination with lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma, and who are not eligible for ASCT. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on ORR. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). The U.S. approval is based on an efficacy subgroup of 71 patients confirmed by central lab. The FDA decision represented the first approval of a second-line treatment for adult patients with DLBCL who progressed during or after first-line therapy. Monjuvi, in combination with lenalidomide, was granted accelerated approval based on the one-year primary analysis of the L-MIND study. The data for the five-year analysis of the L-MIND study have not yet been submitted to, or reviewed by, the FDA.About Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)DLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults worldwide1, characterized by rapidly growing masses of malignant B-cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow or other organs. It is an aggressive disease with about 40% of patients not responding to initial therapy or relapsing thereafter2, leading to a high medical need for new, effective therapies2, especially for patients who are not eligible for an autologous stem cell transplant in this setting.About L-MINDThe L-MIND trial was a single arm, open-label Phase 2 study (NCT02399085) investigating the combination of tafasitamab and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who had at least one, but no more than three, prior lines of therapy, including an anti-CD20 targeting therapy (e.g., rituximab), who were not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy or refused subsequent autologous stem cell transplant. The study’s primary endpoint was overall response rate. Secondary outcome measures included duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival. In May 2019, the study reached its primary completion.

In 2010, MorphoSys licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize tafasitamab from Xencor, Inc. Tafasitamab incorporates an XmAb® engineered Fc domain, which mediates B-cell lysis through apoptosis and immune effector mechanism including Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP).In the United States, Monjuvi® (tafasitamab-cxix) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in combination with lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma, and who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).In Europe, Minjuvi® (tafasitamab) received conditional marketing authorization in combination with lenalidomide, followed by Minjuvi monotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).Tafasitamab is being clinically investigated as a therapeutic option in B-cell malignancies in several ongoing combination trials.Monjuvi® and Minjuvi® are registered trademarks of MorphoSys AG.

On April 14, 2023, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) stock closed at $135.85 per share. One-month return of The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) was -2.32%, and its shares gained 23.91% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) has a market capitalization of $79.522 billion.Wedgewood Partners made the following comment about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) also contributed less to performance than most portfolio holdings during the quarter. Progressive reported excellent absolute and relative premium and policies in force (PIF) growth through February. We think much of this has been driven by the Company's highly disciplined approach to policy pricing and is a by-product of years of methodically investing in incremental market segmentation intelligence, most notably telematics. Although Progressive is reaping the relative, competitive rewards of the recent industry pricing volatility, we think the stock currently reflects this reality, and we recently exited our remaining position in the Company. We continue to think Progressive is well run and we will monitor the business and industry, particularly as it relates to balance sheet exposure to the domestic financial services industry.”Story continuesThe Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Industry players like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), Chubb Limited CB, The Progressive Corporation PGR, Everest Re Group RE and Kinsale Capital Group Limited KNSL are poised to grow despite a rise in catastrophic activities. Given an active catastrophe environment, the policy renewal rate should accelerate. Also, the increasing adoption of technology and the emergence of insurtech will help in the smooth functioning of the industry players.Though the industry is witnessing a rate increase, the magnitude has decreased in the last seven quarters. Nonetheless, an improvement in surplus and accelerated economic activities set the stage for a better M&amp;A environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry comprises companies that provide commercial and personal property insurance, and casualty insurance products and services. Such insurance helps to safeguard property in case of any natural or man-made disasters. Liability coverages are also provided by some industry players. The insurance coverage offered also includes automobiles, professional risk, marine, excess casualty, aviation, personal accident, commercial multi-peril, and professional indemnity and surety. Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers. These companies invest a portion of premiums to meet their commitments to policyholders. The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed has already made seven hikes in 2022 and one in 2023 so far. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Property and Casualty Insurance IndustryImproved pricing to help navigate claims: Catastrophes are a concern for insurers due to the high degree of losses incurred. Insurers implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 21 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down over the last eight quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report.Catastrophe loss induces volatility in underwriting profits: The property and casualty insurance industry is susceptible to catastrophe events, which drag down underwriting profit. Catastrophic events weigh on the underwriting profitability of insurers. Aon estimated global economic loss of $313 billion in 2022 from natural disasters while insured losses were estimated to be more than $130 billion. Net underwriting loss increased seven-fold to $26.9 billion in 2022 per a report published in Insurance Journal. Per Verisk and APCIA, the combined ratio deteriorated 310 basis points year over year to 102.7% in 2022. However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the property and casualty industry is likely to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography. Buying businesses along the same lines will also continue as players look to gain market share and grow in their niche areas. With a sturdy capital level, the industry is witnessing a number of mergers, acquisitions and consolidations.Increased adoption of technology: The industry is witnessing increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation that expedite business operations and save cost. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — creating competition for incumbent players. The focus of insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry. Accelerated digitalization has become the need of the hour and insurers continue to invest heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies. As insurtechs use the latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with, there remains a huge market risk. Also, it poses cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects in the near term.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 83% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Valero Energy. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Valero Energy?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Valero Energy. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Valero Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Valero Energy. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 10.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.6% by the third-largest shareholder.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 16 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Valero EnergyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Valero Energy Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$220m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Valero Energy , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

U.S. Republican politicians applauded the move as responsive to their efforts to counter many companies' treatment of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.Galloway said the decision was driven with an eye on the varied views of its largely retail client base. While joining NZAM initially seemed like a good way to encourage companies to disclose more climate data, he said, it proved a poor fit for Vanguard's well-known funds built around indexes not set up to choose among companies like active portfolio managers.Story continues""Those indexes don't have a net-zero objective, so it would be misleading to suggest we were going to do something (on climate) absent action by the individual portfolio companies"" held by the funds, Galloway said.""This was an area of confusion,"" he said.(Reporting by Ross Kerber; editing by Diane Craft)]"

The founder and chairman of the board of Research Affiliates, who pioneered the ‘smart beta’ investing technique, thinks there’s an 80% chance a recession hits the U.S. economy over the next year. What’s more, Arnott knows who is responsible for this state of affairs.“Ultimately, I count myself as a moderate pessimist on our ability to avoid a recession, created as usual by the Fed,” Arnott said. That’s because the Fed did not stave off multiple bank collapses, a consequence of which will be a “credit crunch,” and that in turn, will lead to a recession.However, that’s not to say Arnott thinks there are no opportunities out there right now for investors. While he notes that value stocks have been making a comeback vs. growth since the summer of 2020, he thinks value is only “halfway back to historic norms, which means there’s ample room for value to perform brilliantly in this decade.”With this in mind, we’ve opened the TipRanks database to get the lowdown on two value stocks Wall Street’s stock pros think are ripe for the picking. Both are included in the Vanguard Value ETF, which is the largest value-focused fund, and both are also rated as ‘Strong Buys’ by the analyst consensus. Let’s check the details, then.ConocoPhillips (COP)We’ll start with ConocoPhillips, a global energy industry giant and one of the largest independent exploration and production (E&amp;P) companies in the world, as measured by production levels and proved reserves.The company has operations in 13 countries and its assets are spread over various locations across the globe, although almost half the Texas-based company’s production is derived from US sources. With a market cap of $132 billion, the firm takes the 77th spot on the Fortune 500 list.Like many other crude oil players, ConocoPhillips had a strong 2022. In the most recently reported quarter, 4Q22, net income rose to $3.2 billion, amounting to $2.61 a share, from $2.6 billion or $1.98 per share, in the same period a year ago. Production in the quarter reached 1,758 MBOED (thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day), an uptick of 150 MBOED from 4Q21. And throughout 2022, Conoco attained a record $18.4 billion in FCF with shareholder distributions reaching $15 billion.Story continuesMore recently, the company unveiled a 10-year plan that calls for over $115 billion of free cash flow to be made available for distributions. That’s a huge sum of money and amounts to almost 90% of Conoco’s present market cap.For Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai, the company’s cash returning endeavors are key for the bull-case. She writes: “Using 2022 as a guide, the company’s cash returns are in practice variable in commodity upswings wherein shareholders win alongside cash flows, and are more fixed in commodity downswings. This is only possible given the company’s fortress balance sheet, strong asset base and through the cycle mentality.”“Given its strong target total return of $15bn for this year, which management estimates is ~50% of CFO at $80 Brent, COP is one of the unique names where its FCF yield is average or slightly below average but its payout yield [(base dividend + variable dividend + buyback)/enterprise value] is above average. Numbers still matter, and investors want to get paid to ride out the commodity volatility,” the analyst went on to add.What does this all mean for investors? Wai rates COP shares an Overweight (i.e., Buy) while her $141 price target makes room for one-year returns of 30%. (To watch Wai’s track record, click here)Most on the Street agree with Wai’s take. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 13 Buys vs. 4 Holds. The average target stands at $134.63, implying shares will climb 24% higher in the year ahead. As a bonus, the company pays regular dividends that currently yield 2.14% annually. (See COP stock forecast)UnitedHealth Group (UNH)From one industry giant to another. Boasting a market cap of $477 billion, UnitedHealth is one of the biggest revenue generators in the world. This global mega-cap provides healthcare products and insurance services. Its activities are split into two separate segments: UnitedHealthcare, which offers health insurance, and Optum, which offers data and technology services.The worldwide health insurance industry is seeing robust growth and the stock has reaped the benefits; UNH shares have bettered the S&amp;P 500’s annual performance in all but one of the last 10 years, 2022 included.That said, that has not materialized so far in 2023, as investors reacted negatively to the recently reported Q1 numbers. That might seem weird at first glance, considering the results beat expectations on both the top-and bottom-line. Revenue increased by 14.7% year-over-year to $91.9 billion, trumping Street expectations by $2.12 billion. Adj. EPS of $6.26 came in $0.18 above the $6.08 forecast. As for the outlook, the company raised its adjusted net earnings forecast from the prior range of $24.40-$24.90 to between $24.50 to $25.00 per share. The consensus had previously been at $24.93.Despite increasing its outlook, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill thinks the relatively tame raise is partly to blame for investors’ disappointed reaction.“UNH management was particularly vague on the outlook for its fully capitated care delivery business as a result of the final rate notice and we consider the guidance raise of 10c (in line with the beat) relatively pedestrian by UNH standards,” Hill explained.However, that does little to change Hill’s bullish thesis: “We continue to see the company as a high-quality defensive name in the large-cap healthcare services space given UNH’s increasing diversification into complementary businesses and the continued erosion of regulatory risks, which is reflected in the premium we granted in our target multiple.”To this end, Hill has given UNH a Buy rating and a $627 price target, indicating potential growth of 22.5% over the next year. (To watch Hill’s track record, click here)Overall, UNH has the bulls on its’ side; barring one skeptic, all 8 other recent reviews are positive, providing the healthcare giant with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The analysts see shares rising by 18% in the months ahead, considering the average target clocks in at $605.11.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Tech Stocks to Buy On the Dip.Tech stocks have showed remarkable resilience in 2023 in the face of rising interest rates and an uncertain economic outlook. The tech-heavy NASDAQ index is up over 14% year to date through April 11. But is this rally in tech stocks sustainable? Analysts and investors have sharp differences on the matter but one thing everyone agrees on is that you should buy on company fundamentals and not based on any irrational market assumptions.“Technology is Interesting Again”Recently, billionaire Chase Coleman of Tiger Global recommended big tech stocks as the tiger cub believes “technology is interesting again.”Coleman is bullish on tech due to the rise of new technologies like AI. He referred to the potential benefits of ChatGPT’s integration with Amazon to support the online shopping experience. Taking at an event, Coleman said:“Think about it in terms of companies investing in these technologies, and how well they use it…It’s going to be gradual. Be patient.”Coleman’s confidence comes despite his hedge fund posting huge losses suffered due to the tech rout in 2022.However, some are skeptical of the tech rally.According to a Bloomberg report, Wei Li, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc., said that the tech outperformance this year “is a bit overdone."" Li said that the rally is driven by expectations that the Federal Reserve will start to cut rates.JPMorgan Asset Management Global Market Strategist Meera Pandi agrees with the notion that the Fed’s policy is the ultimate decider of the tech stocks’ trajectory instead of company fundamentals. In an interview with Bloomberg, Pandi said that history shows that market cycles and economic cycles are not in total synchronization and during recessions markets begin to bottom before the worst of the recession is behind us.Story continuesPandi said that tech sector proved to be somewhat defensive in the last recession (she was referring to the pandemic crisis). She believes many of the companies in the tech sector that are taking the lead today are high-quality, blue-chip companies. But the analyst said she is concerned about companies that are overvalued. Another problem Pandi pointed out relates to concentration. The analyst highlighted that the top 10 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index account for about 30% of the index and just 20% of the total profits.While major tech stocks have been gaining value this year, there are a few quality stocks that present an attractive buying opportunity. Amid uncertainty and volatility, those who want to pile into tech stocks should do so based on long-term growth catalysts.Best Tech Stocks to Buy On the DipPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor this article, we first listed down at least 50 notable tech stocks that are down more than 4% over the past six months. We then selected 11 of these stocks with the highest number of hedge fund shareholders.

(NASDAQ:VCSA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13Share Price Decline in the Past Six Months: 71%Shares of vacation rental platform company Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) have lost a whopping 71% over the past six months. Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) has been getting hammered after the company posted its weak Q4 report which shows elevated churn. Oppenheiner analyst Jed Kelly downgraded Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) and said in a note that churn is on a downward trend throughout the industry.Despite huge losses, Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) could be a long-term stock pick for patient investors. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 13 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) was Jim Davidson, Dave Roux and Glenn Hutchins’ Silver Lake Partners which owns a $79 million stake in the company.10. LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Share Price Decline in the Past Six Months: 38%LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) stock has been taking it on the chin since the company posted weak Q4 results. After the earnings report, Credit Suisse’s Fred Lee upgraded LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) to Neutral from Underperform, acknowledging that the company posted “extremely weak results.” The analyst, however, believes LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) is going through a “much-needed restructuring.”LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) recently sold its online psychic reading service Kasamba.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 20 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in LivePerson, Inc.

(NASDAQ:LPSN) was Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP which owns a $71 million stake in the company.Here is what Artisan Small Cap Fund has to say about LivePerson, Inc. (NASDAQ:LPSN) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“LivePerson is a leading provider of mobile and online messaging solutions. We believe customer service and sales centers are shifting from voice to digital communications, and LivePerson is wellequipped to lead this shift. Its LiveEngage cloud-based platform allows brands to engage with customers across digital channels at scale, more efficiently and more effectively. The market opportunity is substantial and goes well beyond digital conversations in service contexts and into areas such as sales, marketing and possibly social media monitoring. A key part of our thesis when we began our investment campaign in 2018 was the arrival of Alex Spinelli as the company’s CTO. Mr. Spinelli came from Amazon, where he was one of the architects and leaders of Alexa. In addition, Mr. Spinelli brought several well-respected technologists to LivePerson with him. Unfortunately, Mr. Spinelli announced his departure from LivePerson in Q3. In addition to this development, our profit cycle thesis has been stalled as the company makes a round of investments into its sales force which will weigh on margins over the near term. We believe Mr. Spinelli’s replacement, Andrew Hamel, carries the credentials to continue leading LivePerson’s technology efforts. Mr. Spinelli worked for Mr. Hamel at Amazon, and the investments in the sales force have the potential to allow the company to scale its business more rapidly. Still, we are in a holding pattern until we gain conviction that the profit cycle we originally invested in can continue to flourish with these changes.”9. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Share Price Decline in the Past Six Months: 5.3%Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

(NASDAQ:UPWK) is one of the leaders in the freelance market, whose value could reach about $12 billion through 2028 according to some estimates. While Upwork Inc.

AppLovin Corporation (NYSE:APP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Share Price Decline in the Past Six Months: 10%AppLovin Corporation (NYSE:APP) in March said that out of the $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents it has, less than $2 million were at the Silicon Valley Bank.In February, AppLovin Corporation (NYSE:APP) posted its Q4 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at -$0.21, missing estimates by $0.26. Revenue in the quarter fell 11.4% to total $702 million, beating estimates by $11.83 million.

AppLovin was a mistake that we were still trading and therefore did not discuss in our second quarter letter. AppLovin owns a portfolio of over 300 mobile games and operates an advertising platform for third party gaming apps. Our investment case hinged on the company’s advertising platform data from the owned games business which we believed was its key competitive advantage. Through our recent research, we concluded that management is likely planning to restructure or sell all or some of the owned games business. In addition, while we thought AppLovin’s second quarter results were good, with revenue up 16%, the company lowered guidance on its long-term organic growth opportunity. To achieve their long-term plans, the company is relying on new initiatives which we would categorize as early stage. As our understanding of a company’s competitive advantage changes, we reevaluate the business to determine how this affects our investment thesis. For AppLovin, we determined that the company’s competitive advantage was not as strong as we once thought, and we followed our discipline by selling AppLovin and redeploying capital into companies that we believe have more stable values and attractive margins of safety.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Tech Stocks to Buy On the Dip. Suggested articles:15 Best Retirement Communities For Active Adults12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Now25 Countries with the Best Hospitals in the WorldDisclosure: None. 11 Best Tech Stocks to Buy On the Dip is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Boring Stocks That Pay Dividends.The 2022 market crash and the broader retreat of growth stocks has established one thing: boring is better when it comes to stock investing during volatile times. The euphoric optimism that started after the pandemic on the back of easy money and sky-high valuations abruptly ended in 2022 with painful losses for growth investors who were betting on exciting, flashy tech companies whose profits lie far into the future. On the other hand, so-called “boring” companies which hardly make daily headlines in stock market news, trade on realistic valuations and generate a lot of cash selling stuff that remains important for people took all the limelight during the year. This value outperformance is expected to continue in 2023 as well as financial markets continue to face the effects of rising inflation, increasing interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty.Earlier this year, Bloomberg quoted Goldman Sachs analyst Peter Oppenheimer, who said that value stocks are expected to outperform growth stocks in 2023 as “big cap technology sees further margin pressure, commodity prices rise and real interest rates remain higher.” Oppenheimer is just one of the many famous investors who were calling for a major tech stocks rout. Morgan Stanley’s famous bear Mike Wilson, who got fame for foreseeing the stock market crash of 2022, also said in March that he was seeing a further 20% downside on some major tech and meme stocks.In January, Wilson said that he was expecting a “nasty earnings recession and the companies that can deliver on cost efficiency will be the ones that can continue to perform.”Which companies can deliver on cost efficiency? You guessed it right. Boring companies that make money. Boring companies with prudent business models, realistic valuations and years of dividend growth will be our focus in this article today because these are the companies that are expected to deliver well despite the financial crunch and recession which could last for months or years to come.Story continuesDuring the start of 2023, the US stock market showed signs of a rebound based on hopes that inflation in the country might be getting under control and the Federal Reserve was on path to pause rate hikes. However, subsequent weeks dashed these hopes as data showed the resilience of the labor market and stubborn inflation. However, an important question to ask is: will value stocks continue to perform well if the stock market starts to rebound in the second half of 2023? Is this the right time to pile into boring value stocks? Last year, Northern Trust published some interesting data points citing Chief Investment Officer for Global Equities Michael Hunstad. These data points may answer this question.Why Should You Invest in Boring Stocks?The Northern Trust  report said that since 1970, there have been six technical recessions in the United States. During six technical recessions in the US since 1970, equity market performance ranged from a 30% decline to a slight increase. However, in the year immediately following these recessions, stock market returns average 22% with value outperforming growth by more than 4% points.In technical recessions coupled with high inflation, value outperformed growth by over 10% points.Here’s what the report added about the expected outperformance of value stocks:“Today's macroeconomic and market picture supports this view. With sustained high inflation, further rate hikes on the horizon, and declining business and consumer sentiment value stocks may have a long runway. And despite recent outperformance, value stocks haven't become overly expensive, adding credence to a continued value tilt.”Boring Stocks that Pay DividendsWhy Dividend Stocks?While value stocks shined in 2022, what took the most of the limelight last year were not-so-boring dividend stocks. Dividend stocks provided a safe haven to investors who were looking for a refuge amid a ruthless economic turmoil. Dividend stocks in 2022 made history and cemented the already-studied phenomenon which says dividend stocks perform better during recessionary periods and high inflation. Earlier this year,  Alec Young, MAPsignal's Chief Investment Strategist, gave an interview to BNNBloomberg about dividend stocks and their performance during inflationary periods. Young said that dividends account for about 40% of the total stock market returns over the long run.Young said that his firm dug some data and found that dividend stocks do “best when inflation is high like it is now.” Young said that when CPI inflation in the US is between 6% and 7%, dividend stocks outperform non-dividend paying stocks by the widest margins of any other type of inflation environment that we looked at.Young added that this dividend stocks outperformance was across the board and wasn’t peculiar to say high-yield dividend stocks or dividend growth stocks. He said that dividend stocks fell by mid-single digits in 2022 as compared to the 19% decline for the S&amp;P 500. He was expecting this outperformance to continue in 2023.""Companies that Make Real Things and Do Real Things""At the core of any investment thesis propending to buy boring stocks is the rationale that companies that make essential items that sell irrespective of the economic cycle are positioned well to weather any economic storm. As Jim Cramer, probably one of the least boring personalities in the stock investing space, said in a program last year:“If you took your cue from me and bought common stocks of companies that make real things and do real things that return capital and trade at a reasonable valuation, you’re relatively fine.”Cramer also identified the “problem” with these boring yet solid companies:“The problem is those stocks that go down less … they’re really boring.”Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings and picked top 11 boring companies — companies that aren’t much sexy, have dull but solid, top-selling products and services — that pay dividends.Boring Stocks That Pay Dividends11.

In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: aflibercept 8 mg every 12 weeks, aflibercept 8 mg every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks. The lead sponsors of the trials were Bayer for PULSAR and Regeneron for PHOTON.Patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 5 initial monthly doses in PHOTON and 3 in PULSAR. In the first year, patients in the aflibercept 8 mg groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study, with those results still to be assessed. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.CANDELA was a Phase 2 trial investigating the safety and efficacy of aflibercept 8 mg extended dosing regimens compared to EYLEA in wAMD patients.About wAMD and DMEwAMD is a retinal disease that may affect people as they age. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow and leak fluid under the macula, the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision and seeing fine detail. This fluid can damage and scar the macula, which can cause vision loss. An estimated 1.1 million Americans have wAMD, and this number is expected to double by 2050.DME is a common complication in eyes of people living with diabetes. DME occurs when high levels of blood sugar lead to damaged blood vessels in the eye that leak fluid into the macula. This can lead to vision loss and, in some cases, blindness. Of the nearly 28 million American adults living with diabetes, an estimated 1.2 million have DME.About EYLEAEYLEA is a VEGF inhibitor formulated as an injection for the eye. It is designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels (vascular permeability) in the eye by blocking VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PLGF), two growth factors involved in ocular angiogenesis. The EYLEA safety and efficacy profile is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, more than 11 years of real-world experience and greater than 57 million EYLEA injections globally.IMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONSINDICATIONSEYLEA (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) (0.4 mg [0.01 mL]).CONTRAINDICATIONSEYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSIntravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.In infants with ROP, reactivation of abnormal angiogenesis and tortuosity may occur following treatment with EYLEA. Infants should be monitored closely after injection with EYLEA until retinal vascularization has completed or until the examiner is assured that reactivation of ROP will not occur. Treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring and additional EYLEA injections and/or laser treatments may be necessary.There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.ADVERSE REACTIONSSerious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.In pre-term infants with ROP receiving EYLEA the most common adverse reactions (≥4%) reported were retinal detachment, conjunctival hemorrhage, and intraocular pressure increased. Adverse reactions established for adult indications are considered applicable to pre-term infants with ROP, though not all were observed in the clinical studies.Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.For more information, please see full Prescribing Information.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Chico is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Fort Worth.A locomotive engineer and conductor were being treated for injuries after the southbound train derailed following the accident. No one else was on board the freight train, South said.The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a safety investigative team to look into the derailment.One of the injured employees was transported to a hospital by helicopter and the other was taken by ambulance to Wise Health System in Decatur, Texas, the Wise County Emergency Operations Center said in a statement.Three locomotives and about 15 grain cars derailed, but the train was not carrying any hazardous materials, South said.The accident comes amid heightened attention to rail safety nationwide following a fiery derailment in February in Ohio and a string of derailments since then that have been grabbing headlines. The U.S. averages about three train derailments per day, according to federal data, but relatively few create disasters.In Texas, asked about the speed of the train when Sunday's collision occurred, South said Union Pacific was investigating the cause of the accident and no other information was available at the time.]"
