Walmart execs are preparing.CFO John David Rainey called the practice ""part of our normal planning process"" in a Q&amp;A during the shareholder's meeting, saying, ""We consider a range of possibilities, economic environment.""""We want to make sure that we are addressing not only the need to maximize revenue and profits but also looking at our balance sheet as well, making sure that we have access to capital at the lowest possible cost, which we did when we entered the market earlier this year,"" he added.Why the concern? ""Consumer wallets are squeezed and that's affecting...what they're purchasing,"" said Rainey.Price-cutting: CEO Doug McMillon told shareholders that some relief may be on the way for its customers. To keep ahead of the competition, Walmart aims to cut prices in an environment where mega companies have been accused of over-charging to jack up profits.Said the CEO: Walmart is ""trying to work hard right now, as we have been for quite some time now, with our suppliers to get our prices down."" McMillon was bullish, though: ""We think the company's positioned to succeed regardless of the environment.""So far so good. Compared to a year ago, Walmart stock is up more than 14%.Customer obsessed, tech obsessed: ""At the end of it, all, we are a tech company, but we are not a traditional tech company. We are here to solve real problems for real people,"" said Anshu Bhardwaj, Walmart's senior vice president of technology strategy and commercialization.AI, or artificial intelligence, is a big area of emphasis — and investment. Walmart, for instance, is testing a conversation platform, nicknamed ""Converse,"" to answer product-related questions on its website. In other words, a ""dedicated shopping assistant.""Story continuesFor example, a shopper can say, ""I'm interested in looking for a cell phone for a 10-year-old,"" then chatGPT will unveil four criteria when buying a cell phone for a 10-year-old, such as safety and parental controls. Then, once the shopper places the phone in its basket, the shopping assistant will ask if they also want a durable case.Converse was introduced back in 2020, but the world is more aware of it now thanks to ChatGPT, which Cheryl Ainoa, Walmart's EVP of new businesses and emerging tech, called a ""tipping point."" She added: ""The reason is it brought the ability to engage with the AI to anybody. You don't have to have a data science degree.""Bhardwaj said the question employees are asking is, ""How can I make my job easier [with AI] and apply that across the entire company?""Walmart's wholesale retailer Sam's Club uses the Converse tool for its AI digital assistant, ""Ask Sam,"" which allows employees to ask questions and translate languages, among other tools.No dice: There were nine shareholder proposals — they all failed. The proposals ranged from a ""Communist China Risk Audit"" and limiting contributions made by Walmart's PAC to requesting a ""Racial and Gender Layoff Diversity Report.""Walmart Executives Anshu Bhardwaj, Walmart's VP, Technology Strategy &amp; Commercialization (left) and Cheryl Ainoa, New Businesses and Emerging Tech EVP (right) break down how the company is using AI on the Walmart website. (Photo: Brooke DiPalma/Yahoo Finance)Eyebrow-raising raises: The company's roughly 3,700 pharmacists will now have an average annual salary of $140,000 or so. This is on top of raises that took place last year. Based on Indeed data, the current professional average is approximately $118,081 per year. Walmart also raised pay for more than 4,000 opticians, with expectations for the average wage to be $22.50 an hour. No additional details were provided.Health: Walmart is heavily investing in its Health and Wellness business. By the end of 2024, Walmart will have more than 75 health centers in the US in states including Texas, Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, and Florida.Walmart introduced new packaging, moving away from plastic mailers as it boosts itself as an omnichannel network.

(Photo taken by Brooke DiPalma/Yahoo Finance)Going greener: Walmart is moving from plastic to recyclable paper mailers and using technology to get the size of cardboard packaging right. It is also giving customers the option to opt out of bags for pickup orders and the option to consolidate shipping orders, as Amazon (AMZN) does. However, unlike Amazon, there are no incentives, like credits, to encourage customers to make the ""sustainable"" choice.As a result of the switch, Walmart will eliminate over 2,000 tons of secondary plastic packaging and 65 million plastic bag mailers once the switch rolls out through the end of this fiscal year. The right size packaging is also expected to allow the company to put more boxes in trucks and thus reduce miles for shipping.Star-studded lineup: On Friday, Walmart wowed the crowd of shareholders and associates from Sam's Club, Walmart US, and Walmart International, including employees from China for the first time in four years, with quite a few A-list celebrities. Shania Twain kicked off the associate celebration, followed by host Kevin Hart. Other performers included John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Rachel Platten, and Pitbull.

This takes the annual payment to 1.5% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, Walmart's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 79.0%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 31% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.88 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.28. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 1.9% a year over that time. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive.We Could See Walmart's Dividend GrowingSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Walmart has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.8% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.Walmart Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Walmart is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Walmart that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

There are concerns about economic weakness in the U.S. and Europe, while China’s rebound from COVID-19 restrictions has been less robust than many had hoped.Saudi Arabia, the dominant producer in the OPEC oil cartel, was one of several members that agreed on a surprise cut of 1.6 million barrels per day in April. The kingdom’s share was 500,000. That followed OPEC+ announcing in October that it would slash 2 million barrels per day, angering U.S. President Joe Biden by threatening higher gasoline prices a month before the midterm elections.Story continuesAll told, OPEC+ has now dropped production on paper by 4.6 million barrels a day. But some countries can't produce their quotas, so the actual reduction is around 3.5 million barrels per day, or over 3% of global supply.The previous cuts gave little lasting boost to oil prices. International benchmark Brent crude climbed as high as $87 per barrel but has given up its post-cut gains and been loitering below $75 per barrel in recent days. U.S. crude has recently dipped below $70.That has helped U.S. drivers kicking off the summer travel season, with prices at the pump averaging $3.55, down $1.02 from a year ago, according to auto club AAA. Falling energy prices also helped inflation in the 20 European countries that use the euro drop to the lowest level since before Russia invaded Ukraine.The Saudis need sustained high oil revenue to fund ambitious development projects aimed at diversifying the country’s economy.The International Monetary Fund estimates the kingdom needs $80.90 per barrel to meet its envisioned spending commitments, which include a planned $500 billion futuristic desert city project called Neom.The U.S. recently announced oil purchases to replenish its Strategic Petroleum Reserve — after Biden announced the largest release from the reserve in American history last year — in an indicator that U.S. officials may be less worried about OPEC cuts than in months past.While oil producers like Saudi Arabia need revenue to fund their state budgets, they also have to take into account the impact of higher prices on oil-consuming countries.Oil prices that go too high can fuel inflation, sapping consumer purchasing power and pushing central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve toward further interest rate hikes that can slow economic growth.The Saudi production cut and any increase to oil prices could add to the profits that are helping Russia pay for its war against Ukraine. Russia has found new oil customers in India, China and Turkey amid Western sanctions designed to limit Moscow’s crucial energy income.However, higher crude prices risk complicating trade by the world’s No. 3 oil producer if they exceed the $60-per-barrel price cap imposed by the Group of Seven major democracies.Russia has found ways to evade the price cap through “dark fleet” tankers, which tamper with location data or transfer oil from ship to ship to disguise its origin. But those efforts add costs.Under the OPEC+ deal, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow will extend its voluntary cut of 500,000 barrels a day through next year, according to Russian state news agency Tass.But Russia might not be following through on its promises. Moscow’s total exports of oil and refined products such as diesel fuel rose in April to a post-invasion high of 8.3 million barrels per day, the International Energy Agency said in its April oil market report.___AP reporter Fatima Hussein contributed from Washington.___This story was first published on June 4, 2023. It was updated on June 6, 2023, to correct that the U.S. has recently announced it will purchase oil as it works to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, not that it has already replenished the reserve.]"

But it has become a microcosm of the wider issues at stake.The scheme is described as either reckless or vital – depending on who you ask.If approved, the field would begin production in late 2026 and continue through 2050. At its peak, it would supply around 70,000 barrels of oil per day – or 8pc of the UK’s total needs – and 60 million cubic feet of gas per day.Equinor expects Rosebank to add £24bn to the UK economy and create 1,200 UK jobs at its peak, including 255 permanent positions with the company.However, climate campaigners say the project breaches UK net-zero targets, will do little for household energy bills or energy security because 80pc of its production will go to refineries abroad, and will require huge public subsidies.“If we want a liveable climate, we can’t allow any new oil and gas projects or licences,” the group Stop Rosebank says.Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow energy secretary and a former party leader, has publicly opposed all new development for similar reasons.Story continuesInstead of drilling new oil and gas wells, Labour sources say, the UK should make “the most efficient use” of its existing reserves.At the same time, Labour has vowed to borrow £28bn per year to plough into renewable energy schemes such as wind and solar farms, which it says will generate tens of thousands of jobs.Sir Keir Starmer has often criticised Margaret Thatcher’s “callous” decision to shut dozens of British coal mines during the 1980s, which he blames for the economic malaise in former pit towns.The Labour leader claims he will not repeat the same mistake twice and will preserve jobs in the North Sea oil and gas industry as the country switches to renewable energy.“There are many people in well-paid, secure jobs in oil and gas who are anxious about what happens if we transition,” he told business leaders at a British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference last month.“The worst thing we can do is not take this seriously. The worst thing you can do is not engage with them, [not] have a plan which everybody has confidence in and do what happened at the end of coal mining, which was to essentially say to people ‘I’m sorry... we’re moving on, you’d better get on your bike’.“The effects of that are still felt in communities across the country and never, ever again must we make that mistake.”Yet Equinor and industry representatives say investment in renewable energy will not be enough to meet Britain’s immediate energy needs.They insist that Rosebank and schemes like it are accounted for in Britain’s “carbon budget” and will make a vital contribution towards British and European energy security in the wake of the Ukraine war.And while much of the oil produced will go to the Continent, it is then sent back to Britain in refined form.Domestic production is particularly important to the UK, industry bosses argue, because the UK still depends on fossil fuels for three-quarters of its energy needs. It produces roughly half of its oil and gas supplies domestically.The North Sea is already in natural decline, with its remaining reserves becoming harder and more expensive to extract.Meanwhile the share of fossil fuels in the energy mix is falling gradually, meaning we will need to import more over the coming years to meet demand.New wells are therefore needed to keep the oil flowing and prevent Britain becoming ever more dependent on imports, argues David Whitehouse, chief executive of lobby group Offshore Energies UK.“While we still use oil and gas in the UK, every barrel we choose not to produce here in the UK will simply come from somewhere else,” he adds.“That means we will be exporting our jobs. It means we’re importing oil and gas from other countries which do not have that same commitment to climate change that we have.“So from my perspective, it is absolutely consistent with the IEA [recommendations] that we continue to develop domestic oil and gas.”He says UK producers are already taking bigger steps than their global counterparts to cut the emissions from extraction.For example, at Rosebank Equinor has vowed to use a floating production vessel that can eventually be fully electrified – meaning it could be powered by wind energy.“This is a sector which is absolutely looking to make sure ours is the cleanest oil produced globally,” Whitehouse adds.“There’s a huge amount of effort going on with the industry to deliver on that.”The North Sea Transition Deal announced by the Government in 2021 aims to strike a balance, by helping the industry cut emissions while gradually retraining staff for jobs in green energy.However, Offshore Energies UK has predicted that a blanket ban on all new oil and gas development would send North Sea oil production plummeting by 60pc by 2033, costing the industry at least 45,000 jobs.It has put Sir Keir under pressure to explain how Labour’s reported proposal will not lead to a jobs bloodbath, with the party’s union backers among those publicly expressing concerns.Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, which represents oil rig workers, says the Labour leader’s proposals so far lack vital details.“We cannot have a repeat of the devastation wrought on workers and their communities by the closure of the coal mines,” she said this week.As a decision on Rosebank approaches, Sir Keir will be forced to choose a side.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

It would undermine the UK energy security, it would undermine those 200,000 jobs that we see across the country, it would make the country poorer.“And I think, very importantly, it’s worth pointing out that it would also take away the investment that we need for the journey to net zero, because it would undermine those supply chain companies that actually need the oil and gas work in order for them to be able to invest in the longer-term journey to net zero and the technologies we will need.“There will be opportunities in the future with these new technologies. But our argument is that those jobs do not exist today – so if you undermine the sector today, you lose those jobs.”The group estimates that 45,000 jobs will be lost by the end of this decade if new investment in oil and gas is banned in the UK Continental Shelf.At the same time, it points to official forecasts by the Government and the North Sea Transition Authority that suggest that a block on investment would mean the UK’s dependence on oil and gas imports would rise from 50pc today to 80pc by 2033.If new investment is allowed, this dependence would only rise to 60pc.It means that a ban on new investment would equate to a 60pc drop in production compared to current levels, Offshore Energies UK said. That compares to a 20pc drop under a “business as usual” scenario as yields from the North Sea naturally decline.Story continuesSir Keir will announce a ban on new oil and gas licences later this month, the Sunday Times reported.However, the proposal has already been attacked by Labour’s biggest union donor, Unite, which warned that the party risked triggering a jobs bloodbath comparable to that caused by the rapid closure of Britain’s coal mines in the 1980s.Sharon Graham, the union’s general secretary said: “When Keir Starmer decided to let the world know that he would halt new oil and gas production in the North Sea he left out everything that was important – the detail.“Labour must now be very clear that they will not let workers pay the price for the transition to renewable energy. When it comes to jobs we can’t have jam tomorrow.”A Labour source insisted that granting new oil and gas licences will do nothing to cut bills and “drive a coach and horse through our climate targets”.The source said the party advocates managing existing oil and gas wells “in the most efficient way possible” to continue production, while investing in new renewable capacity.Conservative cabinet minister Grant Shapps, the Energy Security Secretary, has branded Labour’s proposal “crazy”.He said that making Britain more reliant on energy imports would open the door “to tyrants like Putin to use energy as a weapon to blackmail our country”.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

9,27561ed1-526d-393e-9578-b5a02477e2b8,O,2023-06-04,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-055217963.html,1685857937,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F', 'GC=F']","[Investing.com - By the time you read this, OPEC would have probably decided, even announced, new production levels meant to seize pricing of oil back from the hands of short-sellers who’ve driven the group nuts this year in trying to keep a barrel at $80 or more.Oil revenue is the lifeblood of the economies in OPEC, or the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, a 13-member Saudi-led group whose main objective is to be the price-setter of the commodity. Ten other oil-producing states, including Russia, that aren’t OPEC members also keep their output closely in line with the group’s for the sake of price. The 23-nation alliance is collectively known as OPEC+.For Saudi Arabia, oil accounts for 70% of total export value and 53% of government revenue; for the United Arab Emirates, it’s 13% of exports and 30% of GDP and for Algeria, it’s 25% of GDP. But for Kuwait and Iraq, more than 90% of all revenue depends on oil.Thus, it’s easy to see why OPEC+ would go to any extent to get the prices it wants for its oil.The alliance typically deprives the market of millions of barrels of crude oil per day - under the name of production cuts - to create an artificial supply squeeze that pushes prices higher.In recent years, the group, or specifically Saudi Arabia’s energy minister who came on board in 2019, has even taken to warning oil traders not to bet on lower prices unless they want to be “ouching” - and proved this by announcing deep and unexpected output cuts that sent the market rallying, to the detriment of short-sellers.This week, OPEC upped the ante for unconventional behavior by blocking three of the world’s largest media outfits - Reuters, Bloomberg and Wall Street Journal - from its production policy meetings held at the secretariat of its headquarters in Vienna. No reasons were given for the selective media blockade, which appeared triggered by OPEC’s displeasure over the three media outfits’ reporting of its activities, which included a story about growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Russia over a discord on production levels.Story continuesAt the time of writing, it was not known yet what OPEC had decided as appropriate production going forth. In October and April, the group announced deep and surprise cuts of 2 million barrels per day and 1.7 million barrels per day, respectively. Both announcements provided only brief support for prices, with a barrel of U.S. crude repeatedly falling below $70 since March and global crude benchmark Brent staying beneath $80 despite the well-known Saudi desire for prices to be nearer to $90.Energy Intelligence, one of the publications covering the meeting, said it had been informed that OPEC would need to generate a positive price reaction for oil when trading begins on Monday with its production decision that should “have an immediate impact on the availability of oil in the global market”.Any OPEC-plus decision will be delivered with a healthy dose of rhetoric about the group’s compliance with existing cuts, people close to the matter told Energy Intelligence.Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 that practically destroyed demand for oil for a while, OPEC has harped on quota compliance as data showing adherence of above 100% to cuts supported U.S. crude’s rebound from a pandemic low of minus $40 per barrel to above $88 by January last year. The Ukraine invasion by Russia then pushed a barrel to 14-year highs of above $130 a barrel. From there, a cocktail of slowing oil demand in top buyer China, global economic worries and a banking crisis in the United States have repeatedly sent oil lower despite OPEC’s best attempts.While OPEC loves to talk about closeness in its ranks - UAE Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei painted a picture of solidarity ahead of Sunday’s meeting, saying “this group is solid” or that any cuts agreed upon will be carried out in full - the reality offers a different picture.For months now, Russia has repeatedly exceeded its so-called OPEC+ production quota while selling a barrel without much concern at $60 or around that, under prices ordained by the G7’s sanctions.Currently, Russian production is in the global spotlight, following its pledge to cut 500,000 barrels per day from its February levels and officials there have gone out of their way to demonstrate commitment to achieving compliance with the full pledge.Energy Intelligence said its own assessments show Russian production down about 300,000 barrels daily in April. “Sources and certain market data point to the potential that Russia further decreased production in May, which would be welcome news to fellow members,” the publication reported. Other media reports, meanwhile, suggest that Russian crude exports hit pre-sanction highs in May.Whatever you have as the new OPEC decision on production - whether a rollover of existing output levels, or an immediate cut of another million barrels that could take the total artificial squeeze on the market to nearly 5 million barrels per day - it is designed to show the group is in full control of the market.With summer demand for oil looking poised to grow in the coming two months, OPEC may be at its best moment yet to tilt the market its way. Yet, some of the best-laid plans in history have also fallen apart for the most unexpected of reasons. We shall see how well this one works out for OPEC.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude did a final post-settlement trade of $71.87 per barrel after officially settling Friday’s session at $71.74 - up $1.64, or 2.3%, on the day. For the week, WTI was down 1.3%. On Wednesday, the U.S. crude benchmark hit a four-week low of $67.03.London-traded Brent crude did a final post-settlement trade of $76.40 per barrel after officially settling Friday’s session at $76.13, up $1.85, or 2.5%. For the week, Brent was down 1%. The global benchmark for oil hit a four-week low of $71.39 on Wednesday.Oil: WTI Technical OutlookBarring any OPEC-inspired action, WTI’s immediate resistance to break in the week ahead would be the 5-week Exponential Moving Average of $72.50, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“This level needs to be cleared for further upside towards the swing high of $73.55, above which sits the next leg higher, where the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $75.50 will serve as the next challenge,” said Dixit.On the flip, the 200-week Simple Moving Average, or SMA, of $67.10 will be the low target for market bears to crack, he said.“A sustained break below this zone will eventually extend the decline towards the major downside target, where the 100-month SMA of $59.60 sits.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity Natural gas futures limped in with a daily gain and a small weekly loss on Friday as market participants banking on near-term demand looked beyond the first injection of above 100 billion cubic feet, or bcf, in the current storage season for the fuel.The front-month gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade at $2.177 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units, after officially settling Friday’s session at $2.172 - up 0.6% on the day. It was the first daily gain for the benchmark gas futures contract after four straight days of losses.For the week, the contract finished down 0.4%, adding to the 15.6% plunge in the prior week.“The second half of June into early July suggests that consistent heat isn’t too far off into the future and once that heat materializes demand will rebound.”The market appears to be starting to price this in and further bullish support may materialize.The rebound came after the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reported in its roundup of gas storage for the week ended May 26 that U.S. inventories of the fuel rose by 110 bcf last week.That compared with the 96-bcf injection seen in the prior week to May 19. It also contrasted against the 82-bcf injection seen during the same week a year ago and the five-year (2018-2022) average build of 101 bcf.With the latest stockpile increase, the EIA reported that total gas in underground caverns in the United States stood at 2.446 trillion cubic feet, or tcf — up 29.5% from the year-ago level of 1.889 tcf and 16.6% higher than the five-year average of 2.097 tcf.Just two weeks ago, Henry Hub’s benchmark gas contract hovered at 11-week highs of around $2.70, breaking out from the tight confines of mid-$2 pricing on the notion that the market may finally be turning the corner on fundamentals despite its oversupplied state. But in recent days, it fell back to under $2.50, which has proven again to be a formidable barrier for gas bulls.Natural gas: Henry Hub Technical OutlookGoing into the week ahead, the price level of $2.09 offers immediate support for natural gas, with the next leg lower being $2.03 and $1.94, said SKCharting’s Dixit.“Consolidation above the 100-day SMA of $2.47 is essential for a resumption of an uptrend that would target the swing high of $2.68 and $2.98, followed by the 100-month SMA of $3.24.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity The U.S. debt ceiling deal is done but gold isn’t quite dead yet, as some had been speculating.Futures of the yellow metal settled down on Friday for the first time in three days. But the drop could not wipe gains over the three previous days, leaving gold in the positive for the week.The front-month gold contract on New York’s Comex officially settled at $1,947.40 an ounce, down $30.60, or 1.5%, on the day. The final post-settlement trade was $1,952.40.The benchmark for gold futures hit a two-week high of $2,000.65 in the previous session. For the week, Comex’s front-month gold contract posted a return of 1.3%.The spot price of gold, which reflects physical trades in bullion and is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,948.46 down $29.06, or 1.5%. Spot gold hit a one-week high of $1,983.44 on Friday before reversing.Gold had a positive week despite the dollar rising for a second time in three sessions as forex traders reacted to the Senate passage for the debt ceiling deal that only needs President Joe Biden’s signature next.U.S. jobs data for May also proved stronger than expected while unemployment itself rose and wage growth slowed, resulting in a split opinion among economists on whether policy makers at the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates again when they meet on June 14.Gold: Spot Price Outlook Spot gold’s initial recovery from $1,932 scaled up to $1983, slightly above the Daily middle Bollinger Band dynamically positioned at $1980 failed to hold above the zone, and the strong jobs report pushed the metal below $1,975 support reaching $1,947.As long as gold sustains above the $1,945-$1,942 horizontal support zone, a rebound towards $1,960 may be witnessed, SKCharting’s Dixit said.“Strong consolidation above $1,960 would be needed to attract buyers for a retest of $1,975,” said the technical chartist.“Stability below $1,960 and a sustained break below the $1,945-$1,942 horizontal support zone will call for a further drop to the $1,932-$1,926, followed by deeper correction into the $1,913-$1,910 area.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOPEC+ begins meetings that may agree further output cuts - sourcesMexico to fight US dispute over GM corn after formal consultations fail]"

(NYSE:OMC) Will Be Trading Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/just-four-days-till-omnicom-120449154.html,1685793889,STORY,['OMC'],"[It looks like Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Omnicom Group's shares on or after the 8th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 7th of July.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.70 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.80 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Omnicom Group has a trailing yield of 3.1% on the current share price of $91.32. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Omnicom Group paid out a comfortable 42% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Omnicom Group generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 66% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Omnicom Group earnings per share are up 8.0% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Omnicom Group has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Omnicom Group has increased its dividend at approximately 8.8% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayIs Omnicom Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have been growing at a steady rate, and Omnicom Group paid out less than half its profits and more than half its free cash flow as dividends over the last year. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.In light of that, while Omnicom Group has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Omnicom Group (1 shouldn't be ignored) you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Never miss another market-moving alert.Soft guidance at SalesforceSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) shares slumped 4.7% on Thursday even after the company reported better-than-expected earnings.Analysts say the stock sold off because Salesforce revenue outperformance was below historical trends, and it also missed on under-contract sales expected in the next 12 months (that is, cRPO, or current revenue performance obligation). Moreover, its revenue growth for the quarter came in at its slowest pace since 2010, per Reuters.For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.69, $0.08 better than the average analyst estimate, and $8.25 billion in sales was ahead of the $8.18B consensus. Next quarter Salesforce expects sales of $8.51B to $8.53B, higher than the $8.49B estimates.Despite the market's reaction, Goldman Sachs reiterated its Buy rating on CRM shares, saying the results were ""strong in light of the challenging macro backdrop.""Bank of America reaffirmed a Top Pick status on CRM, noting it is ""impressed"" by the 1% guidance beat for cRPO growth ""given the tough macro and disruption from restructuring actions.""Shares closed the week at $213.03.Broadcom's better-than-expected printOn Thursday, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) said it recorded earnings of $10.32 per share, easily beating the $10.12 consensus, on slightly better-than-expected revenue of $8.73B. It expects $8.85B in sales for the third quarter, comfortably above estimates for $8.72B.Goldman Sachs said the company delivered ""another solid quarter,"" citing its expectations for that generative artificial intelligence ""has the potential to support a 'soft-landing' in the near term and drive above-model growth in the medium- to long-term.""Story continuesSimilarly, BofA argues that Broadcom's AI portfolio is ""underappreciated,"" and assigned the stock a new Street-high price target of $950.Shares dipped in the premarket on Friday, but ultimately closed the regular session up 2.5%. Shares ended the week at $812 even.HP sees weakness in PC demandHP (NYSE:HPQ) shares slid some 6% Wednesday after the PC maker posted its lowest revenue for a quarter since early 2020, noting ongoing weakness in demand for personal computers.For the fiscal second quarter ended in April, HP reported a 21.7% drop in overall revenue to $12.9B - below expectations for $13.1B - encompassing a 29% slide in PC business sales and a 5% dip in printing revenue.Adjusted earnings per share of $0.80 beat expectations for $0.76. Third-quarter (ending July) guidance calls for adjusted earnings of $0.81 to $0.91 a share vs. the $0.85 consensus, and it expects $3.30 to $3.50 for the full year, up from a prior analysts' estimate of $3.34.BofA reiterated its Underperform rating on the company, saying it remains cautious on HPQ shares even though guidance implies a second-half sales recovery: ""We expect margins to normalize lower, and estimates to be revised lower over the next couple of qtrs.""Barclays said the guidance may prove to be ""aggressive,"" adding, ""We continue to see downside for shares with near term top-line, margin and cash flow pressures, though cost cuts help offset some of the underlying weaknesses.""HP shares staged a partial recovery to end the week, rising 3.8% to $30.55.Dell throttles estimates amid challenging macro environmentOn Thursday Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) said adjusted EPS totaled $1.31, smashing the $0.86 average Street estimate, on better-than-expected revenue of $20.9B.The beat on the bottom line comes even as margins and revenue fell amid a weaker backdrop for PC demand, and Dell guided for Q2 revenue of $20.7B at the midpoint of the range - worse than the Street at $21.1B.Dell's client solutions group and infrastructure solutions group business saw revenue fall 23% and 18% respectively amid ""challenging economic backdrop,"" the company said.The stock saw a premarket slump before climbing 4% in Friday's regular session.Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank each kept their buy ratings on the stock, although the former highlighted a weak recovery in Dell's core PC business.Deutsche said it believes ""the risk-reward is attractive"" for the stock, noting, ""Considering a tough macro environment suggested by other IT hardware peers, we are not too surprised by DELL's cautious comments in the near term, and we view a delayed recovery as reasonable.""Amazon denies report it is setting its sights on telecom spaceAn Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) spokesperson said the company doesn't have plans to add wireless services at this time, Reuters reported, following a Bloomberg story that said Amazon is in talks to offer low-cost or free nationwide mobile phone service to Prime subscribers - news that shook the shares of telecom companies.""We are always exploring adding even more benefits for Prime members, but don't have plans to add wireless at this time,"" the spokesperson said, according to Reuters, while AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile ""denied any talks.""Amazon stock had gotten a lift on the initial report, while telecom companies like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), AT&amp;T Inc (NYSE:T), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) took sharp slides.On the other hand, shares in DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) gained as much as 8.3% on the report. The satellite services provider is already working with Amazon and is expected to start selling its wireless services on Amazon in July.Senad Karaahmetovic, Liz Moyer, Yasin Ebrahim, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.Related ArticlesThis week in tech: Salesforce slowdown; Amazon denies plans to disrupt telecom4 big deal reports: 3D Systems' rival offer for StratasysElon Muskâs trip to China: This week in EVs]"

Hunt previously criticized the CMA’s veto, telling a business conference recently that competition watchdogs must “understand their wider responsibilities.”Despite Hunt’s comments, one of the people said government ministers were “unhappy” with some of Smith’s criticism of the CMA in interviews in which he claimed that the European Union — which approved the takeover — was a better place to do business than the UK. The government holds no formal role in the enforcement of the country’s competition rules, but members of the CMA board are appointed by the UK’s business department.Story continuesSmith will also sit down with Microsoft’s legal representatives to discuss the firm’s strategy to counter the CMA decision, laying out a series of options that the company could take to save the deal.Read More: Microsoft Gets Date Boost in Appeal of $69 Billion Deal BanOne extreme option could be to bypass the UK order and press ahead with the deal, or withdraw Activision from the UK market, one of the people said, confirming earlier reports by regulatory news outfit Mlex.The company is also likely to draw on the EU’s findings in its legal arguments against the CMA, after EU merger officials conditionally approved the record-breaking gaming merger last month.The Chancellor’s office declined to comment. Activision didn’t respond to a request for comment. The confidential discussions will take place as Smith takes part in London Tech Week, an event aimed at boosting the UK’s technology industry.While the CMA said the merger would reinforce Microsoft’s advantage in the cloud gaming market, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager called it “pro-competitive” and said that it could “kick-start” the cloud streaming market.Following the regulator’s block, Microsoft appealed to the UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Oil Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.According to Deloitte, the global oil and gas sector entered 2023 with a strong balance sheet position and a controlled capital spending strategy. The London, UK-based professional services firm supported this claim with the fact that 93% of the executives surveyed in the oil and gas sector reported having a positive outlook on the sector in 2023. They believe that the healthy balance sheet positions could aid their organizations in covering up for the deficit in investment in recent years and play an important role in accelerating the transition towards green energy. The healthy state of the oil and gas exploration and production (E&amp;P) industry is also supported by the fact that the industry generated record free cash flows (FCF) of $1.4 trillion in 2022. Experts are now closely examining how upstream companies will utilize their resources to enhance shareholder value. The focus lies on two main avenues: boosting shareholder payouts through dividends and share buybacks and exploring opportunities for reinvestment and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity. According to Wood Mackenzie, the oil and gas E&amp;P industry is expected to allocate a capital outlay of $470 billion in 2023 to uplift the sector amidst challenging economic circumstances.Despite the possibility of a global recession, crude oil prices have been able to maintain ground. This can be attributed to the significant production cuts made by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) along with Russia and other allies in the recent past. In April, the group revealed a 1.16 million barrels per day (bpd) cut in production. As per estimates by Reuters, OPEC+ has managed to cut global crude oil production by 3.66 million bpd, which is equivalent to 3.7% of the global demand. Currently, crude oil prices are hovering around the $70 level as opposed to a peak of $139 in March 2022. The head of investment firm Pickering Energy Partners thinks that the recent production cuts implemented by OPEC+ could potentially lead to a $10 increase in oil prices per barrel.Story continuesGoldman Sachs' Price Forecasts Following the production cut in April, Goldman Sachs increased its December 2023 price forecast for Brent crude oil by $5 to $95 per barrel. Furthermore, the Brent crude oil price forecast for December 2024 was increased by $3 to $100 per barrel. The New York-based financial services firm believes that the market has not completely priced in the impact of the production cut as this development is countered by recessionary fears globally. The firm suggests that if the US economy manages to avoid a severe recession and achieves a soft landing, there is a high likelihood of a price rally in the crude oil market following the “great de-stocking” that is currently taking place. Additionally, OPEC+ has the option to implement further production cuts in their upcoming meeting to prevent a supply glut and a decline in prices. You can also read our article on the 11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy As Tensions Rise.Anticipated Increase in Global Crude Oil DemandThe International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates global crude oil demand increasing to record levels during the second half of 2023 due to an economic rebound in China, a strong demand outlook from India, ease of macroeconomic uncertainty in the US and Europe, and a rebound in air traffic. The IEA's analysis suggests that between the first and fourth quarters of 2023, global oil demand is set to increase by a total of 3.2 million bpd, resulting in an average growth of 2 million bpd for the year. While the demand for crude oil remains strong in the long term, the transition to cleaner energy sources is a crucial consideration. Landmark policies like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced by the US Federal government in August 2022 will play an important role in commercializing cleaner energy sources. As the world aims to achieve net-zero emissions by the mid-century and reduce reliance on conventional energy sources like crude oil, the transition to cleaner energy sources by some of the best oil companies is imperative. Some of the best oil stocks attracting hedge fund investment as of Q1 2023 include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).10 Oil Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnPhoto by Zbynek Burival on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey's database of billionaire-owned stocks to shortlist the oil stocks that attracted the highest number of billionaire investors during Q1 2023.

Overall natural gas storage inventories recently have reached slightly elevated levels, due largely to the milder than average winter experienced across the globe. This dynamic has weighed on benchmark natural gas prices, and in turn has pressured Antero’s stock. Despite these current headwinds, we believe the company’s relatively low-cost operations, strong balance sheet, positive recent productivity trends, and ability to price its production at a premium to benchmark prices should position it well to weather the current choppy environment until the country’s liquified natural gas export capacity increases over the next several years.”7.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at Packaging Corporation of America's (NYSE:PKG) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Packaging Corporation of America, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$1.4b ÷ (US$8.0b - US$829m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Packaging Corporation of America has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Packaging industry average of 11% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Packaging Corporation of America compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Packaging Corporation of America.How Are Returns Trending?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 19% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 32% in that time. Since 19% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Packaging Corporation of America's ROCETo sum it up, Packaging Corporation of America has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And given the stock has only risen 22% over the last five years, we'd suspect the market is beginning to recognize these trends. So because of the trends we're seeing, we'd recommend looking further into this stock to see if it has the makings of a multi-bagger.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Packaging Corporation of America  that we think you should be aware of.While Packaging Corporation of America isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

23,a33a6e1b-01d1-32c9-8daf-baac49752748,NTRS,2023-06-04,Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS) Will Pay A US$0.75 Dividend In Four Days,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-trust-corporation-nasdaq-ntrs-124211866.html,1685796131,STORY,['NTRS'],"[Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Northern Trust's shares on or after the 8th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of July.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.75 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.00 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Northern Trust has a trailing yield of 4.0% on the current share price of $75.18. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Northern Trust's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Northern Trust If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Northern Trust is paying out an acceptable 50% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Northern Trust, with earnings per share up 3.5% on average over the last five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Northern Trust has increased its dividend at approximately 9.6% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Northern Trust for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have been growing at a reasonable rate, and the company is paying out a bit over half its earnings as dividends. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're on the fence about its dividend prospects.Wondering what the future holds for Northern Trust?

The research presented reinforces the efficacy of LUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS® (sotorasib) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Additionally, data from SCARLET, an Amgen funded investigator study sponsored by the West Japan Oncology Group, will be presented on June 6 and is the first study to highlight the safety and efficacy of sotorasib in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for frontline treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC harboring a KRAS G12C mutation.""As the leader in KRAS inhibition, Amgen continues to advance the CodeBreaK program by evaluating LUMAKRAS across different indications and combinations to potentially help more people living with KRAS G12C-mutated cancers,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""These data presented at ASCO underscore the clinical importance of LUMAKRAS, including the only randomized trial of a KRASG12C inhibitor to show higher intracranial activity compared to chemotherapy, along with data validating our combination treatment approach in metastatic colorectal cancer, where new precision medicine strategies are desperately needed.""Story continuesImproved CNS Activity in Advanced NSCLCIn the first and only randomized study for any KRASG12C inhibitor, data from a post-hoc analysis of the global Phase 3 CodeBreaK 200 trial included patients with advanced NSCLC and treated/stable central nervous system (CNS) lesions at baseline, as assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR). In this analysis using a modified exploratory response assessment in neuro-oncology brain metastases (RANO-BM), LUMAKRAS demonstrated delayed time to CNS progression and longer CNS progression-free survival (PFS) compared with docetaxel.Additionally, the CNS objective response rate (ORR),* an assessment of CNS tumor shrinkage following treatment, was more than double (33.3% vs 15.4%) in patients treated with LUMAKRAS (n= 18) compared to docetaxel (n= 13). The safety profile in this analysis was similar to the CodeBreaK 200 overall population.""CNS metastases are an unfortunately common complication of KRAS G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC, occurring in about 30–40% of patients,"" said Melissa L. Johnson, M.D., director of Lung Cancer Research, Sarah Cannon Research Institute at Tennessee Oncology. ""In this post-hoc analysis from CodeBreaK 200, sotorasib delayed CNS progression-free survival by more than five months and is a potential clinically meaningful benefit for second-line NSCLC patients with KRAS G12C mutations.""These results will be presented on Sunday, June 4, as a late-breaking abstract in a poster discussion session: Lung Cancer—Non-Small Cell Metastatic, beginning at 4:30 p.m. CDT. (#LBA9016).*Exploratory post-hoc analysis in patients with stable/treated CNS lesions at baseline, in which measurable lesions were defined per study as CNS lesions ≥10 mm in diameter by BICR using modified RANO-BM Criteria  New NSCLC Biomarker Data from CodeBreaK 200 Show Consistent Clinical Benefit Across SubgroupsIn the first randomized, molecularly-defined analysis of a KRASG12C inhibitor versus chemotherapy, LUMAKRAS showed improved PFS over docetaxel, irrespective of PD-L1 expression level, and retained PFS benefit versus docetaxel across key co-alteration subgroups (including STK11, KEAP1, TP53). Collectively, the biomarker data help inform treatment decision making and the ongoing CodeBreaK clinical development program, which explores LUMAKRAS in novel combinations.These data will be presented on Tuesday, June 6 during an oral abstract session: Lung Cancer–Non-Small Cell Metastatic, from 9:45 a.m.- 12:45 p.m. CDT (Abstract #9008).Encouraging Safety and Efficacy in Metastatic CRCData from the CodeBreaK 101 Phase 1B study, the first reported results for the combination of LUMAKRAS with Vectibix® (panitumumab) and FOLFIRI, showed encouraging safety and efficacy in previously-treated KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic CRC.Among 42 patients evaluable for response, confirmed ORR was 55% (95% CI: 38.7, 70.2), and disease control rate (DCR) was 93% (95% CI: 80.5, 98.5), with responses observed regardless of the number of prior lines of therapy and regardless of progression on prior irinotecan-based therapy. LUMAKRAS plus Vectibix and FOLFIRI combination reported adverse events consistent with those expected for the therapies under study.""A priority in KRAS G12C-mutated colorectal cancer research is exploring new treatment combinations that can drastically improve response rates attained with current treatments, which can be as low as 2%,"" said lead investigator, David S. Hong, M.D., professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. ""These results showed encouraging efficacy with sotorasib in combination with panitumumab and FOLFIRI, and importantly showed consistent safety for each product.""These data will be presented on Monday, June 5 during a poster discussion session: Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal, from 1:15-2:45 p.m. CDT (Abstract #3513.)More information on Amgen's abstracts is available on the ASCO website.About LUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS® (sotorasib)Amgen took on one of the toughest challenges of the last 40 years in cancer research by developing LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, a KRASG12C inhibitor.i LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS has demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile with rapid, deep, and durable anticancer activity in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the KRAS G12C mutation with a once daily oral formulation.iiAmgen is progressing the largest and broadest global KRASG12C inhibitor development program with unparalleled speed and exploring more than 10 sotorasib combination regimens, with clinical trial sites spanning five continents. To date, over 6,500 patients around the world have received LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS through the clinical development program and commercial use.In May 2021, LUMAKRAS was the first KRASG12C inhibitor to receive regulatory approval with its approval in the U.S., under accelerated approval. LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS is also approved in the European Union, Japan, United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Taiwan, Qatar, and in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Great Britain, Singapore, and Israel under the FDA's Project Orbis. Additionally, Amgen has submitted MAAs in Argentina, Colombia, Kuwait, Macao, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey.LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS is also being studied in multiple other solid tumors.iii About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and the KRAS G12C MutationLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and it accounts for more deaths worldwide than colon cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.iv Overall survival rates for NSCLC are improving but remain poor for patients with advanced disease, and 5-year survival is only 9% for those with metastatic disease.vKRAS G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC.vi About 13% of patients with NSCLC harbor the KRAS G12C mutation.[vii] Unmet medical need remains high and treatment options are limited for NSCLC patients with the KRAS G12C mutation whose first-line treatment has failed to work or has stopped working. The outcomes with other approved therapies are suboptimal, with a median progression-free survival of approximately four months following second-line treatment of KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC.viiiAbout Advanced Colorectal Cancer and the KRAS G12C MutationColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, comprising 10% of all cancer diagnoses.ix It is also the third most commonly diagnosed cancer globally.xPatients with previously treated metastatic CRC need more effective treatment options. For patients in the third-line setting, standard therapies yield median PFS times of about two months and patients' response rates are less than 2%.xi,xiiKRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in colorectal cancers, with the KRAS G12C mutation present in approximately 3-5% of colorectal cancers.xiii,xiv,xvAbout CodeBreaK The CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen's drug sotorasib is designed to study patients with an advanced solid tumor with the KRAS G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers. CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors.xvi Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The Phase 2 trial in NSCLC enrolled 126 patients, 124 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline.ii The Phase 2 trial in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is fully enrolled and results have been published.xviiCodeBreaK 200, the global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC completed enrollment of 345 patients. Eligible patients had previously treated, locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival and key secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response rate, and patient-reported outcomes.xviiiAmgen also has several Phase 1b studies investigating sotorasib monotherapy and sotorasib combination therapy across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment.xix A Phase 2 randomized study will evaluate sotorasib in patients with stage IV KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in need of first-line treatment (CodeBreaK 201).xxLUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) U.S. IndicationLUMAKRAS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) Important U.S. Safety Information Hepatotoxicity LUMAKRAS can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and hepatitis.Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100, hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.7% (all grades) and 1.4% (Grade 3). A total of 18% of patients who received LUMAKRAS had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST); 6% were Grade 3 and 0.6% were Grade 4. In addition to dose interruption or reduction, 5% of patients received corticosteroids for the treatment of hepatotoxicity.Monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST and total bilirubin) prior to the start of LUMAKRAS every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations.Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS based on severity of adverse reaction.Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis LUMAKRAS can cause ILD/pneumonitis that can be fatal. Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.8% of patients, all cases were Grade 3 or 4 at onset, and 1 case was fatal. LUMAKRAS was discontinued due to ILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients.Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold LUMAKRAS in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 20% were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity and cough.Drug Interactions Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant medications, including prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, dietary and herbal products.Inform patients to avoid proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists while taking LUMAKRAS.If coadministration with an acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, inform patients to take LUMAKRAS 4 hours before or 10 hours after a locally acting antacid.Please see LUMAKRAS full Prescribing Information. About Vectibix® (panitumumab)Vectibix is the first fully human monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody approved by the FDA for the treatment of mCRC. Vectibix was approved in the U.S. in September 2006 as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC after disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.In May 2014, the FDA approved Vectibix for use in combination with FOLFOX, as first-line treatment in patients with wild-type KRAS (exon 2) mCRC. With this approval, Vectibix became the first-and-only biologic therapy indicated for use with FOLFOX, one of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens, in the first-line treatment of mCRC for patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC.In June 2017, the FDA approved a refined indication for Vectibix for use in patients with wild-type RAS (defined as wild-type in both KRAS and NRAS as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use) mCRC.INDICATION AND LIMITATION OF USEVectibix® is indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type RAS (defined as wild-type in both KRAS and NRAS as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC): as first-line therapy in combination with FOLFOX, and as monotherapy following disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.Limitation of Use: Vectibix® is not indicated for the treatment of patients with RAS mutant mCRC or for whom RAS mutation status is unknown.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION BOXED WARNING: DERMATOLOGIC TOXICITY Dermatologic Toxicity: Dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients receiving Vectibix monotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].In Study 20020408, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients with mCRC receiving Vectibix®. The clinical manifestations included, but were not limited to, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, erythema, rash, skin exfoliation, paronychia, dry skin, and skin fissures.Monitor patients who develop dermatologic or soft tissue toxicities while on Vectibix® for the development of inflammatory or infectious sequelae. Life-threatening and fatal infectious complications including necrotizing fasciitis, abscesses, and sepsis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix®. Life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing has also been observed in patients treated with Vectibix®. It could not be determined whether these mucocutaneous adverse reactions were directly related to EGFR inhibition or to idiosyncratic immune- related effects (e.g., Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis). Withhold or discontinue Vectibix® for dermatologic or soft tissue toxicity associated with severe or life-threatening inflammatory or infectious complications. Dose modifications for Vectibix® concerning dermatologic toxicity are provided in the product labeling.Vectibix® is not indicated for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer that harbor somatic RAS mutations in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) of either KRAS or NRAS and hereafter is referred to as ""RAS.""Retrospective subset analyses across several randomized clinical trials were conducted to investigate the role of RAS mutations on the clinical effects of anti-EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies (panitumumab or cetuximab). Anti-EGFR antibodies in patients with tumors containing RAS mutations resulted in exposing those patients to anti-EGFR related adverse reactions without clinical benefit from these agents. Additionally, in Study 20050203, 272 patients with RAS-mutant mCRC tumors received Vectibix® in combination with FOLFOX and 276 patients received FOLFOX alone. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, OS was shorter (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.45) in patients with RAS-mutant mCRC who received Vectibix® and FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone.Progressively decreasing serum magnesium levels leading to severe (grade 3-4) hypomagnesemia occurred in up to 7% (in Study 20080763) of patients across clinical trials. Monitor patients for hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating Vectibix® treatment, periodically during Vectibix® treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after the completion of treatment. Other electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, have also been observed. Replete magnesium and other electrolytes as appropriate.In Study 20020408, 4% of patients experienced infusion reactions and 1% of patients experienced severe infusion reactions (NCI-CTC grade 3-4). Infusion reactions, manifesting as fever, chills, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypotension, can occur following Vectibix® administration. Fatal infusion reactions occurred in postmarketing experience. Terminate the infusion for severe infusion reactions.Severe diarrhea and dehydration, leading to acute renal failure and other complications, have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix® in combination with chemotherapy.Fatal and nonfatal cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (1%) and pulmonary fibrosis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix®. Pulmonary fibrosis occurred in less than 1% (2/1467) of patients enrolled in clinical studies of Vectibix®. In the event of acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms interrupt Vectibix® therapy. Discontinue Vectibix® therapy if ILD is confirmed.In patients with a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, the benefits of therapy with Vectibix® versus the risk of pulmonary complications must be carefully considered.Exposure to sunlight can exacerbate dermatologic toxicity. Advise patients to wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun exposure while receiving Vectibix®.Keratitis and ulcerative keratitis, known risk factors for corneal perforation, have been reported with Vectibix® use. Monitor for evidence of keratitis or ulcerative keratitis. Interrupt or discontinue Vectibix® for acute or worsening keratitis.In an interim analysis of an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial in the first-line setting in patients with mCRC, the addition of Vectibix® to the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy resulted in decreased OS and increased incidence of NCI-CTC grade 3-5 (87% vs 72%) adverse reactions. NCI-CTC grade 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher rate in Vectibix®-treated patients included rash/acneiform dermatitis (26% vs 1%), diarrhea (23% vs 12%), dehydration (16% vs 5%), primarily occurring in patients with diarrhea, hypokalemia (10% vs 4%), stomatitis/mucositis (4% vs &lt; 1%), and hypomagnesemia (4% vs 0).NCI-CTC grade 3-5 pulmonary embolism occurred at a higher rate in Vectibix®-treated patients (7% vs 3%) and included fatal events in three (&lt; 1%) Vectibix®-treated patients. As a result of the toxicities experienced, patients randomized to Vectibix®, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy received a lower mean relative dose intensity of each chemotherapeutic agent (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bolus 5-FU, and/or infusional 5-FU) over the first 24 weeks on study compared with those randomized to bevacizumab and chemotherapy.Vectibix® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for at least 2 months after the last dose of Vectibix®.In monotherapy, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients with Vectibix® were skin rash with variable presentations, paronychia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) with Vectibix® + FOLFOX were diarrhea, stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, paronychia, anorexia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, rash, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, and dry skin. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2% difference between treatment arms) were diarrhea and dehydration.To see the Vectibix® Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning, visit www.vectibix.com.About Amgen OncologyAt Amgen Oncology, our mission to serve patients drives all that we do.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products.

In the end, stocks reflect the growth potential of the underlying company. Sustainable revenue and profit growth over the long run are what truly make an unstoppable stock generate significant wealth for its shareholders.When macroeconomic conditions become uncertain, investors can turn to certain stocks that have a track record of defying market downturns. Here are three unstoppable stocks long-term investors will want to consider on any significant downturn moving forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMcDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is one of the largest fast-food restaurant chains in the world. While the broader market has been down since early 2022, this company is setting new highs. Sales growth and profitability are increasing, making it an attractive option for Wall Street despite consumer spending cutbacks in other areas.McDonald’s stock has gained over 8% in equity value since the start of the year due to its Q1 2023 net income increase. Although McDonald’s impact on consumer health is a concern, analysts view it as a strong buy due to its potential for portfolio growth, with a target price of $317.79.McDonald’s is thriving in the expanding fast-food industry with a 13% increase in comparable-store sales in Q1. The chain is outpacing competitors like Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) due to higher customer traffic and increased spending from rising menu prices. Customer satisfaction initiatives such as better staffing, training and quicker order delivery are contributing to this growth, making it more sustainable than relying on new limited-time menu items. This is good news for investors.Newmont Gold (NEM)A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocksSource: ShutterstockDespite the Federal Reserve’s continuous tightening of monetary conditions, gold is performing strongly lately. This should make it deflationary for gold, but it hasn’t been the case. Therefore, Newmont Gold (NYSE:NEM) is a potential option for investors looking for inflation-resistant stocks.Story continuesNewmont is an attractive option for investors seeking inflation-resistant stocks due to the strong performance of gold, despite the Fed’s monetary tightening program. The company’s copper business is also a contributing factor to its success. Although its financials may need some improvement, analysts rate NEM as a strong buy with an average price target of $59.59, indicating a potential 46.48% upside.Newmont has strong high-quality assets, with 96 million ounces of reserves, ensuring stable production in the future. It has planned to reduce its all-in-sustaining cost over the next three years, which will lead to EBITDA margin expansion, even if gold prices remain flat. With a stable investment-grade balance sheet, Newmont is well-positioned to provide sustained shareholder value.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockInvestors today may not recall the 1980s cola wars between PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), as both companies have expanded beyond carbonated drinks. This strategy has enabled them to provide shareholder value through dividends and share buybacks.But for several decades, PepsiCo has proven to be a popular pick for dividend shareholders looking for steady revenue. But the stock has also attracted other investors, as it recently surged to record highs and approached the $200 level.PepsiCo outperformed the overall market with strong Q1 earnings per share of $1.50 versus the anticipated $1.37. Sales for the firm climbed by 10.2% to $17.85 billion, exceeding estimates of $17.27 billion and demonstrating PepsiCo’s tremendous expansion.PepsiCo recently increased its dividend by 10%, and also raised its full-year organic growth guidance. This food and beverage conglomerate has an impressive brand and a long history of raising its annual payout for 51 years straight, making it an attractive investment option.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in MCD.

27,065a4a25-19a7-3f5a-bb0d-640bf5c8406f,MAS,2023-06-04,What Does Masco Corporation's (NYSE:MAS) Share Price Indicate?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-masco-corporations-nyse-mas-123024849.html,1685795424,STORY,['MAS'],"[Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$53.90 and falling to the lows of US$47.04. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Masco's current trading price of US$51.47 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Masco’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Masco What Is Masco Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 7.93% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Masco today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $47.69, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Masco’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Masco?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 12% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Masco. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MAS’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MAS, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Masco (including 1 which can't be ignored).If you are no longer interested in Masco, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

After a median follow-up of 25.2 months, neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy followed by resection and adjuvant single-agent KEYTRUDA significantly improved EFS, reducing the risk of disease recurrence, progression or death by 42% (HR=0.58 [95% CI, 0.46-0.72]; p&lt;0.00001) for patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB NSCLC versus neoadjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant placebo. For patients who received the KEYTRUDA-based regimen, median EFS was not reached (95% CI, 34.1-NR) versus 17 months (95% CI, 14.3-22) for patients who received chemotherapy alone.The trial is continuing to allow for additional follow-up of overall survival (OS), the other dual primary endpoint. A favorable trend in OS was observed for the KEYTRUDA regimen versus pre-operative chemotherapy (HR 0.73 [95% CI, 0.54-0.99]; p=0.02124); with only 177 events, these OS data are not mature and did not reach statistical significance at the time of this interim analysis. The safety profile of the KEYTRUDA regimen was consistent with the safety profile in earlier stages and metastatic NSCLC, with no new safety concerns identified. These results are being presented today during a clinical science symposium, The Promise of Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Across Solid Tumors, at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (abstract #LBA100) and are also being simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Story continuesIn a subgroup analysis, improvement in EFS with the KEYTRUDA regimen was consistent across PD-L1 expression subgroups, histology and stage. Treatment with the KEYTRUDA-based regimen reduced the risk of EFS events regardless of PD-L1 expression versus the chemotherapy-placebo regimen (tumor proportion score [TPS] ≥50% [n=266] HR=0.42 [95% CI, 0.28-0.65]; TPS 1-49% [n=242] HR=0.51 [95% CI, 0.34-0.75]; TPS &lt;1% [n=289] HR=0.77 [95% CI, 0.55-1.07]). The KEYTRUDA-based regimen also improved EFS compared with the chemotherapy-placebo regimen regardless of histology (nonsquamous [n=453] HR=0.58 [95% CI, 0.43-0.78]; squamous [n=344] HR=0.57 [95% CI, 0.41-0.77]) and stage (stage II [n=239] HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.42-1.01]; stage IIIA [n=442] HR=0.54 [95% CI, 0.41-0.72]; stage IIIB [n=116] HR=0.52 [95% CI, 0.31-0.88]).While achieving pCR is a predictor of better outcomes, an exploratory subgroup analysis showed the reduction in EFS events with the KEYTRUDA perioperative regimen was observed for patients with or without pCR (with pCR: HR=0.33 [95% CI, 0.09-1.22]; without pCR: HR=0.69 [95% CI, 0.55-0.86]).""Historically, more than half of people with earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer that has been surgically removed will experience recurrence,"" said Dr. Heather Wakelee, thoracic medical oncologist and professor of medicine at Stanford Medicine, president of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and principal investigator for KEYNOTE-671. ""Results showed that a pembrolizumab-based regimen before and after surgery significantly reduced the risk of recurrence, progression or death by 42 percent versus pre-operative chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 expression and with or without a pathological complete response. These event-free survival data are very encouraging and support the potential of this perioperative approach for patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.""""These compelling new results build on previous studies of KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of disease across certain types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer,"" said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of late-stage oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""KEYNOTE-671 demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in event-free survival for patients with stage II, IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treated with the KEYTRUDA perioperative regimen compared with chemotherapy and surgery alone. We are working with the FDA and other global authorities to bring this new option to patients as quickly as possible.""""These results are meaningful for the community of thoracic surgeons given the need for additional treatment options that can improve event-free survival for patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer,"" said Dr. Jonathan Spicer, associate professor of surgery, McGill University, attending surgeon, division of thoracic and upper gastrointestinal surgery, Montreal General Hospital, McGill University Health Centre and KEYNOTE-671 investigator. ""Notably, the results showed that the KEYTRUDA-based perioperative regimen did not impact the opportunity for a complete resection and improvements were seen regardless of if they achieved a pathological complete response or not.""Merck previously announced that, based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted a new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with resectable stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (T3-4N2) NSCLC in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or target action, date of October 16, 2023.In addition to KEYNOTE-671, seven other pivotal trials evaluating a KEYTRUDA-based regimen in patients with earlier stages of cancer met their primary endpoint(s). These trials included: KEYNOTE-057 in Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer; KEYNOTE-629 in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; KEYNOTE-716 in stage IIB and IIC melanoma; KEYNOTE-054 in stage III melanoma; KEYNOTE-091 in stage IB, II or IIIA NSCLC; KEYNOTE-564 in renal cell carcinoma; and KEYNOTE-522 in triple-negative breast cancer.The seven positive pivotal studies in lung cancer include: KEYNOTE-189, KEYNOTE-407, KEYNOTE-042, KEYNOTE-024, KEYNOTE-010, KEYNOTE-091 and KEYNOTE-671.Merck has an extensive clinical development program in lung cancer and is advancing multiple registration-enabling studies, with research directed at earlier stages of disease and novel combinations. Key studies in earlier stages of NSCLC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) include KEYNOTE-671, KEYNOTE-091, KEYNOTE-867, KEYLYNK-012, KEYVIBE-006 and KEYLYNK-013.As announced, data spanning more than 25 different types of cancer are being presented from Merck’s broad oncology portfolio and investigational pipeline at the 2023 ASCO Annual Meeting. A compendium of Merck’s presentations and posters is available here.Study design and additional data from KEYNOTE-671KEYNOTE-671 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03425643) evaluating neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, followed by resection and adjuvant KEYTRUDA as a single agent, versus placebo plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by resection and adjuvant placebo, in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB (T3-4N2) NSCLC. The trial’s dual primary endpoints are EFS and OS. Key secondary endpoints include pCR and major pathological response (mPR). The study enrolled 797 patients who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either:KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] every three weeks [Q3W] for up to four cycles) plus chemotherapy (cisplatin [75 mg/m2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle] and either gemcitabine [1000 mg/m2, IV; given on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle or pemetrexed [500 mg/m2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle]) as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery, followed by KEYTRUDA (200 mg IV Q3W for up to 13 cycles) as adjuvant therapy post-surgery (n=397) for up to 13 cycles, or;Placebo (saline IV Q3W for up to four cycles) plus chemotherapy (cisplatin [75 mg/m2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle] and either gemcitabine [1000 mg/m2, IV; given on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle] or pemetrexed [500 mg/m2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle]) as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery, followed by placebo (saline IV Q3W for up to 13 cycles) as adjuvant therapy post-surgery (n=400) for up to 13 cycles.As previously announced, KEYNOTE-671 met the dual primary endpoint of EFS at the first interim analysis. At two years, 62.4% of patients treated with the KEYTRUDA regimen were alive and did not experience an EFS event compared to 40.6% of patients treated with the chemotherapy-placebo regimen.The KEYTRUDA-based perioperative treatment regimen also demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in key secondary endpoints of pCR and mPR. In the study, 18.1% of patients treated with the KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy regimen achieved pCR versus 4% of patients treated with pre-operative chemotherapy (difference: 14.2% (95% CI: 10.1-18.7); p&lt;0.00001). Additionally, treatment with the KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy regimen resulted in a 30.2% mPR rate, meaning 10% or less or their tumor cells remained after receiving perioperative treatment, versus 11% with chemotherapy alone (difference: 19.2% [95% CI: 13.9-24.7]; p&lt;0.00001).Among patients treated with pre-operative KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, 80.6% underwent definitive surgery compared to 75.5% who received chemotherapy alone. Of these patients, 92% and 84% had a complete resection (R0 resection), respectively.Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 96.7% of patients receiving the KEYTRUDA regimen (n=396) and 95% of patients receiving the chemotherapy-placebo regimen (n=399); Grade 3-5 TRAEs occurred in 44.9% versus 37.3%, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events led to discontinuation of all study treatment in 12.6% of patients treated with the KEYTRUDA regimen and 5.3% treated with the chemotherapy-placebo regimen. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in 1.0% of patients receiving the KEYTRUDA regimen (n=4) and 0.8% of patients receiving the chemotherapy-placebo regimen (n=3). No new safety concerns were identified.Immune-mediated adverse events (AEs) and infusion reactions of any grade occurred in 25.3% of patients receiving the KEYTRUDA regimen and 10.5% of patients receiving the chemotherapy-placebo regimen. Grade 3-5 immune-mediated AEs and infusion reactions occurred in 5.8% versus 1.5%, respectively. The most common of these events (occurring in ≥10% of patients) was hypothyroidism (11.1%) in patients receiving the KEYTRUDA regimen. Immune-mediated AEs and infusion reactions led to death in 0.3% of patients receiving the KEYTRUDA regimen (n=1) and no patients receiving the chemotherapy-placebo regimen. Immune-mediated AEs and infusion reactions that led to discontinuation of all study treatment occurred in 5.1% of patients receiving the KEYTRUDA regimen and 0.8% of patients receiving the chemotherapy-placebo regimen.About lung cancerLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 81% of all cases. In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25%, which is a 21% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. However, screening, early detection and improving treatment rates remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2021.About Merck’s research in lung cancerMerck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has five approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical programFinding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal DysfunctionKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (28%), diarrhea (26%), rash (24%), and nausea (21%).In KEYNOTE-054, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to patients with stage III melanoma, KEYTRUDA was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of 509 patients; the most common (≥1%) were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most common adverse reaction (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA was diarrhea (28%). In KEYNOTE-716, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma, adverse reactions occurring in patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma were similar to those occurring in 1011 patients with stage III melanoma from KEYNOTE-054.In KEYNOTE-189, when KEYTRUDA was administered with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 20% of 405 patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonitis (3%) and acute kidney injury (2%).

If you don't want to read the detailed analysis, you can head straight to the 5 PayPal Alternatives For International Payments.In today's interconnected global economy, businesses of all sizes and industries rely on smooth and efficient international payment solutions to conduct cross-border transactions. While PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has long been a dominant player in the market, offering a convenient and widely recognized platform, businesses must explore alternatives that cater to their needs.  According to BBC Research, the global cross-border payment market is projected to reach $238.8 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% from 2022-2027. With such significant growth, businesses must stay abreast of the latest developments in global payment solutions.  Additionally, businesses that use PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) or other traditional payment methods may be subject to high transaction fees, which can affect their profits. Companies can save money and improve their bottom line by exploring alternative options. Critical Considerations for Choosing a Secure and Reliable Payment Method for Global Businesses As a global business, finding a reliable payment method is crucial to ensuring your transactions are seamless and secure. According to the data collected by Trading Platforms, the digital payments sector is projected to experience significant growth of 15% year-over-year, reaching an estimated total transaction value of approximately $9.5 trillion by 2023. With so many International payment options available, choosing the right one for your business needs can be overwhelming. However, taking the time to research and compare different payment methods can save you both time and money in the long run. When choosing a payment method, consider transaction fees, processing time, and currency conversion rates. It's also essential to select a payment method accepted in the countries where you do business. For example, if you do business in China, it's vital to offer payment methods such as Alipay and WeChat Pay, which are the preferred payment options for Chinese consumers. Story continuesAnother crucial factor to consider is security. According to Verizon's 2019 Payment Security Report, only 36% of global organizations were fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. With the increasing threat of cybercrime, choosing a payment method that offers robust security features such as encryption and fraud detection is crucial. Additionally, it's essential to ensure that your payment processor has a good reputation and a track record of protecting its clients' financial information. The global payments industry experienced a remarkable rebound in 2021, surpassing pre-pandemic expectations and showcasing strong growth. According to McKinsey's recent report, the industry's revenue is projected to exceed $3 trillion by 2026. The Future of International Payment Solutions: Digital Currencies, Mobile Payments, Fraud Prevention, and AI Innovations Digital currencies and blockchain technology are revolutionizing the future of international payment solutions. The global market for blockchain technology is projected to reach a staggering value of $57,641.3 million by the year 2025, reflecting a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69.4% during the period from 2019 to 2025, with the finance sector being the largest adopter of this technology. These innovations provide faster and more secure cross-border transactions, making them highly appealing to businesses and consumers. On the other hand, mobile payment solutions will become even more prevalent as consumers increasingly rely on their smartphones to purchase and transfer money. This trend will continue as mobile devices become more advanced and ubiquitous. According to Business of Apps, mobile payments transaction volume reached $1.7 billion in 2021, a 27% annual increase. Moreover, in the international payment solutions industry, there will be a growing focus on transparency, compliance, and fraud prevention. According to Digital 360, U.S.-based e-commerce merchants saw a 24.2% increase in monthly fraud attempts, reaching 344 in 2020 compared to 277 in 2019. However, the prevention rate declined to 34.3% in 2020, with 118 cases successfully stopped, compared to a 56.3% prevention rate in 2019, where 156 fraud attempts were prevented. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will also play an increasingly important role in international payment solutions, helping companies to detect and prevent fraud, automate processes, and improve customer service. A study by Juniper Research estimated that AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants in banking would save businesses over $8 billion per year by 2022. Innovation in payment methods and technologies will continue to drive the industry forward, with new solutions emerging to meet the evolving needs of businesses and consumers worldwide. From biometric authentication to virtual currencies, there will be no shortage of exciting developments.15 PayPal Alternatives For International PaymentsOur Methodology Our methodology for identifying PayPal alternatives for international payments involved conducting thorough research using sources such as Tipalti, Software Testing Help, Oberlo, and Indeed.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.9bUS$10.2bUS$9.87bUS$9.69bUS$9.63bUS$9.65bUS$9.73bUS$9.84bUS$9.99bUS$10.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -3.45%Est @ -1.78%Est @ -0.61%Est @ 0.20%Est @ 0.78%Est @ 1.18%Est @ 1.46%Est @ 1.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$9.9kUS$8.4kUS$7.4kUS$6.6kUS$5.9kUS$5.4kUS$4.9kUS$4.5kUS$4.2kUS$3.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$61bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$128bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$128b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$48bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$109b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$132, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Business Machines as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.364. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for International Business MachinesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Then starting in 2025, all new Ford EVs will ship with Tesla’s NACS (North American Charging Standard) charging connector, as opposed to the CCS standard which most other EV automakers have been using.""Working with Elon and his team, I’m really excited for our industry and for the Ford customers,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said during the Twitter Spaces event.

Ford did reiterate that its own BlueOval Charge Network of 10,000+ fast chargers would still be available, giving Ford owners more choice, and a big leg up on the competition with Tesla’s network on tap.Reaction across the automotive world was mixed, but one thing was for certain: it was a shock.""Ford blindsided the entire industry with this brilliant move and solidified its position as a leader in the transition to electric vehicles,"" said Tom Moloughney, EV charging expert and senior editor at InsideEVs to Yahoo Finance. ""The Ford/Tesla deal will cause some initial disruption in the industry, but it will prove to be good for the consumer in the long run.""Story continuesWall Street is generally supportive of the deal as well, with Ford owners (and presumptive owners) receiving a big benefit that could help sell more of the company’s EVs.""To the extent it helps Ford sell more EVs, it also reinforces the importance of getting to profitability on those vehicle sales,"" Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note to investors. ""Ford discussed having EVs that can charge quickly (and have a smaller battery) as part of its strategy to improve user experience and profits at its recent investor day, and we view this step to enhance the charging network as a step toward that.""""In terms of vehicles on the road and fast charge ports, NACS is the leading standard in the US,"" Guidehouse Sr. Research Analyst Mike Austin told Yahoo Finance. ""I think it’s a good move for Ford, or at least not a negative – everyone (Tesla and other automakers) will probably need an adapter one way or the other anyway – so getting access to Superchargers requires moving to NACS, it’s probably worth it.""Tesla and SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk speaks at the SATELLITE Conference and Exhibition in Washington, Monday, March 9, 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Even Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg expressed support for the Ford/Tesla deal as good for consumers.""We're really glad to see this deal and any deal that means more access for more drivers to more electric chargers,"" Secretary Buttigieg said in an interview with Yahoo Finance this week. ""We are on an aggressive journey to get to the president's vision of half a million chargers by the end of the decade across America, and there's already this remarkable charging network that Tesla has built. So for that to be accessible to more drivers is, I think, very positive news.""Buttigieg continued that regardless of charger plug standard - CCS vs NACS or even the CHAdeMo standard that Nissan uses, the availability of adapters for interoperability will be crucial. Most importantly for consumers is for the sheer number of chargers to increase, and those networks are opened up to all users. Tesla has promised to open up more of its Supercharger network to other users by the end of next year, but the rollout is coming along slowly.Not surprisingly, automakers that are tied to the CCS standard, as well as charging companies aligned with a more agnostic approach to charging standards, aren’t ready to anoint Ford’s tie-up with NACS as a game changer.""GM believes that open charging networks and standards are the best way forward to enable EV adoption across the industry,"" a GM spokesperson said to Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""That’s why we joined with a group of companies and the SAE to develop and continue to refine an open connector standard in the Combined Charging System (CCS), which we believe is a truly universal solution available today for fast charging.""""EVgo remains committed to Electric For All, and we continue to be ready to charge any and all EVs on our network, including Fords, Teslas, and dozens of other models,"" EVgo said to Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""We're looking forward to learning more about how this partnership will be implemented.""There is some concern from Tesla owners about Ford EV owners potentially clogging their Supercharger stalls in the future, but the high availability rate of Tesla’s chargers and relatively small user base of Ford EV owners should likely mitigate any concerns about availability.Again, Wall Street is somewhat bullish on the deal for Tesla.""Recall in our 2022 report that we sized the potential for Tesla opening its network more widely in the next few years (i.e. more than just Ford) at $1-$3 bn of incremental revenue (although Tesla wouldn’t necessarily capture all of this),"" Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in his note. ""We believe the news is a modest incremental positive for Tesla as it will likely bring in additional profits and help Tesla to sustain the most robust charging network, albeit with some risk of fewer vehicle sales.""""The main upside for Tesla is that it helps increase Supercharger revenue (and utilization). Compared to cars this is low capital and steady revenue, and opening it up to non-Tesla vehicles effectively turns it into a standalone business unit,"" Guidehouse’s Mike Austin said.EV charging expert Tom Moloughney was even more effusive in what this deal means for Tesla.""Tesla isn't just a car company, it's an energy provider, and as such, the more customers the better,"" Moloughney told Yahoo Finance. ""As long as Tesla continues to install Superchargers as it has been, the Supercharger experience will remain the best charging experience in the industry, even if other OEMs also join in.""Will NACS be the new standard?A Tesla vehicle connects with a charging station in Westlake, California on May 10, 2023. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The next logical question following Ford’s move: Will others follow suit and effectively make the NACS standard the main system and plug going forward?""The CCS is a great standard, but it was pretty much done by kind of a committee, and I think GM and others are going to have a big choice to make,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said to CNBC. ""Do they want to have fast charging for customers? Or do they want to stick to their standard and have less charging?""As Buttigieg pointed out, if adapters for various plugs exist then any charger will do, however that will be a long time coming, and there is no guarantee the adapters will work as seamlessly as native plugs work now.The Tesla Supercharger experience is true ""plug and play,"" meaning once the plug is connected to the car, the Supercharger system ""knows"" the car, has billing information already on hand, and begins charging. With other networks an app or charger interface must be dealt with, a specific charger selected in the interface, sometimes payment info must be entered, etc., before charging begins.As the EV battlefield grows more intense, it’s possible other manufacturers may hop over to the NACS side to get a better user experience, but that would also mean joining forces with Tesla - a bitter pill to swallow for traditional automakers who have felt under attack from the Musk-led company.For now, it seems Tesla’s NACS is in a better position for wider adoption.""It’s possible,"" Mike Austin said about whether NACS could be the new standard in the US, ""but I think it’s too soon to tell – the Ford vehicles with NACS ports won’t come out until 2025 and it will take a few years after that for all of its EVs to switch over. It’s also possible that Ford could offer both ports.""Moloughney offered a similar sentiment, but added the tide may be turning.""That's still not likely, but it opens the door,"" he says. ""NACS desperately needed a major OEM like Ford to support it for it to have a chance of becoming the main standard. They have that now.""Note: an earlier version of this story mislabeled Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as Treasury Secretary; that error has been corrected.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.1%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. View our latest analysis for Amphenol Amphenol's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. However, Amphenol's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 10.5% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendAmphenol Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.105 total annually to $0.84. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 23% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Amphenol has been growing its earnings per share at 23% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.We Really Like Amphenol's DividendOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Amphenol might even raise payments in the future. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Amphenol that investors should take into consideration.

Susman had been at Pixar since the release of the original “Toy Story” movie in 1995.MacLane and Susman could not be reached for comment. Michael Agulnek, Pixar's vice president of worldwide publicity since 2015, was also laid off, the sources said. He did not return a call seeking comment.The cuts, which took place May 23, are part of Walt Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger’s previously announced plan to eliminate 7,000 jobs and slash $5.5 billion in costs. That restructuring combined the film and television groups into a single Disney Entertainment unit and eliminated a division charged with distribution.While small compared to Pixar's employee base of about 1,200, the layoffs are notable because the studio is a creative force generating franchises and characters that drive revenue across Disney.Pixar is famous for cinematic franchises including “Toy Story,” “The Incredibles” and “Cars.” But “Lightyear,” released a year ago with a reported budget of $200 million, brought in a modest $226.7 million in worldwide ticket sales and received a mixed critical reception.By contrast, Pixar's ""Incredibles 2"" in 2018, which was reported to have had a similar production budget, had worldwide box office sales of $1.2 billion.“Lightyear” could not be shown in 14 Middle Eastern and Asian countries because of its depiction of a same-sex relationship. This had an impact on its box office performance.Disney has implemented layoffs in every division including film and television, streaming services and theme parks.Story continuesThe last time Pixar cut jobs was in 2013, after the studio postponed the release of the 2015 film “The Good Dinosaur,” and removed its director, Bob Peterson.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Oil Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.According to Deloitte, the global oil and gas sector entered 2023 with a strong balance sheet position and a controlled capital spending strategy. The London, UK-based professional services firm supported this claim with the fact that 93% of the executives surveyed in the oil and gas sector reported having a positive outlook on the sector in 2023. They believe that the healthy balance sheet positions could aid their organizations in covering up for the deficit in investment in recent years and play an important role in accelerating the transition towards green energy. The healthy state of the oil and gas exploration and production (E&amp;P) industry is also supported by the fact that the industry generated record free cash flows (FCF) of $1.4 trillion in 2022. Experts are now closely examining how upstream companies will utilize their resources to enhance shareholder value. The focus lies on two main avenues: boosting shareholder payouts through dividends and share buybacks and exploring opportunities for reinvestment and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity. According to Wood Mackenzie, the oil and gas E&amp;P industry is expected to allocate a capital outlay of $470 billion in 2023 to uplift the sector amidst challenging economic circumstances.Despite the possibility of a global recession, crude oil prices have been able to maintain ground. This can be attributed to the significant production cuts made by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) along with Russia and other allies in the recent past. In April, the group revealed a 1.16 million barrels per day (bpd) cut in production. As per estimates by Reuters, OPEC+ has managed to cut global crude oil production by 3.66 million bpd, which is equivalent to 3.7% of the global demand. Currently, crude oil prices are hovering around the $70 level as opposed to a peak of $139 in March 2022. The head of investment firm Pickering Energy Partners thinks that the recent production cuts implemented by OPEC+ could potentially lead to a $10 increase in oil prices per barrel.Story continuesGoldman Sachs' Price Forecasts Following the production cut in April, Goldman Sachs increased its December 2023 price forecast for Brent crude oil by $5 to $95 per barrel. Furthermore, the Brent crude oil price forecast for December 2024 was increased by $3 to $100 per barrel. The New York-based financial services firm believes that the market has not completely priced in the impact of the production cut as this development is countered by recessionary fears globally. The firm suggests that if the US economy manages to avoid a severe recession and achieves a soft landing, there is a high likelihood of a price rally in the crude oil market following the “great de-stocking” that is currently taking place. Additionally, OPEC+ has the option to implement further production cuts in their upcoming meeting to prevent a supply glut and a decline in prices. You can also read our article on the 11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy As Tensions Rise.Anticipated Increase in Global Crude Oil DemandThe International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates global crude oil demand increasing to record levels during the second half of 2023 due to an economic rebound in China, a strong demand outlook from India, ease of macroeconomic uncertainty in the US and Europe, and a rebound in air traffic. The IEA's analysis suggests that between the first and fourth quarters of 2023, global oil demand is set to increase by a total of 3.2 million bpd, resulting in an average growth of 2 million bpd for the year. While the demand for crude oil remains strong in the long term, the transition to cleaner energy sources is a crucial consideration. Landmark policies like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced by the US Federal government in August 2022 will play an important role in commercializing cleaner energy sources. As the world aims to achieve net-zero emissions by the mid-century and reduce reliance on conventional energy sources like crude oil, the transition to cleaner energy sources by some of the best oil companies is imperative.

Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) has secured the eighth position on our list of best oil stocks billionaires are purchasing.In a note issued to investors on May 19, Nitin Kumar at Mizuho increased the target price for Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) stock from $38 to $40 and maintained a Buy rating. The analyst believes that the recent stock sell-off due to plummeting crude oil prices provides an attractive entry point for investors. Kumar highlighted that companies are now focused on capital discipline and better cash returns and have been experiencing an improving service cost environment since Q1 2023.Here’s what Carillon Tower Advisers said about Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) is a natural gas exploration and production company with operations in the Appalachian Basin. Overall natural gas storage inventories recently have reached slightly elevated levels, due largely to the milder than average winter experienced across the globe. This dynamic has weighed on benchmark natural gas prices, and in turn has pressured Antero’s stock. Despite these current headwinds, we believe the company’s relatively low-cost operations, strong balance sheet, positive recent productivity trends, and ability to price its production at a premium to benchmark prices should position it well to weather the current choppy environment until the country’s liquified natural gas export capacity increases over the next several years.”7.

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. Just take a look at Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), which is up 40%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 29% (not including dividends).Since it's been a strong week for Capital One Financial shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Capital One Financial In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Capital One Financial was able to grow its EPS at 41% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 7.52 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Capital One Financial has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Capital One Financial's TSR for the last 3 years was 47%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Capital One Financial had a tough year, with a total loss of 8.8% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 4.2%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Capital One Financial that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

If you don't want to read the detailed analysis, you can head straight to the 5 PayPal Alternatives For International Payments.In today's interconnected global economy, businesses of all sizes and industries rely on smooth and efficient international payment solutions to conduct cross-border transactions. While PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has long been a dominant player in the market, offering a convenient and widely recognized platform, businesses must explore alternatives that cater to their needs.  According to BBC Research, the global cross-border payment market is projected to reach $238.8 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% from 2022-2027. With such significant growth, businesses must stay abreast of the latest developments in global payment solutions.  Additionally, businesses that use PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) or other traditional payment methods may be subject to high transaction fees, which can affect their profits. Companies can save money and improve their bottom line by exploring alternative options. Critical Considerations for Choosing a Secure and Reliable Payment Method for Global Businesses As a global business, finding a reliable payment method is crucial to ensuring your transactions are seamless and secure. According to the data collected by Trading Platforms, the digital payments sector is projected to experience significant growth of 15% year-over-year, reaching an estimated total transaction value of approximately $9.5 trillion by 2023. With so many International payment options available, choosing the right one for your business needs can be overwhelming. However, taking the time to research and compare different payment methods can save you both time and money in the long run. When choosing a payment method, consider transaction fees, processing time, and currency conversion rates. It's also essential to select a payment method accepted in the countries where you do business. For example, if you do business in China, it's vital to offer payment methods such as Alipay and WeChat Pay, which are the preferred payment options for Chinese consumers. Story continuesAnother crucial factor to consider is security. According to Verizon's 2019 Payment Security Report, only 36% of global organizations were fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. With the increasing threat of cybercrime, choosing a payment method that offers robust security features such as encryption and fraud detection is crucial. Additionally, it's essential to ensure that your payment processor has a good reputation and a track record of protecting its clients' financial information. The global payments industry experienced a remarkable rebound in 2021, surpassing pre-pandemic expectations and showcasing strong growth. According to McKinsey's recent report, the industry's revenue is projected to exceed $3 trillion by 2026. The Future of International Payment Solutions: Digital Currencies, Mobile Payments, Fraud Prevention, and AI Innovations Digital currencies and blockchain technology are revolutionizing the future of international payment solutions. The global market for blockchain technology is projected to reach a staggering value of $57,641.3 million by the year 2025, reflecting a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69.4% during the period from 2019 to 2025, with the finance sector being the largest adopter of this technology. These innovations provide faster and more secure cross-border transactions, making them highly appealing to businesses and consumers. On the other hand, mobile payment solutions will become even more prevalent as consumers increasingly rely on their smartphones to purchase and transfer money. This trend will continue as mobile devices become more advanced and ubiquitous. According to Business of Apps, mobile payments transaction volume reached $1.7 billion in 2021, a 27% annual increase. Moreover, in the international payment solutions industry, there will be a growing focus on transparency, compliance, and fraud prevention. According to Digital 360, U.S.-based e-commerce merchants saw a 24.2% increase in monthly fraud attempts, reaching 344 in 2020 compared to 277 in 2019. However, the prevention rate declined to 34.3% in 2020, with 118 cases successfully stopped, compared to a 56.3% prevention rate in 2019, where 156 fraud attempts were prevented. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will also play an increasingly important role in international payment solutions, helping companies to detect and prevent fraud, automate processes, and improve customer service. A study by Juniper Research estimated that AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants in banking would save businesses over $8 billion per year by 2022. Innovation in payment methods and technologies will continue to drive the industry forward, with new solutions emerging to meet the evolving needs of businesses and consumers worldwide. From biometric authentication to virtual currencies, there will be no shortage of exciting developments.15 PayPal Alternatives For International PaymentsOur Methodology Our methodology for identifying PayPal alternatives for international payments involved conducting thorough research using sources such as Tipalti, Software Testing Help, Oberlo, and Indeed.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Procter &amp; GambleIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Jon Moeller, sold US$4.5m worth of shares at a price of US$149 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$147. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Procter &amp; Gamble insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

In total, insiders dumped US$4.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Procter &amp; Gamble Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Procter &amp; Gamble insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$196m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Procter &amp; Gamble Tell Us?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

For instance, in 2022, Chile, the country with the largest copper reserves, saw its mining sector contribute over 14% to its GDP, with copper accounting for a considerable percentage of export revenues.According to The World Copper Factbook 2022, released by The International Copper Study Group (ICSG), Chile emerged as a preeminent figure in 2021, responsible for a substantial fraction of the world's copper output. The country contributed to nearly one-third of the total copper mine production globally, with a prodigious yield of 5.6 million metric tons of copper in 2021. This significant copper throughput can be attributed to Chile's vast mineral reserves and robust mining industry infrastructure. If you wish to understand which countries are banking well on their copper reserves, we have already covered the Top 15 Copper Producing Countries; give them a read for a better perspective. Story continuesThe Peruvian copper mining industry demonstrated considerable progress in the latter half of the last decade, starting from 2015. This period was marked by a notable surge in the country's copper output, which, in turn, led to Peru accounting for a remarkable 10.8% of the world's copper mine production by 2021. Irrespective of Peru's uptick in identifying new copper reserves, the country's concession system is a hindrance to new investments in the mining sector. It is also noteworthy that Chile and Peru's impressive growth in copper production has altered the dynamics of global copper supply as the United States and European countries plan to diversify their mineral imports from mainland China. World's Copper Mining Capacity Chile's Escondida mine has a copper mining capacity of 1,510 thousand metric tons, which is the world's highest as of 2022. The Escondida mine is largely owned by BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) (57.5%) and Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) (30%) and is primarily a copper porphyry deposit. Closely following Escondida mine, the Grasberg copper mine, also owned by Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX), in Indonesia, has a copper mining capacity of 800 thousand metric tons. Morenci (also the 4th largest mine by capacity) and Safford mines in Arizona, owned by Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX), also experienced a surge in copper production in 2022. The most significant increase in copper mine throughput in the US was at The Bingham Canyon Mine, owned by Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), in 2022, as its recovery rates were higher this year.Antamania copper mine Chile operated by BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), stands as the 7th largest copper mine in terms of throughput capacity as its capacity is 450 thousand metric tons. Are Copper Reserves Dwindling Worldwide? How Long Will Copper Reserves Last?As per ICSG data, copper mining capacity is expected to hit 31.2 million tons by 2026, as the use of refined copper is on an upward trajectory. For instance, copper consumption reached 25.3 million metric tons in 2021 (up from 500,000 tons in 1990) and is only rising. Mines like The Bingham Canyon Mine, owned by Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), the Safford mines in Arizona, owned by Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX), and Escondida Mine, largely owned by BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) have a big share in the mining capacity. Since the average compound annual growth for copper growth has been 3.3%, it poses an intensive question: are copper reserves depleting in the near future? According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) data spanning from 1960 onwards, at any given time, an average of 40 years' worth of copper reserves has been consistently maintained. Moreover, the global repository of copper is not solely reliant on the original ore reserves. Complementary strategies such as copper recycling, cutting-edge innovations, and continuous mining explorations have been persistently reinforcing the longevity of copper's availability. While the modern technological era has incited an amplified demand for copper extracted from ore, the expansion of known reserves has seemingly kept pace with this trend. Evidence of this phenomenon is the expansion of reserves over the two decades from 2000 to 2021. Despite the extraction of 373 million tons of copper in this period, the reserves witnessed an augmentation by 447 million tons, resulting in a current total of 890,000 million metric tons of copper, according to USGS data.A 2015 USG study states that identified worldwide copper reserves are 2.1 billion tons, while the untapped resources are estimated to be 3.5 billion tons. This expansion of reserves manifests the outcomes of continued exploration, advancements in mining technology, and the dynamic economics of mining operations. But aside from the tapped and untapped copper reserves, the resource constraints in copper production are alarming. Owing to limited copper inventories the countries can mine and production shortages, the copper shortfall could reach around 20% of the consumption by 2035, which was only 2% in 2021. We have explained this subject in detail while covering 15 Biggest Copper Companies in the World; give it a read for more in-depth knowledge.20 Countries With The Largest Copper Reserves In The WorldCopyright: tomas1111 / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology USGS publishes annual mineral commodity summaries to furnish government estimates on minerals.
