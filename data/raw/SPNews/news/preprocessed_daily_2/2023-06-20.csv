2,5663efdf-cf3a-3d77-bea4-3fbd7438cab7,CTAS,2023-06-20,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Cintas (CTAS),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-164503021.html,1687193103,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Cintas (CTAS) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this uniform rental company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Cintas is 15.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 9.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 7.1%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Cintas is 6.5%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -0.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 18.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Cintas have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Cintas a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Cintas is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, sales seem to be rebounding now, as the latest report from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) reflects a jump in semiconductor sales in April.Predictions were that semiconductor sales would hit bottom by the end of the first quarter before making a steady recovery. The latest sales figures hint at that. Although challenges remain aplenty, demand for semiconductors is expected to be robust, fueled by the development of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and the Internet of Things.Semiconductor Sales ReboundAccording to the latest report from SIA, global semiconductor sales totaled $40 billion in April, up 0.3% from March’s total of $39.8 billion. Semiconductor sales seem to be finally rebounding, as predicted earlier.However, the recovery is expected to be slow and steady. On a year-over-year basis, semiconductor sales declined 21.6% in April.The semiconductor industry saw sales hitting record highs during the pandemic as millions worked remotely. Surging demand for electronic goods and indoor entertainment like video games had fueled sales, while lockdown-induced halts in shipment imposed industry-wide supply-chain challenges.Higher demand coupled with a shortage in microchip supply created turmoil in multiple end-user industries like automobiles, power, lighting and electronics. As the supply-chain crisis started getting resolved, demand slowed. This saw the sales curve moving up and down throughout 2022.Besides, a combination of interrelated factors, including increasing prices, geopolitical tensions, and the lingering effects of the pandemic, contributed to the temporary downturn. These elements impacted consumer spending, created macroeconomic uncertainty and led to fluctuations in demand for semiconductors.However, 2022 emerged to be the best year for the chip industry. According to SIA, global semiconductor sales jumped 3.2% to $573.5 billion in 2022 from $555.9 billion in 2021.Story continuesThe industry is poised to rebound and grow in 2023. According to the latest forecast by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, annual global semiconductor sales are projected to decrease 10.3% in 2023 and rebound with growth of 11.9% or $576 billion in 2024.Stocks to WatchGiven the bright prospect for the industry, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks. Below are four chip stocks that investors can gain from in the near term.NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms. NVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, necessary to run deep-learning algorithms.NVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 33.4%.

This week, energy traders are seeing oil weakness emerge on disappointing stimulus efforts,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at data and analytics firm OANDA.China cut its benchmark loan prime rates (LPR) for the first time in 10 months, with a smaller-than-expected 10-basis-point reduction in the five-year LPR.The rate reduction followed recent economic data showing China's retail and factory sectors were struggling to sustain momentum from earlier this year.""Oil traders may need to see a materialised strong economic rebound in China to improve their outlook on oil demand,"" said Tina Teng at CMC Markets in Auckland.An expert at China National Petroleum's (CNPC) research arm said China's crude demand will grow less than previously expected as strong interest for electric vehicles weighs on gasoline use.China's fuel oil imports dipped in May after hitting a decade high in April, while exports of low-sulphur marine fuels rose, General Administration of Customs data showed.Story continuesThe Chinese government met last week to discuss measures to spur economic growth and several major banks cut their 2023 economic growth forecasts for China amid fears that its post-COVID recovery is faltering.Despite forecasts for less growth in oil demand, consumption in both China and India are still expected to rise in coming months.Analysts at Eurasia Group, a consultancy, said ""Demand growth may get a boost in the second half if Beijing introduces new stimulus measures to bolster economic expansion.""""India’s booming aviation sector will also contribute to overall demand growth,"" analysts at Eurasia said.India dominated the Paris Airshow as Air India finalised a huge order for 470 planes from Airbus SE and Boeing Co.On the supply side, Iran's crude exports and oil output have hit new highs this year despite U.S. sanctions.Russia is also set to increase seaborne diesel and gasoil exports this month, outweighing cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia itself.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino in New York; Additional reporting by Noah Browning in London, Katya Golubkova in Tokyo and Andrew Hayley in Beijing; Editing by David Goodman, Matthew Lewis, Jonathan Oatis and Nick Zieminski)]"

The two sectors have failed to recover despite the lifting of anti-COVID restrictions earlier this year.Fed in focus as Powell testimony loomsAnticipation of a testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kept oil markets antsy this week, with Powell likely to offer up more cues on U.S. interest rates and the economy when he speaks before Congress on Wednesday.The prospect of rising U.S. rates also weighed heavily on crude this year, as traders remained concerned that worsening economic conditions, amid tight monetary policy, could dent oil demand.Story continuesU.S. supply is expected to tighten in the near-term, especially as fuel demand increases and as U.S. energy firms reduced the number of operational oil rigs for a seventh straight month.But the prospect of a U.S. recession, buoyed by weak economic indicators from the country, largely offset any optimism over tighter supply.Global crude supplies also remain high despite recent production cuts from Saudi Arabia. Recent reports suggested that Iranian crude exports hit five-month highs in May, while Russian crude shipments to major Asian importers - India and China - remained robust through the month.Related ArticlesOil prices dip as markets weigh China rate cut, weak economic outlookGold trades sideways, copper dips as China cuts ratesU.S. NHC says 50% chance of cyclone near Cape Verde Islands]"

When a fire forced an American gas plant to close, strikes clogged French oil terminals, Russia demanded Europe pay for fuel in roubles or the weather looked grimmer than usual, markets went wild. Since January, however, things have been different (see chart). Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has hovered around $75 a barrel, compared with $120 a year ago; in Europe, gas prices, at €35 ($38) per megawatt-hour (mwh), are 88% below their peak in August.It is not that the news has suddenly become more amenable. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (opec) and its allies have announced swingeing cuts to output. In America the number of oil and gas rigs has fallen for seven weeks in a row, as producers respond to the meagre rewards on offer. Several of Norway’s gas facilities—now vital to Europe—are in prolonged maintenance. The Netherlands is closing the largest gas field in Europe. Yet any uptick in price quickly fades away. What is keeping prices down?Disappointing demand may be part of the answer. In recent months expectations for global economic growth have been slashed. The failure of several banks this spring raised fears of an imminent recession in America. Inflation is battering consumers in Europe. In both places, the full impact of interest-rate rises is still to be felt. Meanwhile, in China, the post-covid rebound is proving much weaker than expected. Anaemic growth, in turn, is dampening demand for fuel.Yet look closer and the demand story does not entirely convince. Despite its disappointing recovery, China consumed 16m barrels per day (b/d) of crude in April, a record. A rebound in trucking, tourism and travel since the grim zero-covid period means more diesel, petrol and jet fuel is being used. In America, a 30% drop in petrol prices compared with a year ago augurs well for the summer driving season. In Asia and Europe, high temperatures are expected to last, creating more demand for gas-fired power generation for cooling.Story continuesA more convincing explanation can be found on the supply side of the equation. The past two years of high prices have incentivised production outside of opec, which is now coming online. Oil is gushing from the Atlantic basin, through a combination of conventional wells (in Brazil and Guyana) and shale and tar-sands production (in America, Argentina and Canada). Norway is pumping more, too. JPMorgan Chase, a bank, estimates that non-opec output will rise by 2.2m b/d in 2023.In theory, this should be balanced by production cuts announced in April by core opec members (of 1.2m b/d) and Russia (of 500,000 b/d), to which Saudi Arabia added another 1m b/d in June. Yet output in these countries has not fallen by as much as promised—and other opec countries are increasing exports. Venezuela’s are up, thanks to investment by Chevron, an American giant. Iran’s are at their highest since 2018, when America imposed fresh sanctions. Indeed, a fifth of the world’s oil now comes from countries under Western embargoes, selling at a discount and thus helping dampen prices.For gas, the supply situation is trickier: the main Russian pipeline delivering to Europe remains shut. But Freeport lng, a facility which handles a fifth of America’s exports of liquefied natural gas, and was harmed by an explosion last year, is back online. Russia’s other exports to continental Europe continue. Norwegian flows will fully resume in mid-July. Most important, Europe’s existing stocks are vast. The bloc’s storage facilities are 73% full, compared with 53% a year ago, and on track to reach their 90% target before December. Rich Asian countries, such as Japan and South Korea, also have plenty of gas.When inflation was soaring and interest rates remained modest, commodities, notably crude oil, were an attractive hedge against rising prices, pushing up prices as investors flooded in. Now that speculators expect inflation to drop, the appeal has dimmed—just as higher rates make safer assets like cash and bonds more alluring. As a result, speculative net positioning (the balance between long and short bets placed by punters on futures oil markets) has slumped. Higher rates also raise the opportunity cost of holding crude stocks, so physical traders are offloading their stock. The volume in floating storage fell from 80m barrels in January to 65m barrels in April, its lowest since early 2020.Prices could well rise later in the year. The International Energy Agency, an official forecaster, projects that global oil demand will reach a record 102.3m b/d over 2023. Oil supply, too, will hit a record, but the forecaster reckons the market will tip into deficit into the second half of 2023—a view shared by many banks. As winter approaches, competition for lng cargoes between Asia and Europe will intensify. Freight rates for the winter are already rising in anticipation.Still, last year’s nightmare is unlikely to be repeated. Many analysts expect Brent crude to stay close to $80 a barrel and not to reach triple digits. Gas futures markets in Asia and Europe point to a 30% rise from today’s levels by the autumn, rather than anything more extreme. Over the past 12 months commodity markets have adapted. It now takes more than a hint of bad news to send prices rocketing.© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.From The Economist, published under licence.

24,c2899848-d052-3490-b8db-9fde9a0e9f41,NWS,2023-06-20,Wall Street Analysts Believe News Corp. (NWSA) Could Rally 30.45%: Here's is How to Trade,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-believe-news-135506699.html,1687182906.0,STORY,"['TGT', 'NWSA']","[Shares of News Corp. (NWSA) have gained 5.3% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $19.57, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $25.53 indicates a potential upside of 30.5%.The mean estimate comprises four short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $3.66. While the lowest estimate of $21.10 indicates a 7.8% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 53.3% to reach $30. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.But, for NWSA, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in NWSAAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, two estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 11.5%.Moreover, NWSA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NWSA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In attendance is everyone from Twitter's new CEO Linda Yaccarino (and reportedly her new billionaire boss, Elon Musk) to Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel to Spotify founder Daniel Ek. And of course, Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone is in the house crushing it.We have some potentially stock-price-moving interviews kicking off this morning, so I encourage you to tune in and follow the Yahoo Finance Twitter feed.morning brief imageWith that promo out of the way, I'm here to tell you that after 48 hours on the ground in the Continent, I can definitively say that the AI hype bubble has traveled across the pond.""Isn't this supposed to be an ad industry event, not Techcrunch Disrupt 2023,"" has been one of my main thoughts up to now.Buff glistening people — presumably part of the conference in some sort of capacity — are running on along the picturesque beach with AI mentions on t-shirts.Snapchat is out hyping its various AI and VR efforts in a full-building takeover in front of the beach (so much for the struggling social media platform watching its cost structure).Meta has one of the larger presences (again, so much for Zuck's ""Year of Efficiency"") at the event from what I can tell — Amazon is probably the largest — and continues to promote new WhatsApp features and what it's doing in AI.Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Brad Smith speak with investor and musician Will.I.Am on all things AI. at Cannes Lions. (Yahoo Finance)Pinterest will no doubt discuss its AI efforts (more on those here from a recent chat I had with new CEO Bill Ready who is also in attendance) at its beach house just a few rows down from Yahoo and Google's YouTube.AI is a topic of interest at most panel discussions, with a keen focus on how the technology will shape the advertising industry.Story continuesIt's AI mania at yet another event for me this year — I can't outrun the stuff!And you, the investor, can't outrun it either.Mere mentions of new AI tools from various tech companies continue to prop up stock prices — and the broader S&amp;P 500. Food companies are playing up the potential of AI on earnings calls. Food companies!Companies are taking great pains have their marketing and investor relations departments pump up AI in external forums.This is all getting crazy.I am not saying generative AI is internet bubble type of stuff — it has true game-changing promise for companies and by extension their profits. But how freely AI is being talked about is becoming a red flag for me from an investment standpoint. When everyone is doing something in investing, it's often wise to question it and consider doing the opposite.My advice: check your valuations on any company discussing AI, make sure said company is profitable and generating cash and question if what they are working on with respect to AI is truly fresh.Two great examples of fresh AI projects besides Microsoft and Google are AMD and Salesforce, in my view.As for me, it's back to the French Riviera...and the AI hype bubble.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.77 billion, suggesting an increase of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to NoteDarden’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from improvement in same-restaurant sales across its brands, business model enhancements and menu simplifications.

However, sales at Other business is pegged at $519.6 million, indicating a decline of 5.8% from the prior-year quarter.Despite solid cost control, higher labor expenses due to increased wages may have weighed on profits in the quarter to be reported.

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) today released its first Human Rights Report, detailing the company’s strategy to promote, respect, and protect human rights, and its progress to date in implementing its Human Rights Commitment.PMI’s Human Rights Commitment is the cornerstone of its human rights strategy. It outlines the foundational principles that need to be respected throughout the operations and value chain, by both PMI and its business partners. In 2022, PMI updated its Commitment with the company’s latest saliency mapping, sustainability materiality assessment, ongoing due diligence activities, and the evolution of the company’s sustainability strategy.""Establishing a strong foundation and integrating mechanisms into our organization that promote, respect, and protect human rights are an essential part of our approach to business,"" said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer. ""While this can be challenging given the breadth of our operations and the scope and complexity of the issues involved, we believe human rights are an absolute and universal requirement that we are committed to upholding.""In its Human Rights Report, PMI shares its best practices, lessons learned, main challenges, and future actions. It also features country-based case studies and external recognition—such as the inclusion of PMI’s Agricultural Labor Practices in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s (WBCSD) latest Human Rights Progress Report. PMI actively participates in the Business Commission to Tackle Inequality’s (BCTI) efforts and contributed to the latest report on Tackling Inequality: An agenda for business action.In addition, PMI’s Human Rights Report includes progress toward achieving its 2025 goal to conduct 10 human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) in the highest risk countries. To date—PMI has completed seven HRIAs, including two in 2022 in Brazil and Malaysia. Read more about PMI’s HRIAs here.Story continuesPMI’s approach to human rights is grounded in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business &amp; Human Rights (UNGPs), and the strategy is centered on four pillars:A sound framework: PMI’s human rights work is governed by PMI’s Human Rights Commitment, which is implemented by other PMI policy instruments such as the company’s Code of Conduct. Raising awareness on those instruments helps PMI embed an ethos of respect for human rights within its corporate culture.Rigorous due diligence: PMI has robust programs and processes in place to identify adverse impacts across its value chain.Remediation: If adverse impacts do occur, PMI strives to ensure access to grievance mechanisms.Transparency: Reporting transparently on PMI’s progress and challenges through its annual reporting and targeted communications is a vital component of its approach.""Human rights are inherent to the dignity of human life and a prerequisite for society to prosper,"" said Jennifer Motles, Chief Sustainability Officer. ""As a global company, we work to uphold human rights both within our organization and across our value chain. We will continue to work with different parts of society in a multi-stakeholder approach to achieve sustainable solutions that comprehensively address systemic human rights issues"".To read PMI’s Human Rights Report visit www.pmi.com/human-rights-report.

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of March 31, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 78 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 18.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35% of PMI’s total 2023 first-quarter net revenues.

38,d1342779-ea17-33a6-b7b6-60a17ca5e0e0,SPG,2023-06-20,Is It Wise to Retain Simon Property (SPG) Stock Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wise-retain-simon-property-spg-142100640.html,1687184460,STORY,"['SPG', 'AKR']","[Amid the recovery of the retail real estate industry, Simon Property Group’s SPG portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad, the adoption of omnichannel retailing and balance sheet strength position it well for growth.This retail REIT behemoth enjoys wide exposure to retail assets across the United States. Additionally, its presence in international markets is likely to encourage sustainable long-term growth compared with its domestically focused peers.Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers has paid off well. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omnichannel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. It is also focused on tapping growth opportunities by helping digital brands enhance their brick-and-mortar presence.Further, SPG’s efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, have enabled it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play. Going forward, an improving leasing environment is likely to benefit this retail REIT’s properties at premium locations. We expect the company’s 2023 total revenues to improve 2.1% year over year.To enhance its portfolio, Simon Property has been focusing on premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments and has invested billions in transforming its properties. Moreover, the company capitalized on buying recognized retail brands in bankruptcy. With the brands generating a decent amount from digital sales, investments in them seem strategic for SPG.Simon Property also maintains a solid balance sheet position with ample liquidity. This enabled the company to exit the first quarter of 2023 with $9.3 billion of liquidity.As of Mar 31, 2023, Simon Property’s total secured debt to total assets was 19%, while the fixed-charge coverage ratio was 4.6, ahead of the required level. The company also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, giving it favorable access to the debt market. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it remains well-poised to tide over any mayhem and bank on growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticements for REIT investors, and Simon Property is committed to boosting shareholder wealth. During the pandemic, while several REITs suspended dividend payouts, Simon Property continued with its dividend payout though at a reduced rate.Later, the company announced dividend hikes, with the most recent one being declared concurrent with the first-quarter 2023 earnings release, whereby the company increased the dividend payment to $1.85 per share from $1.80 paid out earlier. This marked a sequential hike of 2.8% and a year-over-year increase of 8.8%. This spate of dividend increases brings additional relief to investors and reaffirms confidence in this retail landlord.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 6.4% in the past month compared with its industry’s growth of 5.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, with the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. However, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to continue to be a popular choice among customers. Consequently, this might adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores and affect retail REITs, including Simon Property.Moreover, amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-interest rate environment, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent.A high-interest rate environment is a concern for Simon Property. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden, and its share of total debt as of Mar 31, 2023 was approximately $32.1 billion.Our estimate for 2023 interest expenses implies a rise of 6% year over year. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts due to high interest rates.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Acadia Realty Trust AKR and Saul Centers BFS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Acadia Realty Trust’s 2023 FFO per share has been revised marginally north over the past two months to $1.23.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Saul Centers’ 2023 FFO per share has been revised 2 cents north over the past month to $3.05.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents FFO — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NVRO is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its research and development (R&amp;D) edge. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and continued strength in its flagship Senza platform are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and dependence on third-party payors persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 40.3% against the 20.2% rise of the industry and 19.9% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $901.9 million. The company projects 31.5% growth for 2024 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Nevro’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average earnings surprise being 5.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.R&amp;D Edge: Nevro aims to continue to improve patient outcomes and expand patient access to HF10 therapy through enhancements to Senza and the development of newer indications, raising our optimism. Since the launch of the initial Senza system, the company introduced a number of product enhancements, like active anchors with improved performance, among others. The company continues to make enhancements to Senza to boost its performance.On the first-quarter earnings call in April, Nevro’s management stated that the company submitted the two-year data from its non-surgical back pain trial for publication.Strength in Senza: We are optimistic about Nevro’s continued strength in its flagship Senza platform. Based on analysis from the company’s SENZA- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and European studies, as well as the SENZA-PDN (Painful Diabetic Neuropathy) and SENZA-NSRBP (non-surgical refractory back pain) RCTs, Nevro believes the 10 kHz therapy can be an attractive treatment option for patients.In March, Nevro initiated the full-market release of the Senza HFX iQ System in the United States, which has received favorable feedback from physicians and patients.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Nevro’s better-than-expected first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company recorded an improvement in overall top-line results and robust domestic revenues. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures was also witnessed. The improvement in U.S. PDN trial procedures is also encouraging.DownsidesDependence on Third-Party Payors: Nevro’s success in marketing its products largely depends on whether U.S. and international government health administrative authorities, private health insurers and other organizations adequately cover and reimburse customers for the cost of its products. Access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for spinal cord stimulation procedures using Senza by third-party payors is essential for the acceptance of Nevro’s products by its customers.Stiff Competition: Nevro operates in a highly competitive medical device industry, which is subject to technological change. The company’s success depends partly upon its ability to establish a competitive position in the neuromodulation market by securing broad market acceptance of its HF10 therapy and Senza products for the treatment of approved chronic pain conditions.Estimate TrendNevro has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss has widened from $2.43 per share to $2.51.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $109.8 million, suggesting a 5.4% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past year, Hologic has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 20.7% compared with the industry’s 17.9% rise.Hologic delivered better-than-expected revenues and earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company’s Breast Health segment registered strong growth, driven by improving semiconductor chip supply, which enabled additional gantry deliveries within the quarter. This resulted in higher capital equipment revenues compared to the prior year period.Hologic has been making impressive progress in its Breast Health arm in recent times. The company is currently focusing on expanding its strategy to diversify its business across the patient continuum of care. It has also launched new software products based on its investments in artificial intelligence and strengthened its interventional franchise via the Brevera relaunch.Hologic, Inc. PriceHologic, Inc. PriceHologic, Inc. price | Hologic, Inc. QuoteThe GYN Surgical business grew organically as the company registered procedural volumes return and acceleration from new business lines. Moreover, the company raised the 2023 guidance, raising optimism about the stock.In Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continued to register strong growth during the fiscal second quarter. The growth was driven by the BV and CV/TV vaginitis panels and aided by the core sexually transmitted infection (STI) menu, including Clemidiagonrhia, Human papillomavirus (HPV) and Trichomoniasis. The company witnessed strong contributions from Biotheranostics and the respiratory menu on Panther Fusion during the quarter.In order to streamline its operations and reduce cost of revenues, Hologic has been adopting a few significant strategies over the past few years. The company has invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where management has recognized a good return. These include Hologic’s Genius marketing campaign in Breast Health, cervical cancer co-testing initiatives in Diagnostics, along with efforts to gain competitive market share with NovaSure. Per management, these strategic initiatives are already paying off through increased brand awareness, market share gains, and price stability, all of which will contribute to the company’s higher sales.On the flip side, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Hologic witnessed a year-over-year decline in both revenues and earnings were significantly down. The significant decline in COVID-19 assay revenues dragged total revenues down. It also reported a contraction in both margins, which looks discouraging.Story continuesThe company-provided adjusted gross margin contracted 890 basis points during the quarter. According to the company, the downside in gross margin was primarily due to a year-over-year decline in COVID-19 assay sales. The company’s adjusted operating margin contracted 1610 bps.We remain worried about the significant challenges Hologic faces owing to unfavorable foreign currency.

Year to date, product lines across the vaccine business were up 9% in the fiscal third quarter, with notable growth in the Latin America region. Progress in the development pipeline of Companion Animal is encouraging. The expansion of Phibro’s business in key growth regions also buoys optimism.However, operating in a tough competitive space amid continued macroeconomic headwinds is concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 21.2% compared with the 18.1% fall of the industry and a 22.1% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned animal health and mineral nutrition company has a market capitalization of $559.8 million. PAHC carries an earnings yield of 8.97%, against the industry’s yield of -2.31%. Phibro delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 7.01% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayA Diversified Product Portfolio: Phibro’s key animal health products, which comprise MFAs (Medicated Feed Additives) and nutritional specialty products, facilitate enhancing animal nutrition. In the fiscal third quarter, the company witnessed the increased demand for MFAs in the United States and Latin America and Canada, along with the growing demand for processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry.In the last reported quarter, growth in nutritional specialties was led by higher domestic demand and higher selling prices for dairy products, along with growth in the companion animal product, Rejensa. The vaccine product business growth was driven by new registrations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA Prospering Vaccine Business: PAHC is focusing on new developments along with incremental registrations and the growing volumes of vaccine technologies. The company makes significant investments to expand vaccine manufacturing capacity at several locations.In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Phibro registered a 15% improvement in vaccine net sales, driven by increased demand and new product launches in Latin America.Story continuesPotential in Emerging Markets: Phibro’s existing operations and distribution network in more than 75 countries pave the path for global growth opportunities. Outside the United States, Phibro’s global footprint extends to countries where the livestock production growth rate is expected to be higher than the average growth rate. This includes Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Asia Pacific, Russia and former CIS countries, Mexico, Turkey, Australia, Canada, South Africa and other countries in Africa.DownsidesMacroeconomic Headwinds Mar Growth in Q3: Macroeconomic and operational challenges continue to dent Phibro’s profitability. In the fiscal third quarter, supply-chain disruptions were less common but still occurred. Meanwhile, PAHC posted a year-over-year decline in earnings. Higher SG&amp;A expenses negatively weighed on the company’s operating margin in the quarter under review.A Tough Competitive Landscape: Phibro’s competitive position is based principally on its product registrations, customer service and support, breadth of the product line, product quality, manufacturing technology, facility location, and product prices. A few of the company’s principal competitors include Bayer AG, Boehringer Ingelheim International GMBH, Eli Lilly and Company (Elanco Animal Health), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (Merck Animal Health and MSD Animal Health) and Zoetis Inc.Moreover, consolidation continues to rise in the animal health market.  This might work in favor of Phibro’s competitors.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Phibro’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $1.24 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $982.4 million.

He will also meet Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Thursday to discuss the video streaming market.But while Korean shows are hugely popular on Netflix, with 60% of global users watching at least one title last year, calls are growing for the government to support locally funded projects and secure the rights for content.The government last week announced plans to provide 500 billion won ($390.09 million) to help local streaming platforms compete with global rivals such as Netflix amid soaring production costs.""The media and content industry will thrive when various platforms compete instead of being dominated by only a few, which will benefit both creators and consumers,"" said Heo Seung, public affairs director at South Korean streaming platform Watcha.South Korea exported $13 billion worth of content in 2022 including video games, music and broadcasting, according to the Korea Economic Research Institute, eclipsing electric vehicle and rechargeable battery shipments.The ""Netflix Effect"", a term coined for the phenomenon that launches actors and directors from obscurity to instant stardom when their shows appear on the platform, is a part of South Korea's success.Against this backdrop, President Yoon Suk Yeol welcomed Netflix’s $2.5 billion investment as a ""big opportunity"" for both South Korea and the U.S. streaming giant.Story continuesNetflix's market weight in South Korea dwarfs that of local platforms such as Tving, Wavve and Watcha.In 2022, the U.S. firm reported an operating profit of 14.28 billion won in South Korea, a stark contrast to Tving's operating loss of 119 billion won.Netflix boasted a 38.2% market share in South Korea last year, according to Mobile Index, overshadowing Tving's 13.1%.Unlike the EU, South Korea does not have laws requiring foreign streaming services to produce or invest in local content.That has prompted some Korean politicians to call for Netflix to better reward creators when their projects succeed.Netflix said it aims to compensate local creators fairly at the initial production stage, regardless of how well their shows perform.""Compensation is an important part of that, but so is the creative expression our local team supports, along with the global audience reach of our service,"" a Netflix spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Creators who have worked with Netflix say the company has taken a chance on them when others did not. ""Squid Game"" creator Hwang Dong-hyuk said in various interviews in 2021 the series was rejected multiple times before being picked up by Netflix.Aditya Thayi, a London-based filmmaker who directed upcoming Netflix documentary ""King of Clones"", told Reuters Netflix is changing the game by ""evening the playing field for Asian filmmakers.""While the project was commissioned by Netflix UK, it centres on genetic cloning fraud in South Korea and includes file clips from broadcasters’ archives. Such footage alone can cost up to$40,000 to acquire, Thayi said, making it prohibitively expensive for independent producers without funding.Lim Jong-soo, a professor at Sejong University, said Netflix has given South Korean producers more opportunities but that the government could do more to help, such as by securing IP rights for creators.""The government needs to come up with a system to ensure that excess profits can be returned to South Korean creators.""($1 = 1,281.7400 won)(Reporting by Hyunsu Yim; Editing by Sam Holmes)]"

The decision positions Newmont to prioritize other value-accretive opportunities and support its disciplined capital allocation strategy, which balances steady reinvestment in the business, maintaining financial strength and flexibility and providing leading returns to shareholders.""Once complete, our proposed acquisition of Newcrest will create an industry-leading portfolio of Tier 1 operations and deepen our unmatched pipeline of value-accretive projects,"" said Tom Palmer, President and CEO of Newmont. ""In connection with this transaction and our strategy to create lasting value, we are targeting at least $2 billion in near-term cash flow improvements through portfolio optimization within the first two years. The deferral of the Yanacocha Sulfides project represents the first step in delivering on this target, as we evaluate further opportunities to resequence project capital and rationalize the combined portfolio to build a more profitable and resilient future for the business.""The deferral of the full-funds investment decision results in a reduction of development capital expenditures, including an estimated $300 million included in Newmont’s outlook for 20242. The decision to defer the Project is based on a robust analysis led by Dean Gehring, Chief Development Officer – Peru, over the last nine months to further maximize the Project’s economics in a period of high global inflation and market volatility. This analysis and investment to date will be integral to preparing for a full-funds decision, and will continue to support the Project when construction resumes.Story continuesMr. Palmer continued, ""Newmont has a long history of operating in Peru, and Yanacocha is core to Newmont’s portfolio and long-term strategy. With the potential to operate as a Tier 13 gold and copper mine for several decades, we remain committed to managing Yanacocha’s operations and closure activities safely and responsibly. We will continue to work closely with government stakeholders, business partners and local communities in Peru as we prepare for a future investment decision on the Sulfides Project.""Dean Gehring will now shift his focus from leading the Yanacocha operation and Sulfides project to leading integration planning for Newmont’s proposed acquisition of Newcrest. In this role as Chief Integration Officer, Dean will lead key activities required for a safe and smooth integration, while setting up the organization for ongoing success.The Yanacocha Sulfides Project4The Yanacocha Sulfides project aims to develop the first phase of sulfide deposits at Yanacocha through an integrated processing circuit, including an autoclave to produce 45 percent gold, 45 percent copper and 10 percent silver. The first phase focuses on developing the Yanacocha Verde and Chaquicocha deposits to extend Yanacocha’s operations beyond 2040, with second and third phases having the potential to extend the operation’s life for multiple decades.ABOUT NEWMONTNewmont is the world’s leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc and lead.

In particular, the data reveals that job seekers are incurring more time before they finally ink employment contracts. That’s not exactly a hopeful sign.In addition, the other problems that society faces – such as stubbornly high inflation and rising corporate layoffs – bode rather poorly for stability and consumer confidence. With the precious metals representing safe-haven assets, investors may be able to mitigate potential ambiguities with gold stocks for dividend growth. Of course, the passive income component is always relevant and even more so for this present juncture. Therefore, market participants may enjoy the best of both worlds with the top gold stocks for dividends.GOLDBarrick Gold$16.81NEMNewmont$42.44BTGB2Gold$3.70InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBarrick Gold (GOLD)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comAmong the more popular names for top dividend gold stocks, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) is a mining firm that produces gold and copper. Per its public profile, Barrick features 16 operating sites in 13 countries. While a relevant enterprise, GOLD incurred some choppy trading. Since the beginning of this year, shares lost more than 5% of their equity value.Nevertheless, Barrick offers an intriguing idea for gold stocks for dividend growth. On the financial side, the company scores relatively well for profitability. Specifically, its trailing-year operating margin impresses at 24.64%, ranked above 84.86% of entities listed in the metals and mining industry. Also, its return on equity (ROE) pings at 0.36%, which actually beats out 79.15% of other miners.Regarding passive income, Barrick offers a solid (though not particularly generous) forward yield of 2.37%. However, what it lacks in outright generosity it makes up for with sustainability. Its payout ratio sits at 34.47%, which is encouraging. Overall, Barrick makes a conservative case for the best dividend-paying gold stocks.Story continuesNewmont (NEM)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA giant among the top dividend gold stocks, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) is the world’s leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc, and lead. According to its corporate profile, Newmont’s world-class portfolio of assets, prospects, and talent is anchored in favorable mining jurisdictions in North America, South America, Australia, and Africa. Despite its prominence, NEM shed more than 15% of its equity value.Still, for the intrepid investor, Newmont offers a chance to acquire one of the top gold stocks for dividends at a compelling discount. To be fair, the financial impact of the Covid-19 crisis did a number on the underlying business. Specifically, the company fell into the red due to lower realized gold prices. However, Newmont maintains an impressive operating margin of 11.1%, beating out 70.67% of its peers.On the passive income front, Newmont represents one of the high-dividend gold stocks with a forward yield of 3.81%. This handily beats out the material sector’s average yield of 2.82%. Still, investors should note that the payout ratio is a tad bit elevated at 59.08%.B2Gold (BTG)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockA popular speculative idea, B2Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:BTG) may surprise some onlookers because it’s also one of the top dividend gold stocks. We’ll get to that soon enough. According to its public profile, B2Gold is a low-cost international senior gold producer headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. It features operating gold mines in Mali, Namibia, and the Philippines. Priced at less than four bucks a share, BTG gained almost 4% since the start of the year.Financially, B2Gold’s main strengths lie in balance sheet stability and profitability. For the former, the company carries a favorably low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.02 times. Regarding the latter, the miner’s operating margin impresses at 32%, which ranks above 89.42% of competitors. Also, its net margin is 14.16%, beating out 79% of its peers.Moving onto passive income, the mining firm’s forward yield stands at 4.2%. Again, that’s well above the material sector’s average yield of 2.82%. Also, its payout ratio – while somewhat elevated – is quite reasonable at 52.57%. Thus, BTG makes a great case for top gold stocks for dividends.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

PDCO is expected to release fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jun 21, before the opening bell.The company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.33% in the last reported quarter. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same once, delivering an average surprise of 6.22%.Q4 EstimatesFor the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $1.66 billion, indicating a 1.1% increase from the prior-year period’s reported figure.The same for adjusted earnings per share is pinned at 70 cents, indicating a 1.4% decline from that recorded in the year-ago quarter.Factors to NoteAs one of the leading distributors of consumable products and dental technology, Patterson Companies’ Dental arm has been one of the key contributors to its top line. However, COVID-19 is likely to have impacted the company’s Dental business in fiscal fourth-quarter 2023.Per management, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, sales at this segment decreased 4.4% year over year. The decline was mainly due to moderation of sales of infection control products, which had witnessed strong demand during the pandemic. Moreover, persistent deflationary impact and unfavorable currency movement also hurt top-line growth in the last reported quarter. However, improved demand for digital equipment portfolio and continued momentum in the core equipment category benefited the segment’s revenues. These trends are likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.In the fiscal third quarter of 2023, sales in the Animal Health segment increased 2.6% on a year-over-year basis. According to management, this was driven by sales growth in both companion animal and production animal. These trends are expected to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter, boosting segmental sales.Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and ConsensusPatterson Companies, Inc. Price and ConsensusPatterson Companies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Patterson Companies, Inc. QuoteStory continuesThe Animal Health segment has been gaining from growth in pet adoptions and increased attention to pets. On the fiscal third-quarter 2023 earnings call, the companion animal business continued to show signs of prosperity and expected to gain from the long-term tailwinds of higher pet ownership in the past two years. Consequently, this trend is likely to get reflected in the fiscal fourth-quarter results.Apart from this, the company expects that the Animal Health business is well poised to drive its top line and, thereby, margins in the near term.During the fiscal third quarter, the company closed acquisition of all assets of Dairy Tech, expanding Animal Health’s suite of offerings. Patterson Companies did not disclose any financial terms for the deal yet. The impact of the acquisition on fourth-quarter sales is yet to be seen. On its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, we expect PDCO to provide the details of the deal's impact while announcing projections for fiscal 2024. Intense competition across most of the product lines and inflationary pressures might have weighed on the company’s overall fiscal fourth-quarter performance.What the Zacks Model UnveilsPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Tightening credit means recent-vintage loans should stabilize the market.SOUTHFIELD, Mich., June 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- With American households battling inflation and rising interest rates, auto lenders are seeing increased occurrences of auto-loan delinquencies - but almost entirely in the subprime segment.Source: AutoCreditInsight by S&amp;P Global Mobility, TransUnionSurpassing levels last seen during the Great Recession, account-level delinquency rates of auto loans 60+ days past due (DPD) have risen 26 basis points from Q1 2021's 1.43% to 1.69% in Q1 2023, according to a recent Credit Industry Insight Report (CIIR) by TransUnion.This has resulted in captive finance companies, banks, credit unions and independent lenders tightening underwriting standards on new- and used-vehicle loans to stem losses due to charge-offs, according to TransUnion/S&amp;P Global Mobility AutoCreditInsight.That said, there is nuance in the numbers, and TransUnion and S&amp;P Global Mobility analysts urged caution in drawing sensationalistic conclusions across the broader auto-financing market.The spike in delinquencies is not impacting a large slice of lenders - represented by OEM captive finance companies and major banks - doing near-prime, prime, prime-plus and super-prime originations. The brunt of the delinquencies is being felt by the independent lenders who operate in the subprime space and primarily lend for used-vehicle purchases.""The interest rate rise is squeezing the monthly budget for the average American consumer,"" said Jill Louden, product management associate director for S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""Consumers set aside money monthly for housing, vehicles, and insurance, but may not pay other obligations with the same frequency, such as medical bills and credit cards. People need their vehicles to get to work to make money and pay their obligations.""Here is where the nuance really comes in. ""Vintage performance"" - which reflects the performance of an account in different periods of time after the loan was originated - continues to show relatively strong results in the new-vehicle segment, with more recent vintages remaining at pandemic-era lows and performing better than the pre-pandemic portfolio at the same age.Story continuesAnd while the used-vehicle portfolio's vintage performance had a worse start out the gate in H1 2022, lenders reacted quickly to manage delinquencies - resulting in originations in the second half of '22 showing improved performance at the same vintage, according to the TransUnion report.""We continue to pay close attention to delinquencies, while seeing positive signs among vintage data,"" said Satyan Merchant, senior vice president and automotive business leader at TransUnion.The used-vehicle market is expected to remain tight, as the low level of new car sales starting in 2020 means fewer recent model-year used cars available, Merchant added. Going forward, affordability remains critical to consumers, particularly those with credit scores below prime.The tighter underwriting standards for auto loans, plus higher interest rates, combined with a renewed squeeze in used-car inventories and prices, have resulted in a decrease in loan originations. Originations for Q1 2023 are the lowest in four years: 5.87 million in Q1 2022 vs. Q1 2020 at 6.88 million, just as the pandemic started.As the pandemic struck in earnest, lenders began pulling back from the deteriorating subprime market as the shuttered economy triggered massive job losses. On average, subprime volume since the Great Recession of 2008-11 has held steady at around 15% of total outstanding loans - but dipped to 12.3% and 12.9% respectively in Q1 2021 and Q1 2022 before rebounding to 14.2% in Q1 2023.""Driven by lower inventories and higher interest rates, originations remain down from the same quarter a year ago,"" Merchant said. ""However, as production begins to catch up to demand, there is hope that this trend will reverse course soon, at least among new cars.""But if misery loves company, the U.S. automotive lending industry is not alone. Account delinquency rates since Q1 2021 have increased across most of the major lending products, except when mortgages which declined in 12 basis points (bps) in Q1 2022 and regained 11 bps in Q1 2023 to remain relatively flat from Q1 2021 to Q1 2023, according to the report.The tougher pills to swallow are the 60+ DPD account delinquency rates in bankcards and unsecured personal loans (UPL). In a two-year span since Q1 2021, the delinquency rate for the massive bankcard industry has risen 80 basis points from 0.99 percent to 1.79 percent. Meanwhile, in that same time span, UPLs have risen 110 basis points from 2.58 percent to 3.68 percent.About S&amp;P Global Mobility At S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in S&amp;P Global (SPGI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SPGI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?S&amp;P Global's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at S&amp;P Global's main business drivers. Incorporated in December 1925, S&amp;P Global Inc. is a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide.The company operates through six reportable segments: S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence (“Market Intelligence”), S&amp;P Global Ratings (“Ratings""), S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights (“Commodity Insights”), S&amp;P Global Mobility (“Mobility”), S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices (“Indices”) and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions (“Engineering Solutions”).Ratings (27% of total revenues in 2022): Ratings operates as an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, providing investors and other market participants with information, ratings and benchmarks. With offices in more than 25 countries globally, Ratings holds an important position in the world's financial infrastructure. Ratings’ revenues are differentiated between transaction and non-transaction revenues.Market Intelligence (34%): It helps investment professionals, government agencies, corporations and universities to track performance, generate alpha, identify investment ideas, understand competitive and industry dynamics, perform evaluations and assess credit risk. Desktop, Data Management Solutions and Risk Services are the business lines included in the segment.Commodity Insights (15%): Commodity Insights provides information and benchmark prices for commodity and energy markets. It helps producers, traders, energy and commodity market intermediaries with price data, analytics and industry insights, thereby enhancing transparency and efficiency in the market.Indices (12%): Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors. Indices mainly derives revenues from asset-linked fees based on the S&amp;P and Dow Jones indices and also from subscription and transaction revenues.Mobility (10%) &amp; Engineering Solutions (3%) which were acquired as a result of the IHS Markit buyout, serves two different sections of customers. Mobility serves vehicle manufacturers, automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies while Engineering Solutions serves technical professionalsStory continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in S&amp;P Global ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $7,221.09, or a 622.11% gain, as of June 19, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 171.07% and gold's return of 39.08% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for SPGI too.S&amp;P Global remains well poised to gain from growing demand for business information services. Buyouts help innovate, increase differentiated content and develop new products. Effective management execution has helped it generate solid cash flow which is utilized for growth initiatives. Dividend payments and share buybacks boost investors confidence and positively impact earnings per share. Partly due to these positives, the stock has gained in the past year. However, S&amp;P Global remains vulnerable to proceedings, investigations and inquiries with respect to the ratings provided, leading to legal charges, damages or fines. Growth initiatives, higher compensations and incentives raise the company's expenses. Decreasing current ratio is not desirable as it indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 8.15%, and there have been 9 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

53,c64af62b-fd13-319a-9105-b692b205dc5e,TSN,2023-06-20,Bear of the Day: Tyson Foods (TSN),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-day-tyson-foods-tsn-102000242.html,1687256400,STORY,['TSN'],"[In early April, the Zacks Rank pegged Tyson Foods (TSN) as a candidate for lower share prices as earnings estimates fell ahead of their quarterly report on May 8.My colleague Andrew Rocco wrote about TSN slipping into the cellar of the Zacks Rank on April 10 when shares were trading above $60 and he identified several fundamental trends that led analysts to lower their estimates for the chicken products giant.One area of weaker growth surprised me: beef. I didn't know that this segment was bigger for Tyson than its chicken sales. Here's how Andrew summed it up in April...""Meanwhile, last quarter, earnings growth was an abysmal -70% year-over-year. The company's lagging beef segment is one factor dragging down Tyson’s growth. In Q1, Tyson’s beef segment declined from $5,002 million to $4,723 million. The slowdown is not isolated to Tyson – the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) projects fiscal 2023 domestic production to fall roughly 5% in the segment.""Earnings Confirm the SlowdownOn May 8 Tyson Foods came out with a quarterly loss of $0.04 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.81. This compares to earnings of $2.29 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -104.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this meat producer would post earnings of $1.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of -37.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Tyson, which belongs to the Zacks Food - Meat Products industry, posted revenues of $13.13 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.45%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $13.12 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.Zacks Rank Nails the DropWhen Andrew wrote his report in April, analysts had lowered consensus EPS from $4.18 to $2.21, and this dramatic drop in estimates put TSN into the Zacks #5 Rank cellar.Since the May report (for Tyson's Q2 of fiscal year 2023, ending in September), the consensus has now fallen to $1.48 after that big earnings miss and lowered guidance. This keeps TSN shares at a #5 Rank Strong Sell.The stock is also still over 20% lower from April levels. Another interesting dynamic is that the stock is well off of its early 2022 peak near $100 since the bear market began.The reason I find this interesting is that while inflation drove food prices higher for consumers, the producers clearly were hit with higher costs that they couldn't pass along to distributors.This was something that Andrew also identified in his discussion of declining profit margins for Tyson.Quarter BreakdownTyson management also lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2023. This can be accountable to consumers opting for alternatives amid the inflationary landscape, per media sources.Despite a tough protein market, Tyson Foods has been optimistic about its long-term prospects due to its growth strategies and focus on enhancing margins.Total Q2 sales were $13,133 million, nearly flat with the year-ago quarter figure. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,602 million. Average price changes had a 3.2% adverse impact on the top line, while total volumes rose 3.3%.The gross profit in the quarter came in at $527 million, down from the $1,735 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The gross profit, as a percentage of sales, came in at roughly 4%, down from the 13.2% reported in the year-ago quarter.Tyson Foods’ adjusted operating income plunged 94% to $65 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted to 0.5% from the 8.9% reported in the year-ago quarter.Segmental DetailsBeef: Sales in the segment declined to $4,617 million from the $5,034 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Volumes dropped 2.9% and the average price fell 5.4% in the segment.Pork: Sales in the segment declined to $1,421 million from the $1,565 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Volumes climbed 1.1%, while the average price tumbled 10.3%.Chicken: Sales in the segment increased to $4,430 million from the $4,086 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Sales volumes rose 6.4% and the average price increased 2%.Prepared Foods: Sales in the segment rose to $2,422 million from the $2,393 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Prepared Foods’ sales volumes dipped 0.4% and the average price increased 1.6%.International/Other: Sales in the segment were $634 million, up from the $565 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Volumes moved up 8% and the average sales price jumped 4.2%.Bottom line on Tyson: While US chicken consumption is expected to rise to over 100 lbs per capita in this decade, producers face headwinds from rising costs, meat alternatives, and other healthy and/or sustainable choices.

This early engineering solution provides Lockheed Martin and Red 6 additional experience in integrating simulations which could eventually comprise embedded training for the T-50 program and ground-based training systems.""ATARS addresses the critical training inefficiencies in today's training platforms. There has never been a training environment in which you can combine virtual assets being visually represented in the real outdoor world, and the opportunity to overlay this training into ground-based training, until now,"" says Daniel Robinson, founder and CEO at Red 6.ATARS is a multi-node, all-domain augmented reality (AR) system that delivers a complete outdoor synthetic training environment for multiple users. Red 6 technology allows pilots to experience the cognitive loads of physically flying airplanes while capturing the value of synthetics by enabling them to enter realistic, scalable in range and ratio, secure, simulated training environments while airborne in the most dynamic of outdoor environments.""Our vision is to help our customers leverage emerging technologies to seamlessly and securely connect all assets for joint missions, and enable fast and decisive action,"" said Aimee Burnett, vice president, Business Development for the Integrated Fighter Group at Lockheed Martin. ""Lockheed Martin has made significant advances in digital engineering and built strategic partnerships that are enabling us to accelerate development across our platforms.Story continues""One such example is continued integration with Red 6 as we look to build advanced 21st Century Security capabilities that support our customers' needs,"" Burnett continued.Burnett added the T-50 program remains in demand around the world. Lockheed Martin recently submitted the TF-50A variant for the U.S. Air Force's trainer program to serve three near-term missions including tactical training, adversary air support and tactical fighter surrogate. The TF-50A is configured as a light attack fighter/trainer with additional enhancements to include radar, electronic warfare system, tactical data link and other capabilities to meet Air Combat Command requirements.Lockheed Martin also submitted the TF-50N variant for the U.S. Navy's trainer program. The TF-50N is uniquely configured to meet multiple U.S. Navy missions including pilot landing qualification, adversary air, training/chase and tactical surrogate.While the ATARS system is initially targeted for the T-50 program, it could eventually be applied to operational Lockheed Martin platforms such as the F-16, F-22 and F-35.Red 6 is a Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio company.About Lockheed MartinHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 116,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.Please follow @LMNews on Twitter for the latest announcements and news across the corporation.About Red 6  Red 6, founded in 2018, is the creator of Advanced Tactical Augmented Reality System (ATARS), and Augmented Reality Command and Analytic Data Environment (ARCADE).

As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber What's The Opportunity In Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber?According to my valuation model, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber seems to be fairly priced at around 19.65% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $11.34, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.

60,8528a7f8-253e-3fe0-a253-b1b6a7f62941,MRK,2023-06-20,Merck Provides Update on Phase 3 KEYNOTE-585 Trial in Locally Advanced Resectable Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-provides-phase-3-keynote-104500426.html,1687257900,STORY,['MRK'],"[RAHWAY, N.J., June 20, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced topline results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-585 trial, investigating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, followed by adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, then KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients with locally advanced resectable gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. At a pre-specified interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, the study met one of its primary endpoints of pathological complete response (pCR) rate and demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pCR rates compared with chemotherapy alone. For the primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS), there was an improvement in the KEYTRUDA arm; however, results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical analysis plan. The endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not formally tested since superiority was not reached for EFS. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.""While a statistically significant improvement in pathological complete response was observed in this study, we are disappointed that the KEYTRUDA regimen did not significantly improve event-free survival, a result that underscores the challenges in treating locally advanced resectable gastric cancer,"" said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""Innovative research in earlier stages of cancer is critical to help patients achieve better outcomes, and our efforts continue in earnest. We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in this study.""Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA in gastrointestinal cancers and is continuing to study KEYTRUDA for multiple uses in gastric, hepatobiliary, esophageal, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.Story continuesAbout KEYNOTE-585KEYNOTE-585 is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03221426) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin plus capecitabine or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil) as neoadjuvant treatment, followed by adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, then KEYTRUDA monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced resectable gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma. The primary endpoints included EFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of either radiographic disease progression, a local/distant recurrence, clinical progression or death from any cause; pCR rate, defined as a lack of all signs of cancer in tissue samples; and OS, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included disease-free survival and safety. The trial enrolled 1,007 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive three cycles of KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks) in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, followed by adjuvant treatment with three cycles of KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks) plus chemotherapy, then KEYTRUDA monotherapy (200 mg every three weeks for up to 11 cycles) or neoadjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy, then placebo alone.About gastric cancerGastric cancer – also called stomach cancer – is a type of cancer that begins in the stomach and tends to develop slowly over many years. Approximately 90-95% of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, which develop from cells in the innermost lining of the stomach (known as the mucosa). Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 1.1 million patients diagnosed and 768,000 patient deaths from the disease globally in 2020. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 26,500 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 11,000 patient deaths from the disease in 2023.About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical programFinding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Gastric CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

But it was surpassed on day one of the Paris show by Indian rival IndiGo's order for 500 Airbus narrowbody jets.Finalising the deal puts it in the aerospace industry's order backlogs as firm orders. Until now, it was only a preliminary deal. Air India said it was worth $70 billion at list prices, though airlines typically get discounts on big orders worth at least half the headline price, analysts say.Efforts by Indian airlines to keep pace with the world's fastest-growing aviation market, serving the largest population, have sent industry records tumbling even though manufacturers are struggling to meet output goals due to supply chain snags.But some analysts have expressed concern that airlines could be over-ordering jets in pursuit of the same passengers.Air India's deal includes 250 planes from Airbus and 220 from Boeing. The Airbus part comprises 210 A320neo and A321neo narrowbody jets and 40 A350 widebodies. Boeing's deal is for 190 narrowbody 737 MAXs, plus 20 787 Dreamliner and 10 777X widebodies.""Our ambitious fleet renewal and expansion programme will see Air India operate the most advanced and fuel-efficient aircraft across our route network within five years,"" Air India Chief Executive Campbell Wilson said in a statement.The buying spree by Indian airlines adds to signs of strong global demand for civilian aircraft as travel rebounds from the pandemic and airlines look to reduce their environmental impact with more fuel-efficient new models.Demand has been hottest for short and medium-haul narrowbody jets, but engine maker Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday the market for long-haul widebodies was also coming back strongly.Story continuesHowever, planemakers and their suppliers remain concerned about their ability to meet bulging order books amid rising costs, parts shortages and a scarcity of skilled workers.Lars Wagner, CEO of MTU Aero Engines, said on Tuesday labour shortages and problems with the production of castings were the biggest strains in the engine supply chain.INDIAN RIVALRYAir India, with its maharajah mascot, was once known for its lavishly decorated planes and stellar service, but its reputation declined in the mid-2000s as financial troubles mounted.Its renaissance under the Tata conglomerate aims to capitalise on India's growing base of fliers and large diaspora, currently mostly served by foreign rivals such as Emirates.The mega-order will also put Air India on a stronger footing to compete with budget rival IndiGo, which has a majority share of the Indian market and a strong position in regional flights.Elsewhere at the show on Tuesday, Ethiopian Airlines said it expected to announce an order for about 130 Airbus and Boeing planes shortly after the event.Leasing company Avolon finalised an order for 40 Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes, while Philippine Airlines firmed up an order for nine Airbus A350-1000 widebody jets and Qantas finalised a deal for nine Airbus A220-300s, confirming a Reuters report.(Reporting by Tim Hepher, Joanna Plucinska, Allison Lampert, Valerie Insinna and Aditi Shah; Editing by Mark Potter)]"

Released today at the Paris Air Show, Ansys' Sustainable Aviation Survey also explores consumers' concerns with aviation-related air pollution as well as their expectations for next-generation air travel.Ansys’ Sustainable Aviation Survey showcases consumer attitudes toward aviation’s carbon footprint, the future of flight, and safetyAs global aviation leaders and organizations aim to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, aircraft manufacturers are embracing Ansys' leading-edge digital transformation technologies to develop more efficient aircraft, engines, and propulsion systems.Of consumers polled in Ansys' survey, nearly 70% said they would be more likely to trust alternative fuel sources — sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), electric, hybrid-electric, or hydrogen-powered — if the technology was extensively simulated and tested using established methods applied to aircraft safety. Additional highlights of the survey include:SustainabilityA majority of consumers are concerned about CO2 emissions (63%) and would pay for greener air travel (65%)46% would travel in an aircraft powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the next 5 years, 36% in electric, 38% in hybrid-electric, and 38% in hydrogen-powered aircraft.About a third of consumers (32%) are more likely to fly with airlines committed to reducing their carbon footprint.The Future of Flight Most respondents (82%) would be comfortable flying in next-gen aircraft at speeds of 3,500 mph versus standard aircraft that flies at 560 mph to get to their destinations faster. Shortened flight times provide a significant benefit for consumers, as 50% of respondents reported that they have not traveled somewhere in the past due to a long flight.More than half of consumers (57%) expect to fly in an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft at some point in their lives, citing potential benefits for daily commuting, including a reduction in stress (27%), road rage (26%), and carbon footprints (35%).Almost half (47%) of consumers polled are prepared to fly in an autonomous plane in their lifetimes.Story continuesSafetyDespite anticipation to take an autonomous flight, the top concern for 57% of consumers is the absence of a pilot to respond to potential external or internal issues such as turbulence and flight control, respectively.For alternative aircraft such as SAF-powered planes, half of customers worry that technology isn't proven yet and almost 40% fear a technology failure.""Consumer research is essential as the aviation industry transforms to meet the demands of consumers and needs of our planet,"" said Walt Hearn, senior vice president of worldwide sales and customer excellence at Ansys. ""Ansys' simulation solutions not only help engineers build cleaner and smarter systems, but also help manufacturers establish trust with consumers. By virtually testing and verifying new technologies with simulation, aircraft manufacturers can demonstrate the viability of sustainable alternatives, build confidence where there is uncertainty, and expand the possibilities for next-generation air travel safely and efficiently.""Visit Ansys at the 2023 Paris Air Show in France from June 19-25 to learn more about simulation's impact in the aviation industry.Survey Methodology1 An online survey was conducted by Atomik Research among 6,029 respondents from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.

Taking this into account, STYAX has a positive alpha of 0.84, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.RatingsInvestors should also consider a bond's rating, which is a grade ( 'AAA' to 'D' ) given to a bond that indicates its credit quality. With this letter scale in mind, STYAX has 57.99% in high quality bonds rated at least 'AA' or higher, while 29.11% are of medium quality, with ratings of 'A' to 'BBB'. The fund has an average quality of AA, and focuses on high quality securities.Story continuesExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, STYAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.85% compared to the category average of 0.77%. So, STYAX is actually more expensive than its peers from a cost perspective.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $1,000, and each subsequent investment should be at least $100.Bottom LineOverall, Wells Fargo Core Plus Bond A ( STYAX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, better downside risk, and higher fees, Wells Fargo Core Plus Bond A ( STYAX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.For additional information on the Mutual Fund Bond area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

These enterprises might not immediately reward you with life-changing returns. However, if you stay with them long enough, they might pleasantly surprise you.Fundamentally, investors have much to look forward to, from financial technology (fintech) platforms to artificial intelligence to quantum computing. At the same time, not every company that drops its name in the hat will succeed. Therefore, market participants must choose their top long-term tech stocks carefully.Nevertheless, you also don’t want to miss out on possibly paradigm-shifting opportunities merely because of the fear of failure. On that note, below are compelling tech stocks for long-term investment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVWhile tech juggernaut IBM (NYSE:IBM) doesn’t always get love due to its arguably misplaced staid reputation, as one of the tech stocks with long-term potential, you’re not going to find too many superior wagers. True, “Big Blue” may have spent a bit too much time with its legacy business units, but it has since branched into multiple relevant arenas.Perhaps most noticeably, IBM stands among the top long-term tech stocks thanks to its pioneering work in AI. Initiatives such as IBM Watson not only confirm the power of advanced digitalization in the laboratory but also features a lengthy list of real-world applications. From healthcare to finance to legal to even fantasy football, Watson delivered distinctive utilitarianism.Also, IBM has an edge over other tech stocks for long-term investment because of its generous forward yield of 4.87%. Significantly, this rate of passive income soars above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. While the payout ratio is a bit on the high side at 66.53%, IBM delivers 30 years of consecutive dividend increases.Story continuesASML (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockAlthough ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) might not be a household name yet, it likely will be in the future. As semiconductors become more advanced and deliver far more computing capacity per unit of space, they require unique processes. ASML rose to fame because of its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography capabilities. Per CNBC, it’s the only company in the world manufacturing lithography machines. That alone makes ASML one of the tech stocks with long-term potential.Indeed, you can make the argument that the tech sector might grind to a halt without ASML in business. According to CNBC, “EUV lithography is the most expensive step in making the advanced microchips that power data centers, cars, and iPhones.” Therefore, ASML enjoys a monopoly on the fabrication of EUV lithography equipment.Moving forward, tech experts will develop various protocols and platforms utilizing AI, machine learning, and other innovations. However, the common thread will likely be EUV lithography. Therefore, ASML is one of the best long-term tech stocks to buy.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for tech stocks with long-term potential, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers a no-brainer bullish idea. To be blunt, it’s almost cheating to bring up MSFT. Thanks to the underlying company’s enormously deep and wide relevancies, it’s a shoo-in for almost any tech-related investment discussion. Unsurprisingly, even with the Nasdaq Composite index shooting up nearly 30% year-to-date, MSFT outflanks it at 38.5% up.Right now, MSFT represents one of the long-game tech stocks thanks to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI, the creator of the popular chatbot ChatGPT. Having used ChatGPT myself, it can be quite a powerful tool depending on the context of the information you’re seeking.Referencing more objective data, Grand View Research points out that the global chatbot market size reached a valuation of $5.13 billion last year. Experts there project that the underlying segment will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.3% from 2023 to 2030. At the culmination of the forecast period, the segment should ring up revenue of $27.3 billion.As I said, MSFT makes a great case for top long-term tech stocks.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThe tech juggernaut that modern society can’t live without, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) sparked controversies over the years because of its outsized influence. However, those controversies in a roundabout way undergird the reason why GOOG ranks among the tech stocks with long-term potential. Thanks to Alphabet’s massive Google ecosystem, it’s difficult to function outside of it.Put bluntly, Google owns the world (well, maybe not Japan, which prefers Yahoo for some reason). And therefore, we’re guests in its home, whether we like it or not (and many of us don’t). Looking at this narrative agnostically, though, GOOGL makes an excellent case for tech stocks for long-term investment. This magnitude of power and influence will be difficult to usurp.To be fair, Microsoft’s ChatGPT partnership on paper presents significant competition to the Google ecosystem. However, in the long run, I think Alphabet will be fine. For one thing, the company’s working on its own chatbot called Bard. Also, Google offers an arguably unprecedented platform for human-driven research, something that might not go away entirely given AI’s mistakes.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comA major winner during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, the collective quarantining benefitted digital payment processor and financial technology (fintech) specialist PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Sadly, the wheels started to come off in late 2021, leading to devastation throughout most of 2022. Competitive concerns along with consumer economy woes put the hurt on PYPL stock.Nevertheless, PYPL may still rank among the tech stocks with long-term potential. A possible saving grace for the long haul could originate from the burgeoning gig economy. Statista points out that the projected gross volume of the gig economy could hit $455.2 billion by the end of 2023. By 2028, this arena of freelancers (i.e. independent contractors) globally could hit $918.94 billion.Fundamentally, corporate employers may start recalling their workers, which means the gig economy could see increased expansion. Therefore, PayPal is ideally positioned in large part to its intuitive platform and brand power. This makes PYPL an excellent speculative candidate for tech stocks for long-term investment.IonQ (IONQ)A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ StockSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.comProviding something for everyone, the final two ideas for tech stocks with long-term potential are incredibly risky, beginning with IonQ (NYSE:IONQ). Based in College Park, Maryland, IonQ is a quantum computing hardware and software company. Per its public profile, the entity seeks to develop a general-purpose trapped ion quantum computer and software to generate, optimize, and execute quantum circuits.According to McKinsey &amp; Company, “[q]uantum computing is a new approach to calculation that uses principles of fundamental physics to solve extremely complex problems very quickly.” Leveraging an entirely fresh paradigm, quantum computers can operate exponentially faster than the most advanced “classical” computers.Given the possibility of utterly disrupting the innovation ecosystem, IONQ represents a speculative favorite among the best long-term tech stocks. Since the beginning of this year, shares have already skyrocketed to nearly 205%. Enticingly, though, the recent consolidation pattern may be setting up a bullish flag formation, suggesting even more gains ahead.FormFactor (FORM)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockBased in Livermore, California, FormFactor (NASDAQ:FORM) is a leading provider of essential test and measurement technologies along the full integrated circuit life cycle. This specialty encompasses characterization, modeling, and reliability tests. As well, it includes de-bugging, qualification, and production tests, making it an integral component of tech stocks with long-term potential.For the latest innovations in computing technologies, FormFactor offers a range of cryogenic test and measurement solutions to quantum engineers. Thanks to its underlying applicability, FORM stock gained nearly 42% of its equity value since the start of the year. However, it’s a lesser-known entity among quantum-based long-game tech stocks, losing about 14% of value in the trailing year.At the same time, the red ink may present a discounted opportunity. After all, Precedence Research projects that by 2030, the global quantum computing sector value might hit $125 billion. Featuring a market capitalization of $2.4 billion, FormFactor enjoys a burgeoning total addressable market.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.3%, 2.6% and 3.3%, respectively. For the tech-heavy Nasdaq, this marked the eighth consecutive winning week.Stocks did well throughout the week on the back of encouraging inflation numbers and the Fed’s much anticipated rate-hike pause. However, during the latter part of the week, the market pared some of the gains it had made earlier as cautionary comments made by Fed officials started to sink in. The rate-hike cycle might have come to an end as of now, but it is still likely to be resumed at the next Fed FOMC meeting.In fact, there is a majoritarian view that the central bank would indeed re-embark on its path of policy-tightening from its next meeting. A few officials have suggested that there would be at least another half a percentage point hike before the year ends. They have also warned that although headline inflation is definitively coming down, core inflation is not.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.Here are some of our key achievements:Rockwell Medical and VirTra Surge Following Zacks Rank UpgradeShares of Rockwell Medical, Inc. RMTI have soared 129.4% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 8.5% increase) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on April 5.Another stock, VirTra, Inc.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Story continuesThis stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;A hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks returned +2.7% this year (through May 15th) vs. +7.69% for the S&amp;P 500 index.Check Rockwell Medical’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Check VirTra’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Recommendation Upgrade Drives Lisata and Unum HigherShares of Lisata Therapeutics, Inc.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. United Airlines (UAL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.04 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 19, 2023.United Airlines' Earnings ESP sits at 7.3%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.04 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.77.UAL is part of a big group of Transportation stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at American Airlines (AAL) as well.American Airlines, which is readying to report earnings on July 20, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.54 a share, and AAL is 31 days out from its next earnings report.American Airlines' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 6.14% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46.Story continuesUAL and AAL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

93,dcfb4028-0895-3989-adfb-f3520dded434,BXP,2023-06-20,3 Office REITs to Sell Before the Commercial Property Crash,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-office-reits-sell-commercial-105501872.html,1686740101,STORY,"['VNO', 'BAM', 'HPP', 'BXP']","[In early June, I read an article about Shark Tank star Barbara Corcoran’s thoughts about the current state of affairs for office space.“No one really believes it’s going to turn the corner,” Fortune reported Corcoran’s comments. “People are staying home. Our best office buildings in midtown Manhattan are 50% occupied, and in most major cities or in secondary cities, we have a 20% vacancy rate. No one wants to take that chance.”Corcoran believes it’s going to get worse before it gets better. A big part of why it will worsen is with defaults rising on real estate loans. That makes all but the best office-focused real estate investment trusts (REITs) off-limits. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEven excellent companies such as, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM), need help with some of their office holdings. In Brookfield’s case, its Los Angeles office portfolio is starting to implode slightly. However, investing in BAM gives you a diversified portfolio of alternative assets. With pure-play office REITs, you don’t. For this reason, I’d look at these three office REITs to sell.Hudson Pacific Properties (HPP)Stocks to sellSource: chanpipat / Shutterstock.comHudson Pacific Properties (NYSE:HPP) recently cut its dividend by 50% to 12.5 cents a share. The Los Angeles-based company isn’t a pure-play office REIT. It also owns 90 sound stages in six global media markets. It recently acquired Quixote Studios for $360 million. Quixote owns 23 sound stages and a fleet of film production trucks and cast trailers. It’s hard to know if that’s a good or bad thing. After all, Hollywood is in the middle of a protracted writer’s strike. That can’t be good for sound stage rentals. So, while the long-term prognosis for film production is good, Hudson Pacific currently has two hot potatoes. The REIT’s office portfolio is primarily in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Seattle. As Wolf Street mentioned on June 9, the office vacancy rates in those four markets are between 23% and 33%. Story continuesThe company had nothing but red ink since 2020. In the trailing 12 months ended March 31, HPP lost $57 million on $1.03 billion in revenue. Their stock is down 70% over the past year and 86% over the past five years. This is a falling knife you don’t want to catch. Stay away. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockIt’s been quite a few years since Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) was involved with Toys ‘R’ Us. VNO bought the toy retailer as part of an investment group in 2005, and by 2018, it was liquidated while in bankruptcy proceedings. Vornado is the fourth largest office REIT by market cap. The company suspended its dividend for 2023. However, assuming business gets better, Vornado will restart their dividend in 2024. That’s a big if, according to Corcoran. The second-largest office landlord in New York City, it’s selling off some properties in the Big Apple to generate cash. However, as Wolf Street points out, New York Office towers are selling for much lower valuations than they did back in 2016. No dividend, no seller’s market, and a New York office market in the toilet suggests you might want to wait until the work-from-home trend completely dies down. So far, it’s not looking good.  Further, even Mad Money host Jim Cramer doesn’t recommend Vornado.“The management there is so strong, but the tug of war against New York is so bad I’m not going to recommend Vornado,” Cramer commented on May 25.  Boston Properties (BXP)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockIn January, I included Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) in a group of seven REITs that will be big winners in 2023. Boy, I was definitely wrong about that. But, seriously, BXP is down more than 18% year-to-date, 40% over the past year, and 55% over the past five. Swing and a miss. Not even close. I reasoned that BXP shares were cheaper from a valuation perspective then at any time in the past decade. You can’t blame a guy for looking for a good deal every now and again. However, what I also said explains why its share price is stuck in neutral.“Wisely, it concentrates its properties in six markets: Boston (34.7% of total premier space in the central business district), Washington D.C. (19.9%), San Francisco (39%), Seattle (25.1%), and Manhattan (9.6%),” I wrote on Jan. 25. Unfortunately, office buildings aren’t getting enough leases signed, whether Class A or Class C. That’s not good news if you’re a shareholder. As Corcoran said, it’s likely to get worse before it gets better for the likes of Vornado.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.43 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 19, 2023.LVS has an Earnings ESP figure of 5.62%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.43 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.41.LVS is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Royal Caribbean (RCL).Royal Caribbean is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 27, 2023. RCL's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.56 a share 38 days from its next earnings release.Royal Caribbean's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 3.86% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50.Story continuesLVS and RCL's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

GIII appears promising, thanks to its robust business strategies, including digital expansion and brand strength. Management remains optimistic about the company’s diversified portfolio backed by five global power brands, namely DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld Paris. GIII undertakes several strategies, including acquisitions and licensing of well-known brands, to expand its product portfolio.Such endeavors have helped the company’s shares to increase 45.5%, outperforming the industry’s 8.4% rise.  Analysts seem optimistic about the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $3.3 billion and $3.03, respectively. These estimates show corresponding increases of 1.5% and 8.7% year over year. A VGM Score of A with an expected earnings growth rate of 15% bode well for this current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.Delving DeeperWe note that G-III Apparel has numerous growth opportunities including the Spring 2024 repositioning, expansion of the Donna Karan label and a new long-term license for the Nautica brand. Nautica is available in nearly 1300 freestanding stores and shops globally and boasts a sturdy digital presence in over 30 countries.The company is on track to produce Nautica products across several categories starting with jeanswear. This includes jeans and a complete range of corresponding lifestyle products. The company will later expand in a phased manner with other categories like sportswear, suit separates and dresses.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement is on track with the development of the Nautica and Donna Karan brands. For Nautica, the company is working on bringing the Spring 2024 jeans line to life while for Donna Karan, it is leveraging the brand’s classic, contemporary and elevated feel and widening its appeal to a broader consumer base. Furthermore, the company has been maximizing its omnichannel opportunities and leveraging data for a while.G-III Apparel has announced a new licensing agreement for the Halston brand. The company has entered into a 25-year agreement with Xcel Brands to design and manufacture all categories with the choice to buy the brand at the end of the licensing term. Halston is an American heritage brand with a legacy of glamorous designs across a range of price points. The first deliveries are likely to be in 2024 fall.Overall, the company’s strategic priorities include driving power brands across categories, enhancing its portfolio via ownership of brands and licensing opportunities, expanding global reach, maximizing omnichannel capabilities and scaling the private label business.Story continuesG-III Apparel has also been making progress on rightsizing the inventory. As port congestion and lead times have normalized, management has adjusted the warehouse space appropriately. This trend is likely to continue throughout the year, driven by moderate freight costs.Buoyed by the strengths, G-III Apparel posted better-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2024, wherein the top and the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s brands, DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger outperformed management’s expectations, led by categories, such as dresses, sportswear and suit separates. Its North American DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris businesses performed well.For fiscal 2024, management projects net sales of about $3.29 billion, up from $3.23 billion recorded in fiscal 2023. Management anticipates gross-margin improvement in fiscal 2024, up nearly 350 basis points year over year, driven by highly moderated freight costs. Adjusted EPS is likely to come in the band of $2.80-$2.90 for the current fiscal year versus $2.85 earned in fiscal 2023. Management expects solid cash flows this year as the inventory levels normalize.Given all the aforesaid tailwinds, we believe, G-III Apparel will continue to perform well on the bourses.Eye These Solid Picks TooSome other top-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, Crocs CROX and lululemon athletica LULU.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank of 1 at present.

(NYSE:V) is a global payment technology company that operates one of the world's largest electronic payment networks. It provides financial institutions, merchants and consumers with a range of products and services for electronic payments.Visas shares have gained 20.47% over the past year and are up 10.18 % year to date. Yet, I don't think it's anywhere near overpriced territory. There are many things to like about Visa nowadays. The company is close to another important acquisition, it has great growth prospects due to its bet on the future of Africas fintech industry and its valuation is attractive.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with FSS. Click here to check it out. V 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VPeter Lynch Chart of VVisa continues international expansion effortsAccording to Bloomberg, Visa is in ""advanced talks"" and could be close to announcing a deal by the end of June to acquire Pismo, a Brazilian payments company that helps banks and financial technology companies launch cards and payment products rapidly.This shows Visa's continued focus on seeking growth in foreign markets with a lot of business potential. In a similar vein, Visa recently announced the launch of the new Visa Africa Fintech Accelerator program to ""help enable Africas expanding start-up community through expertise, connections, technology, and investment funding. According to Visa, ""Africa has one of the most exciting and admired fintech ecosystems in the world, bringing outstanding entrepreneurial talent to a young digital-first population that is growing fast.""These international expansion efforts support further innovation and growth potential for Visa, building off a very strong business model that delivers consistent revenue and robust profitability.Visa has a strong economic moat and a leading position in the credit services industryVisa's economic moat mainly consists of network effect, brand recognition, infrastructure and technological expertise. Its primary strength lies in its extensive payment network, which connects financial institutions, merchants and consumers worldwide. The more participants that join the network, the more valuable it becomes, creating a strong network effect. This network effect makes it difficult for competitors to challenge Visa's dominance because participants benefit from being part of the widely accepted and efficient Visa payment network. Visa is one of the most recognized and trusted payment brands globally. This brand recognition creates a significant barrier for potential competitors trying to establish themselves in the payment industry.Story continuesThe payment industry is heavily regulated in many countries, which can create barriers to entry for new players. Visa has a well-established presence and compliance framework that allows it to navigate these regulations effectively. Compliance with regulatory requirements and licenses can be complex and costly, serving as a deterrent for new entrants. Visa's scale and infrastructure play a crucial role in its economic moat. The company's infrastructure, including data centers, processing capabilities and security systems, has been built over many years and requires substantial investment to replicate.Visa has been at the forefront of technological advancements in the payment industry. It continuously invests in research and development to enhance its payment solutions, improve security measures and adapt to evolving consumer preferences. Visa's technological expertise and innovation capabilities enable it to stay ahead of the curve and maintain its competitive edge in the market.In addition to Visa's individual strengths, it also benefits from the base business model of payments processing, which has built-in inflation protection and grows alongside economies.ValuationVisas shares closed at $228.91 on Friday, June 16, with a price-earnings ratio of 30.60, a price-book ratio of 12.44 and a price-sales ratio of 15.58. At first, these figures may not seem impressive from a valuation perspective, but on the other hand, the GF Value chart finds the stock is modestly undervalued based on a combination of historical valuations, past capital gains and analysts' estimates.Visa: Transforming Africa's Fintech EcosystemAt 98 out of 100, the GF Score indicates the company has high outperformance potential based on a historical study by GuruFocus.Visa: Transforming Africa's Fintech EcosystemThe company has a remarkable return on equity of 45.11% as of March 2023, which shows profitability is exceptional.For a large and mature company with a market cap of about $480 billion, it is very positive to see that it has a five-star GuruFocus business predictability rank, which indicates an average return of at least 12.1% annually over 10 years. The three-year revenue growth has been 10.7%, and analysts from Morningstar estimate a three-year forward revenue growth of 11.27%.Visa's well-established position, brand recognition, growth efforts and network effect give it a significant advantage over competitors and make it a compelling value opportunity in my opinion. The valuation is cheap compared to the future outlook, with growth prospects expanding in foreign markets.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

100,c2899848-d052-3490-b8db-9fde9a0e9f41,NWSA,2023-06-20,Wall Street Analysts Believe News Corp. (NWSA) Could Rally 30.45%: Here's is How to Trade,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-believe-news-135506699.html,1687182906,STORY,"['TGT', 'NWSA']","[Shares of News Corp. (NWSA) have gained 5.3% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $19.57, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $25.53 indicates a potential upside of 30.5%.The mean estimate comprises four short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $3.66. While the lowest estimate of $21.10 indicates a 7.8% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 53.3% to reach $30. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.But, for NWSA, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in NWSAAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, two estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 11.5%.Moreover, NWSA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NWSA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

102,39a3711b-286c-3b0a-8b35-a75124f9c8ed,VZ,2023-06-20,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-verizon-communications-130012200.html,1687179612,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has lost 3.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share, indicating a change of -10.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -9.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.69 indicates a change of +0.2% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $33.53 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.8%. The $135.08 billion and $136.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.3% and +1.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $32.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.36%. The EPS surprise was +0.84%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fisher believes that luxury goods companies have a unique ability to thrive even during challenging economic times. These companies, known for their premium brands and top-notch craftsmanship, tend to attract a dedicated customer base that values exclusivity and quality.“Times are good for global luxury goods,” Fisher said. “Heated inflation didn’t dent their robust gross profit margins, which have remained above 55 per cent since 2021.”There are other positive developments happening too. Despite concerns of a stalling economic recovery, big French and Swiss companies have been racking up robust sales in China, and as wealth in India spreads wider, big global names are now penetrating there too, causing a “luxury goods spending boom.”“Look around you in the Middle East and North Africa,” he goes on to add. “The big global brands are expanding everywhere, particularly in the UAE.”With that in mind, then, we opened the TipRanks database and got the lowdown on two luxury goods names well-liked by certain Wall Street analysts, who see both having plenty of room to run in the coming months.

(TPR)The first name we’ll look at is Tapestry, a renowned luxury brand that has cemented its place as a global leader in the fashion and accessories industry. Tapestry operates three distinct labels: Coach, Kate Spade New York, and Stuart Weitzman. Each brand brings its own thing to the market, catering to different segments of its luxury consumer base.Story continuesFlagship brand Coach combines classic elements with modern touches, appealing to both men and women seeking out elegant and functional pieces. Kate Spade New York, on the other hand, is known for its playful and vibrant approach, while Stuart Weitzman is recognized for its high-quality footwear.Despite a slowdown of luxury purchases in the US, boosted by sales in China rising by 20%, the company delivered a strong top-line in its latest quarterly report, for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 (March quarter). In total, revenue climbed by 5% year-over-year to $1.51 billion, whilst beating the Street’s forecast by $70 million. Likewise on the profitability profile, EPS of $0.78 trumped the analysts’ $0.60 forecast.The company also increased its outlook for the fiscal year. The company now expects revenue growth of 3% compared to 2% to 3% beforehand and anticipates delivering a profit of $3.85 to $3.90 a share, vs. the prior $3.75. Additionally, Tapestry remains on course to repurchase around $700 million in common stock in the current fiscal year.All of the above posits Tapestry as his “Industry Baby,” says Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul.“We believe high profitability, experienced management, strong balance sheet, and healthy brand equity of the Coach brand deserves a seat at the luxury and accessible luxury table,” the analyst explained. “We expect this management team to continue to execute against its FY25 $5.00+ EPS target and believe there is significant potential share price upside from current levels. We remain confident in management’s ability to execute its strategy, which we would expect to drive significant multiple expansion. While we are mindful of recessionary concerns, we believe this management team and portfolio of brands has the ability to weather the downturns.”Putting these thoughts into gradings and numbers, Drbul rates Tapestry shares a Buy, backed by a $60 price target. This suggests the shares will climb 38% higher over the coming months. (To watch Drbul’s track record, click here)Most analysts agree with Drbul’s take. The stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 10 Buys vs. 3 Holds. At $51.27, the average target makes room for one-year gains of ~18%. As an added bonus, Tapestry also pays out a dividend. The current quarterly payout stands at $0.30 and yields 2.65%. (See Tapestry stock forecast)Capri Holdings (CPRI)We’ll stay in the same vicinity for our next luxury brand name. Capri Holdings is a leading global fashion luxury group with three iconic brands operating under its umbrella: Michael Kors, Versace, and Jimmy Choo. This company has also established a strong presence in the luxury fashion industry and is well-known for its craftsmanship, glamour and innovation. Each brand in the portfolio has its distinct identity and offers a wide range of products, including apparel, accessories, footwear, and fragrances.That said, revenues fell across the board in the latest quarterly readout, for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 (March quarter). With its brands seeing year-over-year declines, total revenue dropped by 10.1% to $1.34 billion. Still, the drop was expected on the Street and the figure actually managed to beat expectations by $60 million. At the other end of the spectrum, adjusted earnings per share of $0.97 met the prognosticators’ forecast.Moving forward, Capri sees full-year F2024 revenue of ~$5.7 billion, a touch below consensus at $5.73 billion. On the other hand, the estimated EPS of $6.40 is higher than the Street’s $6.28 forecast.Despite the luxury brand segment’s success this year, Capri stock has been excluded from the rally and is down by 36%. Nevertheless, following talks with management, BMO analyst Simeon Siegel thinks the shares’ valuation is way too low, and he believes they offer good value at current levels.“Our recent management meetings addressed topics including guidance puts-and-takes, pricing/GM, brand-strategy, inventory and capital allocation,” Siegel said. “Management expressed confidence in guidance given self-help (staffing/product initiatives etc) and easing compares. CPRI’s one of our best ‘guide-beaters’ but, to be fair, their ‘reiterated’ guides have also seen subsequent cuts. However, we believe it shouldn’t matter as shares are already pricing meaningful cuts/miss. We commend management’s focus on maintaining brand equity, believe shares inexpensive and reiterate our Outperform rating given intrinsic value mismatch.”That Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating comes alongside a $68 price target, which implies shares will post growth of 84% over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Siegel’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, the stock garners an additional 9 Buys and 6 Holds for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $50.69 average target, a year from now, investors will be pocketing returns of 37%.

104,1a7b7792-0da7-37db-a170-5c4890ee154c,SWK,2023-06-20,3 Stocks to Watch From the Buoyant Manufacturing Tools Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-watch-buoyant-manufacturing-131800381.html,1687180680,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'KMT', 'LECO', 'SWK']","[The Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry is poised to gain from improving supply chains, resulting in easier availability of raw materials and faster deliveries. Cost-control measures and investments in product innovation and development augur well for the industry’s growth. These factors point to a rosy outlook for the manufacturing tools industry despite some near-term softness from a slowdown in the manufacturing sector.Companies like Stanley Black &amp; Decker SWK, Lincoln Electric LECO and Kennametal KMT are well positioned to take advantage of the buoyancy in the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry comprises companies that develop and distribute hand and mechanics tools, hydraulic tools, engineered fastening systems, and heavy-lifting technology solutions. Arc-welding products, robotic-welding packages, fume-extraction equipment, oxy-fuel cutting equipment, plasma cutters, healthcare solutions, electronic security solutions and other products are also produced by some tool-makers. The highly advanced tools are used in industrial, commercial, oil &amp; gas, mining, automotive and other industries. The providers of electronic security solutions cater to commercial, retailers, government, financial and healthcare markets. Talking about international operations, some industry players provide products and services to customers in North and South America, Japan, Europe, Canada, Asia and the Middle East.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing Tools IndustryPersistent Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Continued weakness in the manufacturing sector signals a low-demand environment for the industry players. Per the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, in May, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index) touched 46.9%, contracting for the seventh consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index remained in contraction territory at 42.6%, declining 3.1 percentage points from the figure recorded in April. As recession fears loom large amid a slowdown in the U.S. economy, businesses expect continued softness in demand at least in the near term.Easing Supply Chain Disruptions: While supply chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved as evident from the ISM report’s Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the eighth straight month in May. Easing supply chain issues should support manufacturing tools companies’ growth in 2023. Cost-control measures support the margins of the industry participants despite inflationary pressure. Investments in Product Development &amp; Innovation: The industry participants’ constant focus on innovation, product upgrades and development of new products to stay competitive in the market should drive growth. Focus on expanding product offerings, geographical reach and customer base through strategic acquisitions should continue to drive revenues of these companies.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #120.

Because when NVIDIA reported quarterly earnings on May 24, those looking in the rearview mirror ran off the road in bewilderment.Maybe they got scared by the “smart trucks” (large quantitative investors) accelerating behind them.But if they had only listened to me in my umpteenth explanation of why you buy NVDA at all valuations between 10 and 20 times sales, they would have been looking forward.For years I have said two things over and over again…1. Advances in Gaming GPU R&amp;D were teaching NVIDIA engineers what they needed to know to build the foundations of AI.2. Datacenter demands for AI “massively parallel architectures” would overtake Gaming revenues in the early 2020s.  On March 20, I published a special edition of Zacks Confidential (ZC) where I outlined why NVIDIA was still the reigning “King of AI” and how the acceleration of, and access to, tools from ChatGPT had just put the stock back on the launch pad -- even though we already had 100%+ gains from buying the October lows.Here are some excerpts from that report titled ChatGPT: Time to Become an AI Conversationalist…I've pounded the table about the King of AI since 2016 for several reasons that all preceded the current gee-whiz fascination with ChatGPT -- including the emerging ability for software to write itself.What I did NOT predict is that ChatGPT would catch on like wildfire this year and be the instrument that directly and rapidly teaches everyone the power of AI.Now, we're all talking about the ""super bot"" in awed, hushed tones, and wondering what jobs it can replace.In this report, we'll examine the capabilities, and the fears, of the chatterbox that ate the internet.What Was So Super About NVIDIA AI Before ChatGPT?First, we recap a basic 3-prong thesis for being awed by the power of AI, especially in the hands of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and his teams of engineering wizards...1) NVIDIA does deep research in nearly all applications of HPC (high-performance computing) and hyper-scale data mining and modeling that create the foundations for autonomous driving, protein and molecule discovery, factory design and automation, and the future of scientific discoveries in cancer, energy, agriculture, longevity, and climate.And they are able to do this because they don't just build the hardware GPU (graphics processing unit) semiconductors that make hyper-scale possible. They also build the software engines that integrate with them in a full stack of developer tools called CUDA, for Compute Unified Device Architecture. Along with work at Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft, these are the most powerful platforms in the world that can use neural networks to create machine learning (ML) reinforcement and deep learning (DL) inference.For these reasons, I continuously encourage investors -- whether they own NVDA shares or not -- to frequent the company's newsroom page to see the constant stream of innovations, discoveries, and partnerships that make the industry of AI as powerful as any for business, science, and society.2) Jensen Huang and his superior leadership strategy is not only focused on hiring the best engineering talent, but they also collaborate with major scientific institutions and technology companies to put the best tools in the smartest, most(ly) ethical hands. They build the most powerful supercomputers in the world for these organizations by stacking and connecting hundreds of their GPU-based DGX machines, as one example, to create ""massively parallel architectures"" vs. the slower serial-processing of CPUs from Intel.Plus, they know how to evangelize the platform technologies of AI by supporting developer communities where new ideas and solutions will be created at ground level that we haven't even imagined.3) The day that software can meaningfully write itself is nearly upon us. I've written often about Ray Kurzweil's ""singularity"" prediction -- when AGI (artificial general intelligence) becomes equivalent (or superior) to human intelligence -- and he may be getting ready to pull that forecast forward again, from his original target for the year 2045.(end of excerpt from my March 20th Zacks Confidential)In that report, I said that investors still needed to buy the stock at $250 then, looking for at least $300 this year -- despite semiconductor analyst Joe Moore at Morgan Stanley reluctantly raising his price target to $300.Little did he or I know that Jensen &amp; Co. would blow the roof off with a big raise in sales guidance on May 24. But I want to share what he said because, at the time, he was very prescient about the NVDA + GPT growth potential -- even though he was a reluctant diner and I was devouring the feast of possibilities with years of high double-digit compound growth ahead as AI surpasses the mobile industry revolution with a potential TAM (total addressable market) of $15 trillion…Network Effects and Exponential CompoundingLast Friday (3/17/23), a Morgan Stanley analyst threw in the towel on his Neutral rating for NVDA and wrote ""The stock will continue to be hard to ignore in an otherwise challenging semiconductor environment.""Analyst Joseph Moore raised his rating on NVDA shares to Overweight from Equal-Weight and bumped his price target from $255 to $304 as he conceded that he underestimated the growth resilience of the innovator's products and admitted that the ""megatrend"" of generative AI will overshadow all doubts.""The high capital intensity of these workloads, particularly on the training side, is now a major part of the calculus for the largest companies in technology, with NVIDIA having dominance in the training market that is likely to persist for several years even with a relatively fixed number of model developers, model complexity plus multiple languages should still drive 3-5x growth in training over 5 years.""Moore also observed that the enthusiasm the firm is seeing for Large Language Models is boosting spending both in the near and long-term. In fact, NVDA just filed a securities shelf offering for $10 billion two weeks ago and, since the stock barely flinched, maybe that's what moved the analyst to admit how dominant their position will remain with new investment. Large enterprise customers who depend on data ""mining and modeling"" will want what Jensen is building for many years to come.As his final mea culpa, Moore noted that ""the power of transformers has become clear as products such as ChatGPT and other AI workloads have moved up priority lists and are now seen as one of the most significant developments in technology since the development of mobile internet.""How Forward Estimate Revisions Leave Behind the Backward BearsIn my full ZC on ChatGPT, which you can get a copy of by emailing Ultimate@Zacks.com -- and tell ‘em Cooker sent you -- I explain the dynamics of “GPT” (Generative Pre-Training Transformers) and I give you 4 other stock picks to capitalize on the revolution that is being televised in real-time.But now let’s get to the goodness of what analysts have done with sales and earnings estimates since Jensen &amp; Co. dropped their “demand-driven” bomb.Here’s how I described the situation in TAZR Trader on May 24…NVIDIA: It's the TAM, Stupid!Posted on 5/24/23TAZR Traders""How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.""Thomas Henry Huxley, upon hearing of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selectionNVIDIA (NVDA) blew some doors off tonight -- and not just for the bears.Yes, they raised guidance significantly. But so many investors and amateur analysts are still grappling to understand the significance of this juggernaut that I have called the King of AI for 6 years...Get Your ""MPA"" in Deep LearningMarch, 2017NVIDIA Gaming Drives the Deep Learning-AI RevolutionAugust 21, 2018Who Cares NVIDIA Makes Great Gaming Graphics?August 23, 2018And there are still so many amateurs who never understood those drivers then (or even yesterday) and still try to sound like experts now -- heck, they didn't even know what ""CUDA"" stood for last year!ChatGPT and NVDA shares' meteoric rise have made them all very interested ""experts"" now.And I bet they still didn't know tonight what Ampere, or Hopper, or Lovelace are. We know because we talk about them and I'm writing a book about ""13 Great Women of Science"" which includes Madames Hopper and Lovelace!Nor do they understand a DGX, or a ""petaflop,"" much less a ""massively parallel architecture"" used for deep learning training and inference.It's almost comical, if it weren't so sad. Next, when CRISPR stocks go meteor, they'll be all about them too.Anyway, my point is to be careful about the analysis you hear over the next few days and weeks as the arm-chair AI experts tell you why or why not NVDA shares should trade at any given valuation of 100X or 200X EPS.As you know, I've traded NVDA from extreme valuations of 5X sales (realllly cheap) up to 30X sales (pretttty expensive).And as I told our internal strategy group tonight in a chat...""P/E for NVDA doesn't matter as they dominate a TAM (total addressable market) that is hard to calculate right now. Is it $300 billion? $500B? (Some projections are for $2 trillion by 2030 and I think that is conservative.) So it can grow into a 20X sales valuation for a while. Imagine the transition from datacenters that were CPU-centric (serial processing) and devoid of software for training &amp; inference. GPU A100 and H100 cards set the standard now as massively parallel architectures in DGX machines (8 cards with 50+ billion transistors). The one they built for Tesla that does 1.8 exaflops stacks hundreds of DGX boxes (basically a 2-foot cube). Every corp will want one now. That's tens of thousands of $68,000 machines. CUDA has been the development platform they didn't know they needed for design, engineering, data crunching and simulation.""What do we mean when we talk about doing a billion or a trillion calculations per second?Just like a million million equals a trillion, so too a billion billion equals a quintillion.  Coming to terms: FLOP stands for ""floating point operations per second."" An exaflop is a measure of performance for a supercomputer that can calculate at least 10 to the 18th power, or one quintillion, FLOPS.In mid 2022, CEO Jensen Huang guesstimated a TAM for NVIDIA of $300 billion in hardware and $300 billion in software. This is the defining projection for the CUDA hard+soft stack I've been preaching about for 6 years.I think Jensen has been so conservative because it would blow the minds of even professional analysts to think about what is possible.Imagine NVDA growing to just 3X a $600 billion TAM where it would still be the dominant player...That would be a $1.5 trillion valuation minimum. See you soon above $1T.(end of May 24 TAZR commentary excerpt)Architect of the AI SupercomputerI used to talk 5 years ago about how much NVIDIA’s revenue could grow as they sold DGX boxes for $68,000. That’s the “mini” supercomputer in a 2-cubic foot space with 400 to 500 billion transistors for machine learning (ML)  applications -- depending on what generation of GPU card is used, from Volta to Ampere to Hopper. The A100 system-on-a-chip GPU costs $10,000 each.A single DGX box is capable of massive computing power of between 1 to 5 petaFLOPS. A petaFLOP is a billion million floating point operations per second, so you can imagine how many you need to build a supercomputer like the one at Tesla.Here’s a good description from software consulting firm Run:ai of what a user gets for their investment in a single DGX box…“Beyond the powerful hardware they provide, DGX systems come out of the box with an optimized operating system and a complete pre-integrated environment for running deep learning projects. They provide a containerized software architecture that lets data scientists easily deploy the deep learning frameworks and management tools they need with minimal setup or configuration.”To build a corporate, university, or scientific R&amp;D lab supercomputer, you need between 100 and 1,000 of these dynamic cubes, “stacked” together to form “massively parallel architectures.”Now a DGX box costs anywhere from $100,000 to $150,000. Not to mention the value-enriching capabilities of the full CUDA hardware+software stack.And every major enterprise wants 100 to 1,000 of them now that ChatGPT took center stage. They either need to capitalize on the “chatterbox that ate the internet,” or exceed it.THIS is the math you need to understand to grasp how and why Wall Street analysts underestimated NVIDIA sales potential, even after ChatGPT.And they are just catching up with these potential topline moves…Fiscal year 2024 (ends January ‘24): $42.64 billion = 58% growthFiscal year 2025 (ends January ‘25): $54.70 billion = 28% growthThese are dramatic turnarounds from where revenue projections were only a few months ago when I wrote my ChatGPT report.Back in mid-March, FY24 sales were cast at around $30 billion and FY25 was around $37 billion. But you were already starting to see the optimism being expressed in those 12-24 months forward estimates as ChatGPT caught like wildfire and NVIDIA was inking deals left and right with partners like Microsoft.In fact, the day I published that ChatGPT report on March 20 was the start of the greatest computing event of the year, the NVIDIA GPU Tech Conference, or GTC. Jensen &amp; Co. are always full of surprises that wow the tech crowd and this was no disappointment.NVIDIA launched DGX Cloud, where users can rent access for $37,000 per month. And they unveiled DGX GH200, a large-memory AI supercomputer that uses NVIDIA NVLink to combine up to 256 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips into a single data-center sized GPU. Google Cloud, Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are already the first customers.This was one of the primary drivers in the dramatic leap in sales estimates for this year and next.What Price-to-Sales Valuation Do We Have Now?On current-year estimates we have $1 trillion/$42 billion = 23.8 times.On next year estimates of $55 billion, we have 18X.To me, that’s a BUY based on everything I’ve presented.Regarding misplaced P/E ratios, when NVDA EPS FY25 estimates were at only $6 a month ago (before their quarterly report), the stock was trading at 50X EPS.Then when shares launched above $400 after earnings on May 24, allMay the valuation hand-wringers started screaming about 100X and even 200X earnings. But, again, they were looking backwards at trailing EPS. In the worst possible view of earnings, some are looking at fully-diluted TTM (trailing 12 months) EPS of $2.19. In the best possible TTM view, they are using around $3.35 non-GAAP.Right now, the FY24 EPS consensus is for $7.64 and FY25 is over $10, putting the forward PE somewhere around 50 times.For a conservative view of these numbers, let’s hear from analysts at Stifel Nicolaus where they have a $370 price target and Hold rating on shares…“We continue to view NVDA as amongst the best-positioned companies to benefit from accelerated AI-focused spending. With shares trading well above the company's 5-year average multiple on a forward earnings basis at 54.2x our F2024 EPS estimate and 50.4x our F2025 estimate, versus average multiples of 42x and 35x, respectively, we believe strong near-term momentum is well understood.”I’m not saying NVDA is cheap. But the world has finally woken up to its AI potential and you may never get the chance to buy it at 10X sales again. Maybe 15X sales during a correction, or after an earnings miss. So don't blink if you see a $750 billion market cap. Just buy.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Where can a Chinese buyer purchase top-end Nvidia AI chips in the wake of U.S. sanctions?Visiting the famed Huaqiangbei electronics area in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen is a good bet - in particular, the SEG Plaza skyscraper whose first 10 floors are crammed with shops selling everything from camera parts to drones. The chips are not advertised but asking discreetly works.They don't come cheap. Two vendors there, who spoke with Reuters in person on condition of anonymity, said they could provide small numbers of A100 artificial intelligence chips made by the U.S. chip designer, pricing them at $20,000 a piece - double the usual price.While buying or selling high-end U.S. chips is not illegal in China, U.S. export restrictions have created a de facto underground market with vendors keen not to draw scrutiny from either U.S. or Chinese authorities.President Joe Biden's administration in September ordered Nvidia to stop exporting its two most advanced chips - the A100 and the recently developed H100 - to mainland China and Hong Kong, part of efforts to stymie Chinese AI and supercomputing development amid intensifying political and trade tensions. That was then followed up with an array of semiconductor-related export controls.But, as AI booms across the globe after the runaway success of OpenAI's ChatGPT, demand for high-end chips has rocketed, particularly for Nvidia's microprocessors which are widely regarded as the best at handling machine-learning tasks.""We are talking with two vendors now to get some,"" said Ivan Lau, co-founder of Hong Kong's Pantheon Lab who is trying to purchase 2-4 new A100 cards to run the startup's latest AI models.Those vendors, who bought the chips outside the U.S., were quoting HK$150,000 ($19,150) per card, he said, adding: ""They told us straight up that there will be no warranty or support.""Story continuesReuters spoke with 10 vendors in Hong Kong and mainland China who described being able to easily procure small numbers of A100s. Their information highlighted both intense demand in China for the chips and the relative ease with which Washington's sanctions can be circumvented for small-batch transactions.Reuters was not able to estimate overall volumes of Nvidia A100 and H100 chips flowing into China or learn to what extent the transactions taking place go towards satisfying demand.Buyers are typically app developers, startups, researchers or gamers, the vendors said, declining to be identified because the imports contravene U.S. trade restrictions. One vendor said buyers also included Chinese local authorities.Nvidia said in a statement to Reuters it did not allow exports of the A100 or H100 to China, instead providing reduced-capability substitutes that comply with U.S. law.""If we receive information that a customer is breaching their agreement with us and exporting restricted products in violation of the law, we would take immediate and appropriate action,"" the statement said.A U.S. Department of Commerce spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters that export control measures have had a ""substantial impact"" on China's availability of high-end chips.The statement also said reports of parties seeking to obtain these chips through illicit means were ""not a surprise"", adding that ""allegations of violations are investigated"".China's State Council Information Office and China's industry ministry did not respond to requests for comment.Nvidia said in September that $400 million in sales during its third quarter could be lost if Chinese firms decided not to buy alternative Nvidia products.Its new China-tailored slower variants - the A800 and H800 - developed to cushion that impact are now being bought by large Chinese tech firms such as Tencent Holdings and Alibaba, which have deep pockets to purchase huge quantities.OFFERINGS ONLINEThe Chinese vendors said they procured the chips primarily in two ways: snatching up excess stock that finds its way to the market after Nvidia ships large quantities to big U.S. firms, or importing through companies locally incorporated in places such as India, Taiwan and Singapore.This means the quantities they can secure are small, far from what's needed to build a sophisticated AI large language model from scratch.A model similar to OpenAI's GPT would require more than 30,000 Nvidia A100 cards, according to research firm TrendForce. But a handful can run complex machine-learning tasks and enhance existing AI models.According to an electronics procurement website that listed some 40 sellers of A100s, most were located in the Huaqiangbei electronics area. But listings for A100s could also be found on Alibaba's Taobao e-commerce site, on Xiaohongshu which is similar to Instagram, as well as on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.Alibaba, Xiaohongshu and Douyin-owner ByteDance did not respond to requests for comment.Some of the vendors cautioned that fraud had become common with refurbished chips being passed off as A100s.Nvidia's more advanced H100 chips, only on the market since March, appear much harder to come by.Vinci Chow, a lecturer in economics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong whose department has procured four A100 cards from local vendors for research purposes, said he had been told some packs of eight H100 chips were available for purchase.But only one of the 10 vendors Reuters spoke with said they could procure H100s.The U.S. is likely not too bothered about small transactions of the chips, said Charlie Chai, a Shanghai-based analyst at 86Research.""Only if/when China poses a greater threat following significant catch-ups will we see more strict enforcement,"" he said.He added the premiums currently commanded by Chinese vendors for A100 and H100 chips could collapse in the future as many of the Chinese AI startups that were driving purchases would eventually withdraw from the market.

In the past year, the stock has gained 9.2%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 20.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBusiness TailwindsRiding on strong net earned premiums and an aggregate underlying combined ratio for Business Insurance and Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, strong underwriting results continued in the commercial businesses. High levels of retention, improved pricing, an increase in new business and a positive renewal premium change should continue to drive Travelers.Travelers’ commercial businesses continue to perform well on the back of stability in the markets where it operates as well as the execution of its strategies. For 2023, the insurer expects renewal premium change to be modestly at a higher level throughout the remainder of 2023. In domestic homeowners and other, TRV expects renewal premium change to remain at an elevated level through the end of the year.Higher average levels of invested assets, reliable results from the fixed-income portfolio and strong returns from the non-fixed income portfolio are likely to drive the metric higher. Travelers raised the outlook for fixed income net investment income, including earnings from short-term securities to $530 million after tax in the second quarter, to an estimated $555 million in the third quarter and then to around $575 million in the fourth quarter.Travelers maintains a conservative balance sheet among its peers. TRV aims to generate increased earnings and capital, maintain a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and growing book value per share over time as part of its long-term financial strategy. Balance sheet strength driven by scale, profitability and cash flow support it to invest more than $1 billion annually on technology.Sustained operational excellence helped generate double-digit core return on equity (ROE) in nine of the past 10 years, averaging 12.6%. The company aims to generate mid-teens core ROE over time.Travelers has an impressive dividend history, increasing its dividend for the last 18 years. Its current dividend yield of 2.2% is better than the industry average of 0.3%.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this entertainment company have returned 0% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. The Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, to which Disney belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Disney is expected to post earnings of $1.04 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.5%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.20 indicates a change of +35.6% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Disney.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DIS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Disney, the consensus sales estimate of $22.63 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.2%. The $89.65 billion and $94.29 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.4% and +5.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDisney reported revenues of $21.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.3%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.03%. The EPS surprise was +4.49%.Over the last four quarters, Disney surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Disney is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

The Company determined that there were deficiencies in historical financial information in relation to the Company's live streaming business, where the revenue and direct costs were understated. These adjustments also resulted in an increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. This was mainly due to the deficiencies in the records of international revenue in China, Middle East and Southeast Asia. The key adjustments to the previously filed financial information includes:Increase in revenue from $15,962,345 to $21,290,903.Increase in gross profit from $1,558,616 to $2,323,184.Increase in net loss from $3,599,916 to $4,910,205.Further details of the restatement are set forth in amended and restated audited financial statements and amended management discussion and analysis for the year ended February 28, 2021 filed on www.sedar.com.To download Hello Pal, Language Pal, Travel Pal or the proprietary Phrasebooks please visit the IOS or Android store.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned +1.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has gained 7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share, indicating a change of -46.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.14 points to a change of -26.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -4.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.63 indicates a change of +7.9% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -29.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.11 billion and $16.61 billion estimates indicate -16% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $3.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.3%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.65%. The EPS surprise was +5.04%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

123,2fc21a23-c2b3-3aba-bc6e-755b4d9cb923,URI,2023-06-20,3 Stocks These AI-Powered ETFs Are Betting On,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-ai-powered-etfs-100005152.html,1686736805,STORY,"['URI', 'WSM', 'DKS']","[Given how popular artificial intelligence (AI) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become in 2023, it’s not surprising that AI-powered ETF stock picks have also gained traction with investors.The first ETF to apply AI and machine learning to the entire investment process was the AI Powered Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:AIEQ), launched by EquBot LLC in October 2017 in partnership with ETF Managers Group.  “ETFs have made beta ‘smart,’ but with AIEQ we’re looking to make investing intelligent,” EquBot Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Co-Founder Chida Khatua said at the time of the launch. “EquBot AI Technology with Watson [IBM] has the ability to mimic an army of equity research analysts working around the clock, 365 days a year, while removing human error and bias from the process.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKhatua remains the CEO of EquBot, which now has more than $4 billion in assets across the company’s portfolios-as-a-service (PaaS) platform. AIEQ uses AI technology to build predictive models to evaluate 6,000 U.S. companies and identify approximately 30 to 200 stocks with the greatest appreciation potential over the next 12 months. So, there is perhaps no better place to look for stocks chosen by AI ETFs than in AIEQ’s top 10 holdings. Below are the three I like most. United Rentals (URI)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for United Rentals (URI).Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comUnited Rentals (NYSE:URI) is AIEQ’s second-largest holding, with a weighting of 3.6%. URI stock is up nearly 47% over the past year, compared with an 11% return for the S&amp;P 500. On June 8, Morgan Stanley analyst Dillon Cumming raised his price target for URI to $428, which is about 4% higher than where it’s currently trading. Of the 23 analysts who cover the industrial and construction equipment rental company, 15 rate it “outperform” or “buy” with a $465.11 average target price, implying upside of around 13%. In 2022, the global construction equipment rental market was valued at $92.4 billion. It’s expected to grow to $133.7 billion by 2029, a compound annual growth rate of 4.2%. Story continuesAs the company’s May 2023 investor presentation points out, United Rentals currently has the largest market share in the U.S. of any single company in the industry with 17%. That said, the top three companies in the space only control 34% of the market, leaving a lot of room for expansion. Over the past 10 years, United Rentals has generated $12.8 billion in cumulative free cash flow with an average free cash flow margin of 16.3%. In 2022, it had $1.77 billion in free cash flow. Management is forecasting free cash flow of $2.23 billion in 2023 at the midpoint of its guidance. Based on a market capitalization of $28.3 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 7.9%, which is right on the cusp of what I consider to be value territory (8% and above). Williams-Sonoma (WSM)Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mallSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comWilliams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) has been moving sideways over the past year and has underperformed the broader market with a 7% gain. It’s possible investors’ hesitancy has stemmed from the fact that the retailer’s products are discretionary in nature while a potential recession looms over the country.Williams-Sonoma reported Q1 2023 results at the end of May. Comparable brand revenue declined 6% year over year. As a result of the sales decline, operating income fell 30% from a year ago to $226 million. However, Q1 2022 was a solid quarter, with comparable growth of 9.5%, so a retreat in the latest quarter was not unexpected. Moreover, its two-year comparable growth was 3.5%, and its four-year comparable growth was 46.5%. For all of 2023, management expects revenue to be flat at the midpoint of its guidance, with an operating margin of 14.5%. Over the long haul, it expects “mid-to-high single-digit annual net revenue growth with operating margin above 15%.”In May, the company launched GreenRow, a new brand focused on “modern heirlooms,” utilizing its in-house design team. Who knows if it will be the next Pottery Barn, but the company keeps innovating.WSM is AIEQ’s fifth-largest holding, with a weighting of 3.2%. So, while it’s been a lackluster investment over the past 12 months, the AI powering the ETF thinks this trend will reverse over the next year.Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)Exterior of Dick's Sporting Goods retail store including sign and logo.Source: George Sheldon via ShutterstockDick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) is AIEQ’s ninth-largest holding, with a weighting of 2.6%. The retailer recently announced a marketing campaign across all media platforms — TV, online and social media — with Nike (NYSE:NKE) entitled “Sports Change Lives.” The shot across Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) likely happened because Dick’s has a much stronger omnichannel business with 65% of its customers shopping both online and in store versus 7% of Foot Locker’s customers. Dick’s also generates far more revenue from its loyalty program than Foot Locker does. In May, Dick’s reported healthy Q1 results, with same-store sales up 3.4%, net sales up 5.3% year over year to $2.84 billion and adjusted earnings per share up 19% to $3.40. It’s also important to note that the company reduced its total debt in the quarter to $1.48 billion, down 24% from a year ago. With higher interest rates, retailers must cut debt as much as possible. And it continued repurchasing shares, buying back $57.7 million worth of its stock.Management reaffirmed its 2023 guidance, projecting same-store sales growth of up to 2% with $13.35 a share in earnings at the midpoint. Shares currently trade at 10.1 times forward earnings. Dick’s Sporting Goods remains a well-run organization with longtime former CEO Ed Stack serving as executive chairman, and Lauren Hobart, who has been with the company since 2011, as CEO.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

One of the first cloud offerings designed to address the EU's emerging regulatory landscape, Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud gives customers the services and capabilities of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's (OCI) public cloud regions with the same prices, support, and service level agreements (SLAs) to run all workloads. Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud is located entirely within the EU, supported by EU-based personnel, and operated by separate legal entities incorporated within the EU. Part of OCI's distributed cloud strategy, EU Sovereign Cloud provides a new option to help meet regulatory requirements, complementing hybrid and dedicated cloud strategies.Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud is well-suited to host digital businesses operating in heavily regulated industries. Customers with data and applications that are sensitive, regulated, or of strategic regional importance, as well as workloads that fall under EU guidelines and requirements for sovereignty and data privacy, such as the general data protection regulation (GDPR), can now move to the cloud. EU Sovereign Cloud will help digital transformation efforts across critical industries such as healthcare, financial services (including banking and insurance), telecommunications, and the public sector, as customers' hosted data remains within the EU member states and the cloud regions are operated solely by EU-based personnel. Please visit oraclecloud.eu to learn more.Story continues""The European Union technology landscape has changed dramatically due to the growing importance of data protection and localization, leading to increased demand for sovereign cloud solutions that can securely host sensitive customer data and comply with regulations such as GDPR,"" said Richard Smith, executive vice president, Technology, EMEA, Oracle. ""Our goal is to meet customers wherever they are in their cloud journey and with Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud, customers in highly regulated industries, as well as those subject to certain country-specific legislation, can now accelerate their cloud strategies.""Delivers the Same Services as Oracle's Public Cloud at the Same PriceAvailable for customers in all 27 member states of the EU and globally, Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud offers 100+ cloud services available in Oracle's public cloud with no premium fees for the sovereignty capabilities, and with the same SLAs on performance, management, and availability. Oracle customers can also gain access to other customer programs such as Oracle Support Rewards. In addition, Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite, which is currently available in the EU Restricted Access (EURA) offering, is planned to be available in the Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud soon.Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud also helps organizations in regulated industries and governments embrace new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as generative AI. Organizations have faced major challenges that prevented the use of existing generative AI offerings, including data residency and regulatory requirements preventing them from leveraging AI infrastructure in the public cloud to develop the models required for generative AI. By offering the services and capabilities of Oracle's public cloud, Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud enables public sector organizations to use AI infrastructure in a cloud that aligns with EU data residency and sovereignty requirements.Designed and Operated for EU Data Privacy and SovereigntyThe new sovereign cloud region operates under a comprehensive set of policies and governance that further enhance OCI's existing internal capabilities for data residency, security, privacy, and compliance. These policies include a framework for data and operational sovereignty, including how OCI stores and manages access to data, and how data access from entities outside the EU are handled. The Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud data centers are located in the EU (Frankfurt, Germany and Madrid, Spain), and they are owned and operated by separate Oracle-owned EU legal entities incorporated within the EU, with operations and customer support restricted to EU-based personnel. Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud builds on Oracle Cloud's existing compliance programs that enable customers to demonstrate adherence to regional and industry regulations. It also aligns with EU monitoring regulations, and guidance that limits data transfers out of the EU (such as Court of Justice for EU Schrems II Ruling and European Data Protection Board).In addition, OCI's extensive network of more than 85 global and regional OCI FastConnect partners offers organizations dedicated connectivity to Oracle Cloud Regions and OCI services. Digital Realty is the host partner for the EU Sovereign Cloud region location in Madrid, and Equinix is the host partner for the region location in Frankfurt. FastConnect partners available at launch include Arelion, DE-CIX, Digital Realty, Equinix, and InterCloud.Separated Architecture Helps Enforce Data Security and Strengthens SovereigntyOracle EU Sovereign Cloud is designed for data residency and security with an architecture that shares no infrastructure with Oracle's commercial regions in the EU and that has no backbone network connection to Oracle's other cloud regions. Customer access to Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud is managed separately from access to Oracle Cloud's commercial regions.Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud is designed for high availability within each cloud region and consists of two cloud regions to support disaster recovery architectures within the boundaries of the EU. Each region comprises three fault domains to help avoid grouping workloads on the same physical hardware. Consequently, any hardware failure or compute hardware maintenance in only one fault domain will not impact instances located in other fault domains.With operations, support, and policies that are distinct from Oracle's commercial cloud, Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud helps streamline and simplify customer compliance with EU data privacy and sovereignty guidelines and requirements. In addition, by ensuring that customer data is contained within the EU without requiring additional customer configuration via complex policy tools, Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud helps accelerate customer deployments while lowering risk.New OCI Key Management Services Provide Additional Layer of Data Protection and Help Customers Meet Compliance Requirements To help customers further secure their data and address data sovereignty requirements, OCI is introducing two new key management services available across all Oracle Cloud Regions, including EU Sovereign Cloud: OCI Dedicated Key Management Service and OCI External Key Management Service.OCI External Key Management is built in partnership with the Thales Group and lets customers encrypt their data using encryption keys that are created and managed by the customer outside of OCI. These encryption keys always stay within custody of the customer and are never imported into OCI, enabling customers to move regulated workloads to OCI that require control over the physical storage of keys outside the cloud. OCI Dedicated Key Management gives customers control over their encryption keys by using a dedicated, single-tenant Hardware Security Module (HSM) provisioned within OCI.Customers, Partners, and Analysts Welcome Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud""Having cloud services with data centers that are located in the EU and operated, updated, and supported by EU residents, while maintaining isolation from non-EU cloud regions, is an important part of our cloud adoption,"" said Jarkko Levasma, government CIO, director general, Ministry of Finance of Finland. ""This will open up possibilities to adopt infrastructure, platform, and software as a service in Finland for the government.""""Oracle is one of Telefónica Tech's strategic partners and we are collaborating on numerous cloud projects, supporting the digitalization of the economy,"" said María Jesús Almazor, CEO, cyber security and cloud, Telefónica Tech. ""Oracle's commitment to Spain, launching a region in our geography, and its sovereign cloud strategy across Europe is very good news for our customers throughout the EU, as sovereignty is key to the digitalization of regulated industries.""""At DXC we want to congratulate Oracle for the upcoming launch of the EU Sovereign Cloud. This initiative removes barriers to the adoption of cloud services by customers that until now have not been able to embrace cloud, as they were subject to strict compliance restrictions on data processing,"" said Jorge Pastana, alliances &amp; cloud business development director, DXC Technology. ""With this new offering, Oracle further facilitates access to high-quality and secure solutions, allowing both private and public organizations to take full advantage of the benefits of the cloud without compromising the integrity and confidentiality of information. It is a remarkable achievement that will fuel technological advancement and strengthen confidence in the digital age.""""This is a major announcement that has great significance for the Oracle / Kyndryl alliance and will help us leverage Oracle's cloud technology. It will remove some of the barriers to public cloud adoption through the concept of sovereign cloud and will comply with regulations and data governance,"" said David Soto, president, Spain and Portugal, Kyndryl. ""At Kyndryl, we believe that this announcement and our strong partnership will enable us to help our customers and reinforce our position as a market leader in mission-critical systems management and transformation services.""""IDC continues to see significant growth in the use of public cloud for mission-critical workloads across major industries. At the same time, data protection laws as well as other regulations that mandate compliance also continue to evolve,"" said Rahiel Nasir, associate research director, European cloud practice, IDC. ""All this requires organizations to have greater visibility and control over strategic data assets across their operations. Sovereign cloud services, such as Oracle's EU Sovereign Cloud, are designed to give enterprises greater control and protection of their critical data assets. They also aim to help customer organizations comply with data residency rules and regulatory requirements while continuing to take full advantage of the benefits of cloud and digital transformation.""""Omdia's data shows that organizations are increasingly adopting a strategic cloud strategy, such as multicloud infrastructure. This approach is helping businesses across Europe digitalize their operations and drive innovation. But the rise of multicloud does present new challenges for enterprises – especially industries impacted by increasing regulation or jurisdictional control of data,"" said Roy Illsey, chief analyst, Omdia. ""Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud addresses European data privacy and sovereignty requirements in all 27 EU member states and is designed to support businesses in heavily regulated industries looking after sensitive data and applications as well as workloads that fall under EU privacy requirements.""Oracle Cloud's Rapidly Growing Global FootprintThe new EU Sovereign Cloud is part of OCI's distributed cloud strategy. OCI can address customer requirements by deploying cloud services to specific locations with flexible performance, security, compliance, and operational models. Oracle provides a broad and consistent set of cloud infrastructure services across 44 commercial and government cloud regions in 23 countries to serve its growing global customer base. OCI currently operates 37 commercial regions and seven government regions, in addition to multiple dedicated and national security regions.About OCI's Distributed CloudOCI's distributed cloud offers customers the benefits of cloud with greater control over data residency, locality, and authority, even across multiple clouds.

The company is likely to make an announcement this week while India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, visits the United States, cited some anonymous sources. The Indian prime minister is starting his formal visit to the country on Jun 21.One of the anonymous persons stated that the amount invested may rise up to $2 billion from $1 billion. Nonetheless, it might also occur that the concerned company does not close the deal. This move is expected to expand Micron’s global footprint amid the ongoing tensions between the United States and China. It would further create an opportunity to strengthen Washington’s key supply chains outside of China.Last week, Micron promised to invest 4.3 billion yuan ($603 million) over the next few years in its chip packaging plant in China. Per the plan, the semiconductor company will be adding assembly lines at its existing chip packaging facility in the Chinese city of Xian. The investment will also include the acquisition of packaging equipment from a Xian-based subsidiary of Taiwan's Powertech Technology.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMicron stated that the investment plan in China would create an additional 500 jobs, which will bring the company’s total workforce to more than 4,500 in the country.These investment plans came weeks after the Cyberspace Administration of China imposed a trade restriction on selling Micron products in key domestic industries on national security concerns. In a statement released on May 21, China’s cybersecurity regulator revealed that the U.S.-based memory chipmaker failed to pass a cybersecurity review, which it initiated in late March 2023.The trade restrictions on Micron chips can be seen as a retaliatory action by the Chinese government against the U.S. government’s increasing restrictions on Chinese access to critical and more advanced semiconductor technology. In October 2022, the United States imposed an export ban on certain advanced chips used in data centers for artificial intelligence, data analytics and computing applications. Over the past few months, Netherlands and Japan also joined the United States to restrict China from making advanced chips.Story continuesIn May, the company revealed its plan to invest up to 500 billion yen ($3.70 billion) in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology over the next few years in Japan. Micron will be the first semiconductor company to bring the state-of-the-art technology to Japan for production. It expects to ramp EUV into production on the 1-gamma node in Taiwan and Japan from 2025 onward.However, the equivalent actions could jeopardize Micron’s prospects, which are already facing the brunt of the weak demand for its memory chips. Chip sales in China make up approximately 11% of Micron’s total revenues.In late March, Micron reported weaker-than-expected financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $1.91 per share, which was significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents. The bottom line compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $2.14 per share.The quarterly revenues of Micron plunged 53% year over year to $3.69 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $3.76 billion. The rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets amid macroeconomic uncertainty were the main reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMicron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of MU have gained 21.4% over the past year.Some better-ranked stocks from the broader Computer and Technology sector are Meta Platforms META, ServiceNow NOW and Dropbox DBX, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

GMS is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Jun 22, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.5% but rose 6.3% year over year.

The estimated figure indicates an 8.6% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s level. The consensus mark for net sales is pegged at $1.27 billion, suggesting a 1.4% fall from the year-ago reported figure.GMS Inc. Price and EPS Surprise GMS Inc. price-eps-surprise | GMS Inc. Quote Key Factors to NoteGMS is likely to have generated lower earnings and sales in the fiscal fourth quarter, thanks to moderate housing demand and repair and remodeling activities. It has also been witnessing inflation and supply-related challenges concerning some of its products.GMS has been witnessing a decline in Single-family demand across most of the markets served due to a slowdown in permits and starts activity and a reduced construction backlog.The company expects sales to be flat to down in low-single-digits for the quarter. Wallboard volumes are expected to be up more than 20% in Multi-family, increase single digit in Commercial and be down in high-teens in Single-family.It also projects mid- to high-teen inflation in wallboard pricing, flat prices in ceilings and slight inflation in complementary products for the fiscal fourth quarter. Steel Framing pricing is likely to decline by 20-25%.GMS anticipates gross margin to be nearly 32% and adjusted EBITDA within $139-$144 million. In the year-ago period, gross margin was 32% and adjusted EBITDA was $154.2 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ceiling products’ sales is pegged at $143 million, down from $149 million reported a year ago.

131,e154d4a1-1ea6-359b-8af4-213ff2712261,MCD,2023-06-20,Is It Worth Investing in McDonald's (MCD) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-mcdonalds-mcd-based-133007825.html,1687181407,STORY,['MCD'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about McDonald's (MCD).McDonald's currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.66, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.66 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.7% and 10.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCDCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for McDonald's here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying McDonald's, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in MCD?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $11.05.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for McDonald's may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A misplaced fastener can chafe alternator cable insulation. No injuries or deaths have resulted.On certain Model 579 trucks equipped with a Paccar MX-13 engine and Paccar 160-amp alternator, the alternator positive cable may chafe against the left-hand side front spring bracket top rearward fastener. The head of fastener may be outside of the frame rail.If the cable was routed too close to the left-hand front spring bracket top rearward fastener, a fire could result.All recalled trucks are suspected to have the condition, for which there is no warning.Peterbilt began an investigation May 11 after learning of a customer with an underhood fire. A warranty claim search found the other fires leading. The Peterbilt Safety Committee decided June 6 to conduct a recall.Paccar dealers will replace at no charge the frame fastener and install it in the opposite direction inside the frame rail and secure the alternator cable, creating greater routing clearance. The Denton, Texas, plant made a running change on July 29, 2022, to turn around the front of frame bracket fasteners.Dealers and owners will be notified of the recall Aug. 11.

(NYSE: NI) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, Blackstone's (NYSE: BX) dedicated Infrastructure group, for the Blackstone Infrastructure affiliate to acquire a 19.9% equity interest in NIPSCO for $2.150 billion.Blackstone Infrastructure is an active perpetual capital investor across the utility, energy transition, transportation, digital infrastructure, water and waste infrastructure sectors. Blackstone Infrastructure seeks to apply a long-term buy-and-hold approach to large-scale infrastructure assets and is focused on responsible stewardship and stakeholder engagement to create value for its investors and the communities it serves. Blackstone Infrastructure is committed to investing behind NIPSCO's energy transition and decarbonization programs, as well as helping to increase gas and electric grid resiliency for the customers of Indiana.The transaction is a highly attractive and efficient form of equity financing. NiSource intends to use the capital infusion to support its fastest growing utility and its ability to serve customers, de-lever its balance sheet and fund ongoing capital needs associated with the renewable generation transition underway. Since 2018, NIPSCO has been executing on one of the fastest transitions from coal-fired electricity in the U.S. utilities sector, targeting 0% coal-fired generation mix by 2028 (compared to 75% coal generation mix in 2018). Through 2030, NIPSCO expects to invest approximately $3.5 billion in electric generation transition investments, with this investment primarily focused on installing new renewable generation to replace coal-fired generation retirements. NIPSCO also intends to support the continued growth and modernization of its gas and electric transmission and distribution systems, which will play critical roles in the energy transition as NIPSCO continues to deliver a reliable, diverse and sustainable energy mix, bringing customer, environmental and economic benefits.Story continuesThe transaction implies an equity value of $10.8 billion and enterprise value of $14.3 billion for 100% of NIPSCO. Upon closing of the transaction, which is expected by the end of 2023, NIPSCO will remain a vital part of NiSource, which will retain an 80.1% stake in NIPSCO. NiSource will continue to operate NIPSCO; Blackstone will receive minority rights that are commensurate with its 19.9% equity ownership interest. As part of the transaction, Blackstone is committed to funding its pro rata share of ongoing capital requirements, which is supported by a $250 million equity commitment letter and contractual obligations.""We're pleased to reach this agreement at a compelling valuation following a robust and competitive process and are confident that Blackstone is the right partner for NIPSCO and NiSource going forward, given its global footprint and deep infrastructure experience, including in renewable development and procurement,"" said NiSource president and CEO Lloyd Yates. ""With this transaction, our commitment to Indiana remains unchanged, and we will be able to drive further sustainable growth for our stakeholders. This financing transaction will have no impact on NIPSCO's current strategic direction or on our commitment to our gas and electric customers in Indiana.""""This agreement underscores Blackstone's commitment to decarbonization to create value for our investors and our desire to help facilitate the reindustrialization of the Midwest,"" said Sean Klimczak, Global Head of Infrastructure, Blackstone. ""Our belief in Indiana remains steadfast and we are excited to partner with NiSource and NIPSCO, one of the fastest growing utilities in the country, to support the vital role that NIPSCO plays in communities across Northern Indiana.""""This transaction is a significant step in our execution against our strategy, and the progress we are making to create value for all of our stakeholders as we continue to navigate the current challenging interest rate backdrop,"" said Shawn Anderson, NiSource's executive vice president and CFO. ""We are confident this is the right path forward to strengthen our balance sheet, support our financing plan and provide greater flexibility to execute on high-quality capital investments that will enhance the safety, reliability and sustainability of our systems for the benefit of our customers.""NIPSCO is Indiana's largest vertically integrated electric and gas distribution company, providing critical utility service to almost 1.3 million customers in an economically robust service territory, with a proven track record of providing value for its customers. NIPSCO is at the forefront of the energy transition and is developing one of the lowest-cost portfolios of renewable energy projects, the majority of which are utility-owned, and intends to retire all coal-fired generation by the end of 2028. These near-term renewable and generation transition investments add to a multi-decade capital plan with the goal to significantly grow NIPSCO's rate base through investments across gas, electric transmission and distribution and electric generation, which should drive significant continued value for NIPSCO's customers. NIPSCO operates in Indiana, one of the most constructive utility jurisdictions in the United States, with strong support for utility-owned generation and affordable energy, and a strong economic service territory benefitting from on-shoring and migration trends as well as robust development.Mike Hooper, president and chief operating officer of NIPSCO said, ""This partnership with Blackstone is a reflection of NIPSCO's potential as an industry leader as we continue to meet the increasing and evolving needs of our gas and electric customers across Northern Indiana. Once completed, this transaction will also strengthen our ability to invest in major renewable generation projects and make capital enhancements to existing electric and gas infrastructure to add resiliency to our system. We will be better positioned than ever to provide safe, reliable and diverse sources of energy to our customers and support the future growth and development of the communities we are privileged to serve.""Sebastien Sherman, Senior Managing Director, Blackstone Infrastructure, said, ""We are excited to invest behind NIPSCO, which is leading the transformation of energy infrastructure in the U.S., advancing new, cleaner technologies and building increasingly advanced systems to meet customer needs. They are at the forefront of the transition to low-cost renewable energy and have one of the nation's fastest decarbonization plans.""The transaction is expected to close by year-end 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including receiving FERC approvals and clearances.Reaffirming 2023 and Long-term Earnings GuidanceNiSource also reaffirmed its non-GAAP NOEPS guidance of $1.54 to $1.60 in 2023, growth of 6-8% through 2027 and its FFO/debt target of 14-16%.

The company is not able to estimate the impact of such factors on their GAAP equivalents and, as such, is not providing such guidance on a GAAP basis. In addition, the company is not able to provide a reconciliation of its non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance or its funds from operations/debt guidance to their GAAP equivalent without unreasonable efforts. CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nisource-announces-agreement-to-sell-minority-equity-interest-in-nipsco-to-strengthen-financial-foundation-and-support-sustainable-long-term-growth-301855173.htmlSOURCE NiSource Inc.]"

Year to date, product lines across the vaccine business were up 9% in the fiscal third quarter, with notable growth in the Latin America region. Progress in the development pipeline of Companion Animal is encouraging. The expansion of Phibro’s business in key growth regions also buoys optimism.However, operating in a tough competitive space amid continued macroeconomic headwinds is concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 21.2% compared with the 18.1% fall of the industry and a 22.1% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned animal health and mineral nutrition company has a market capitalization of $559.8 million. PAHC carries an earnings yield of 8.97%, against the industry’s yield of -2.31%. Phibro delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 7.01% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayA Diversified Product Portfolio: Phibro’s key animal health products, which comprise MFAs (Medicated Feed Additives) and nutritional specialty products, facilitate enhancing animal nutrition. In the fiscal third quarter, the company witnessed the increased demand for MFAs in the United States and Latin America and Canada, along with the growing demand for processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry.In the last reported quarter, growth in nutritional specialties was led by higher domestic demand and higher selling prices for dairy products, along with growth in the companion animal product, Rejensa. The vaccine product business growth was driven by new registrations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA Prospering Vaccine Business: PAHC is focusing on new developments along with incremental registrations and the growing volumes of vaccine technologies. The company makes significant investments to expand vaccine manufacturing capacity at several locations.In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Phibro registered a 15% improvement in vaccine net sales, driven by increased demand and new product launches in Latin America.Story continuesPotential in Emerging Markets: Phibro’s existing operations and distribution network in more than 75 countries pave the path for global growth opportunities. Outside the United States, Phibro’s global footprint extends to countries where the livestock production growth rate is expected to be higher than the average growth rate. This includes Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Asia Pacific, Russia and former CIS countries, Mexico, Turkey, Australia, Canada, South Africa and other countries in Africa.DownsidesMacroeconomic Headwinds Mar Growth in Q3: Macroeconomic and operational challenges continue to dent Phibro’s profitability. In the fiscal third quarter, supply-chain disruptions were less common but still occurred. Meanwhile, PAHC posted a year-over-year decline in earnings. Higher SG&amp;A expenses negatively weighed on the company’s operating margin in the quarter under review.A Tough Competitive Landscape: Phibro’s competitive position is based principally on its product registrations, customer service and support, breadth of the product line, product quality, manufacturing technology, facility location, and product prices. A few of the company’s principal competitors include Bayer AG, Boehringer Ingelheim International GMBH, Eli Lilly and Company (Elanco Animal Health), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (Merck Animal Health and MSD Animal Health) and Zoetis Inc.Moreover, consolidation continues to rise in the animal health market.  This might work in favor of Phibro’s competitors.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Phibro’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $1.24 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $982.4 million.

141,36929948-d813-32be-8482-e2ea9d3e42bc,OXY,2023-06-20,Investors Heavily Search Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-occidental-petroleum-130010382.html,1687179610,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -1.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.07 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -66.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -48.2%. This estimate has changed -8.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.01 indicates a change of +24.1% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.28 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -32.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.84 billion and $31.34 billion estimates indicate -19.6% and +5.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $7.26 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.9%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.68%. The EPS surprise was -16.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NVRO is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its research and development (R&amp;D) edge. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and continued strength in its flagship Senza platform are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and dependence on third-party payors persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 40.3% against the 20.2% rise of the industry and 19.9% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $901.9 million. The company projects 31.5% growth for 2024 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Nevro’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average earnings surprise being 5.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.R&amp;D Edge: Nevro aims to continue to improve patient outcomes and expand patient access to HF10 therapy through enhancements to Senza and the development of newer indications, raising our optimism. Since the launch of the initial Senza system, the company introduced a number of product enhancements, like active anchors with improved performance, among others. The company continues to make enhancements to Senza to boost its performance.On the first-quarter earnings call in April, Nevro’s management stated that the company submitted the two-year data from its non-surgical back pain trial for publication.Strength in Senza: We are optimistic about Nevro’s continued strength in its flagship Senza platform. Based on analysis from the company’s SENZA- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and European studies, as well as the SENZA-PDN (Painful Diabetic Neuropathy) and SENZA-NSRBP (non-surgical refractory back pain) RCTs, Nevro believes the 10 kHz therapy can be an attractive treatment option for patients.In March, Nevro initiated the full-market release of the Senza HFX iQ System in the United States, which has received favorable feedback from physicians and patients.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Nevro’s better-than-expected first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company recorded an improvement in overall top-line results and robust domestic revenues. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures was also witnessed. The improvement in U.S. PDN trial procedures is also encouraging.DownsidesDependence on Third-Party Payors: Nevro’s success in marketing its products largely depends on whether U.S. and international government health administrative authorities, private health insurers and other organizations adequately cover and reimburse customers for the cost of its products. Access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for spinal cord stimulation procedures using Senza by third-party payors is essential for the acceptance of Nevro’s products by its customers.Stiff Competition: Nevro operates in a highly competitive medical device industry, which is subject to technological change. The company’s success depends partly upon its ability to establish a competitive position in the neuromodulation market by securing broad market acceptance of its HF10 therapy and Senza products for the treatment of approved chronic pain conditions.Estimate TrendNevro has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss has widened from $2.43 per share to $2.51.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $109.8 million, suggesting a 5.4% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past year, Hologic has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 20.7% compared with the industry’s 17.9% rise.Hologic delivered better-than-expected revenues and earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company’s Breast Health segment registered strong growth, driven by improving semiconductor chip supply, which enabled additional gantry deliveries within the quarter. This resulted in higher capital equipment revenues compared to the prior year period.Hologic has been making impressive progress in its Breast Health arm in recent times. The company is currently focusing on expanding its strategy to diversify its business across the patient continuum of care. It has also launched new software products based on its investments in artificial intelligence and strengthened its interventional franchise via the Brevera relaunch.Hologic, Inc. PriceHologic, Inc. PriceHologic, Inc. price | Hologic, Inc. QuoteThe GYN Surgical business grew organically as the company registered procedural volumes return and acceleration from new business lines. Moreover, the company raised the 2023 guidance, raising optimism about the stock.In Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continued to register strong growth during the fiscal second quarter. The growth was driven by the BV and CV/TV vaginitis panels and aided by the core sexually transmitted infection (STI) menu, including Clemidiagonrhia, Human papillomavirus (HPV) and Trichomoniasis. The company witnessed strong contributions from Biotheranostics and the respiratory menu on Panther Fusion during the quarter.In order to streamline its operations and reduce cost of revenues, Hologic has been adopting a few significant strategies over the past few years. The company has invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where management has recognized a good return. These include Hologic’s Genius marketing campaign in Breast Health, cervical cancer co-testing initiatives in Diagnostics, along with efforts to gain competitive market share with NovaSure. Per management, these strategic initiatives are already paying off through increased brand awareness, market share gains, and price stability, all of which will contribute to the company’s higher sales.On the flip side, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Hologic witnessed a year-over-year decline in both revenues and earnings were significantly down. The significant decline in COVID-19 assay revenues dragged total revenues down. It also reported a contraction in both margins, which looks discouraging.Story continuesThe company-provided adjusted gross margin contracted 890 basis points during the quarter. According to the company, the downside in gross margin was primarily due to a year-over-year decline in COVID-19 assay sales. The company’s adjusted operating margin contracted 1610 bps.We remain worried about the significant challenges Hologic faces owing to unfavorable foreign currency.

New Delhi continues to do business with Moscow and has increased its purchases of cheap Russian oil in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, much to the frustration of the West.India too has overcome its ""hesitations of history"" - as Modi put it in a 2016 address to U.S. Congress - and looked West amid its own military tensions and fraying ties with China.Though Modi has made several previous visits to the United States, this will be his first with the full diplomatic status of an official state visit, just the third of Biden's presidency and third by any Indian leader.""It’s a milestone in our relationship...It is a very significant visit, very important visit,"" India’s Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra told reporters on Monday.Story continuesA key achievement expected to be showcased is in the area of defence cooperation, especially between military industries of the two countries, Kwatra said, as India seeks to produce more weapons and equipment at home for itself and also for export.JET ENGINES, DRONES, SEMICONDUCTORSMajor announcements expected during Modi's visit are U.S. approval to General Electric to manufacture engines in India for its domestically produced fighter jets, India's purchase of 31 armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones made by General Atomics worth $3 billion, and removal of U.S. obstacles that prevent smoother trade in defence and high technology.""People will be looking back on this visit by Prime Minister Modi as a real springboard for the U.S.-India relationship, as it relates to defence ... issues in particular,"" Ely Ratner, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Affairs, said at a June 8 event.A stronger India that can defend its own interests and can contribute to regional security is good for the United States, he said, adding that there is an aspiration to see India as an exporter of security in the region.Cooperation in semiconductors, cyberspace, aerospace, strategic infrastructure and communication, commercial space projects, quantum computing and the use of artificial intelligence in industrial and defence fields, will also be discussed, a senior Indian official said.During the three-day visit that begins in New York on June 21, Modi will be hosted by President Biden for a state dinner and a private family dinner, attend lunch with Vice-President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and address a joint session of Congress for the second time in nine years.Modi will also meet American CEOs and lead an International Yoga Day event at the UN headquarters.""This is not a routine visit, this is a fundamental turning point between India and the U.S.,"" C. Raja Mohan, Senior Fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New Delhi.""This is not a question of containing China or anti-China. This is about producing a new balance of power in Asia, which is a multipolar Asia, where there is no single power dominating it,"" he said.

Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for GE here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying GE, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in GE?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for GE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.03.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for GE. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for GE.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

New Delhi continues to do business with Moscow and has increased its purchases of cheap Russian oil in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, much to the frustration of the West.India too has overcome its ""hesitations of history"" - as Modi put it in a 2016 address to U.S. Congress - and looked West amid its own military tensions and fraying ties with China.Though Modi has made several previous visits to the United States, this will be his first with the full diplomatic status of an official state visit, just the third of Biden's presidency and third by any Indian leader.""It’s a milestone in our relationship...It is a very significant visit, very important visit,"" India’s Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra told reporters on Monday.Story continuesA key achievement expected to be showcased is in the area of defence cooperation, especially between military industries of the two countries, Kwatra said, as India seeks to produce more weapons and equipment at home for itself and also for export.JET ENGINES, DRONES, SEMICONDUCTORSMajor announcements expected during Modi's visit are U.S. approval to General Electric to manufacture engines in India for its domestically produced fighter jets, India's purchase of 31 armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones made by General Atomics worth $3 billion, and removal of U.S. obstacles that prevent smoother trade in defence and high technology.""People will be looking back on this visit by Prime Minister Modi as a real springboard for the U.S.-India relationship, as it relates to defence ... issues in particular,"" Ely Ratner, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Affairs, said at a June 8 event.A stronger India that can defend its own interests and can contribute to regional security is good for the United States, he said, adding that there is an aspiration to see India as an exporter of security in the region.Cooperation in semiconductors, cyberspace, aerospace, strategic infrastructure and communication, commercial space projects, quantum computing and the use of artificial intelligence in industrial and defence fields, will also be discussed, a senior Indian official said.During the three-day visit that begins in New York on June 21, Modi will be hosted by President Biden for a state dinner and a private family dinner, attend lunch with Vice-President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and address a joint session of Congress for the second time in nine years.Modi will also meet American CEOs and lead an International Yoga Day event at the UN headquarters.""This is not a routine visit, this is a fundamental turning point between India and the U.S.,"" C. Raja Mohan, Senior Fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New Delhi.""This is not a question of containing China or anti-China. This is about producing a new balance of power in Asia, which is a multipolar Asia, where there is no single power dominating it,"" he said.

TORONTO, June 20, 2023 /CNW/ - A new survey by ADP Canada, conducted with Maru Public Opinion, shows that the gender pay gap in Canada may be slowly closing, but working Canadians who self-identify as women still report, on average, earning 21 per cent less than workers who self-identify as men, a 3 percentage points decrease from 20211.The survey collected self-reported gross salaries for 2022 from both part- and full-time employees and revealed the average salary reported by men was $72,743 versus $57,725 reported by women, representing a yearly deficit of over $15,000. Further, Canadian men bear higher compensation across salary levels with 33 per cent declaring earnings of over $80,000 in 2022, compared to only 18 per cent of women.______________________________1 Workplace Gender Gap Hits Home: ADP Canada Survey - Mar 8, 2021 Gender Pay Gap in Canada (CNW Group/ADP Canada Co.)From gender 'pay gap' to 'turnover'When respondents were asked about the impact of pay discrepancies, nearly half (47%) of Canadian workers cite they would consider leaving their current employer if they found out a colleague of equal standing, in terms of seniority and tenure, but different gender, received greater compensation than them. This sentiment was most apparent with women, as half indicated they would likely leave their employer in these circumstances, compared to 44 per cent of men Canadian workers.The survey also revealed contrasts across generations, as the next generation of workers may be even more impacted by a 'gender pay gap turnover.' Almost two-thirds (63%) of Gen Zs, followed by 53 per cent of Millennials pointed they would consider leaving their role in case of salary inequalities across genders, against only 37 per cent of Gen X and 32 per cent of Boomers.""While pay equity and equal access to higher paid jobs for all genders should remain an ongoing conversation within the Canadian workforce, these insights also point to the role that equal pay plays when it comes to employee retention strategies,"" says Heather Haslam, Vice President, Marketing at ADP Canada. ""Regular salary audits can help organizations close the gender pay gap internally and ensure more fair and equitable compensation. Additionally, reviewing recruitment practices and encouraging open communication between colleagues and managers to ensure all genders feel included and have the same chances of promotion can help with attracting and retaining top talent.""Story continuesCanadians trust their organization to act on inequalitiesWhile the pay gap persists, the good news is that nearly three quarters (71%) of working Canadians believe pay equity is a priority for their organization, including 72 per cent of women and 70 per cent of men.""The importance of building a culture of equality and transparency cannot be understated. As more Canadian workers are becoming inclined to reconsider their employment based on discrepancies in salaries, amongst other inequalities, prioritizing pay equity and embracing equal pay will give organizations an edge in hiring the best talent,"" concludes Haslam.Survey MethodologyThis Maru Public Opinion survey conducted on behalf of ADP Canada was undertaken by the sample and data collection experts at Maru/Blue. 1,556 randomly selected employed Canadian adults who are Maru Voice Canada online panelists were surveyed from March 6th to March 9th 2023. The results of this study have been weighted by education, age, gender and region (and in Quebec, language) to match the population, according to Census data.

(NASDAQ:ADP) have fallen more than 14% since the last time I looked at the stock at the end of last year. All the company has done in the ensuing period since has delivered two quarterly reports that easily topped analysts estimates.That said, shares have fallen almost 7%, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has had a double-digit rally year to date.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ADP. Click here to check it out. ADP 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ADPPeter Lynch Chart of ADPAutomatic Data Processing Is Now UndervaluedThe good news for investors watching the name is Automatic Data Processing is now trading at a much more reasonable valuation following the decline. Lets look at why I believe the stock could be offering a more attractive entry point for those interested in the name.Recent financial resultsAutomatic Data Processing reported third-quarter results on April 26. Revenue of $4.93 billion was up 9.2% from the prior year and $43 million better than projected. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.52 compared favorably to $2.21 in the same period a year ago and was 8 cents above estimates.Looking closer at each business segment, Employer Services had revenue growth of 11% to $3.34 billion. The segment margin expanded 80 basis points to 37.30%. This was driven by a 4% increase in pays per control.Revenue of $1.60 billion for PEO Services reflected a 5% increase year over year. The segment margin expanded 140 basis points to 16.40%. Average worksite employees paid improved 3% to nearly 710,000Automatic Data Processing also provided an updated outlook to the remainder of its fiscal year. Revenue growth is still expected to be 8% to 9%, but adjusted earnings per share are now forecasted to be up 16% to 17% for fiscal 2023, compared to 15% to 17% previously. This equates to around $8.17 for the fiscal year.Takeaways from earnings resultsAutomatic Data Processings most recent quarter continues a string of reports that has shown it has outperformed the markets expectations.Story continuesThe company also raised the low end of its earnings guidance for the fiscal year. The midpoint of revised guidance calls for 16.50% adjusted earnings per share growth for fiscal 2023. This is above the companys five- and 10-year compound annual growth rates of 11.50% and 10.70%, respectively, according to Value Line.Automatic Data Processing is projected to outperform both its long-term and medium-term growth rates. This is because the current environment remains conducive to the company. Unemployment remains very low at 3.70% as of the most current reading. As a result, many employers are struggling to find enough people to hire.The closer to full employment the economy is, the better Automatic Data Processing will likely perform as it can provide more benefits and payroll services to as large a pool of employees as possible. This was seen in the most recent quarter when pays under control and average worksite employees both grew by a low single-digit figure, showing the company's clients continue to grow their headcounts. It should be noted the most recent quarter saw a sequential decline in pays under control in the U.S., though just a modest drop from 5% in the second quarter.Even the Federal Reserve's aggressive action over the last year or so to fight inflation have been a benefit to the company. Higher interest rates have acted as a tailwind to Automatic Data Processings results. For example, the average yield on client funds was 2.5% in the third quarter, up from 1.2% in the prior year. The difference in yields is substantial in just one year and even more telling when average client funds totaled more than $39 billion in the period.Automatic Data Processing ranks very well on a variety of metrics according to GuruFocus, which results in the stock receiving a GF Score of 94 out of 100. Companies with higher GF Scores tend to outperform those with lower rankings, according to research by GuruFocus.Automatic Data Processing Is Now UndervaluedAutomatic Data Processing has a perfect 10 out of 10 on growth from GuruFocus, primarily powered by industry-beating revenue increases over the last three years. The company scores a 9 out of 10 for profitability, where Automatic Data Processing easily beats most peers on nearly every metric, including operating margin, net margin and return on equity. Most scores are also near the high end of the range for the last decade. Automatic Data Processing has middle of the road scores in the areas of financial strength, momentum and value.Valuation analysisFollowing the mid-single-digit decline year to date, Automatic Data Processing is trading with a price-earnings ratio of 27.10 off expected earnings per share of $8.17 for the fiscal year. While elevated, the multiple is now below the stocks five- and 10-year average price-earnings ratios of 29.2 and 27.5.The stock is now trading below its GF Value Line as well.Automatic Data Processing Is Now UndervaluedAutomatic Data Processing currently trades hands at $221.32. With a GF Value of $250.78, the stock has a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.88. Reaching the GF Value would reward shareholders with a 13.30% return. This is before factoring in the dividend aristocrats market-beating yield of 2.30%.Final thoughtsAutomatic Data Processing has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index so far in 2023, but the companys business performance remains very strong. The most recent quarter showed growth in almost every area and the company also boosted the low end of its earnings guidance.When I discussed the stock in December of last year, shares were trading above their medium- and long-term average price-earnings ratio as well as their GF Value. Now, Automatic Data Processing is trading below all of these metrics.For investors who were waiting for a better price point, Automatic Data Processing now appears more reasonably valued, which could make the stock an enticing option.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Organic sales are likely to increase 6% in fiscal 2023 versus 4-5% growth mentioned earlier.Procter &amp; Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. PG’s continued investment in its businesses — alongside efforts to offset macro cost headwinds, and balance top and bottom-line growth — underscores its productivity efforts. The company is witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of the business.In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company’s gross margin was aided by 210 bps of gross productivity savings, while the operating margin included productivity savings of 290 bps. SG&amp;A expenses in the quarter reflected productivity savings of 80 bps.Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble retained its earnings outlook for fiscal 2023, which continues to reflect supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation, which have been impacting consumer confidence.The company expects EPS on a reported basis to be flat to up 4% from the $5.81 recorded in fiscal 2022. It anticipates EPS at the low end of the range due to the impacts of ongoing commodity and material cost headwinds, and currency impacts.Story continuesConclusionSolid demand, brand strength and productivity efforts bode well and will likely help PG stay afloat despite cost headwinds and rising inflation. Also, a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.1% raises optimism about the stock.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space are Clorox CLX, Coty Inc.

165,17b6dd74-0e4e-3ce8-b6bc-f1e386b85ebb,PG,2023-06-20,Here's Why Brown-Forman (BF.B) is Marching Ahead of Its Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-brown-forman-bf-140200543.html,1687183320,STORY,"['BF-B', 'PG']","[Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B) has been gaining from the premiumization of its portfolio and aggressive brand investments. Continued strength in its brands, mainly the Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, bodes well.This led to a solid year-over-year performance in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. Earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents advanced 36% year over year. Net sales of $1,046 million increased 5% year over year on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 4.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research That said, let’s delve deeper into the factors that make BF.B a promising stock.A Brief IntrospectionBrown-Forman’s underlying sales for fiscal 2023 were aided by the company’s portfolio strength and growth across all geographic regions. The company’s overall sales in the United States advanced 3% on a reported and organic basis. The rise was driven by volume gains for Woodford Reserve, owing to the rise in distributor inventories, and higher pricing across the Jack Daniel’s portfolio, as well as the launch of the Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola Ready-to-Drink (RTD).The developed international market reported sales growth of 4%, with organic sales rising 10%. The improvement can be attributed to volume gains for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel’s RTDs. Additionally, higher pricing for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey has aided the results.The emerging markets registered 18% net sales growth, whereas organic sales improved 24%, backed by the growth of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey in the United Arab Emirates and Brazil, as well as continued double-digit growth of New Mix in Mexico. Net sales in the Travel Retail channel advanced 41% on a reported basis and 43% on an organic basis due to higher volumes for the majority of the portfolio, as travel trends continued to rebound.In fiscal 2023, net sales for Jack Daniel’s family of brands were up 4% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic basis. The brand’s sales were driven by solid demand, higher pricing and the estimated increase in distributor inventories. Strength in Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey in the international markets and the Travel Retail channel acted as major growth drivers.Notably, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey reported sales growth of 3% and organic growth of 8%. Sales benefited from strong consumer demand and higher pricing. The continued consumer interest in flavor and convenience boosted the performance of Jack Daniel’s RTD, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire.Premium bourbon brands reported sales growth of 23% and organic sales growth of 24% in fiscal 2023, driven by double-digit growth in Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. An estimated rise in distributor inventories, along with higher volumes and pricing, boosted sales for Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. Jack Daniel’s RTDs/Ready-to-Pours benefited from the introduction of the Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola RTD, as well as the launch of Jack Daniel’s Bonded Tennessee Whiskey, resulting in year-over-year sales growth of 11% and 16% on an organic basis. New Mix reported sales growth of 53% and organic sales growth of 45%, driven by market share gains in Mexico, as well as higher volumes and prices.Brown-Forman’s tequila portfolio witnessed year-over-year sales growth of 10% each on a reported basis and an organic basis. This was driven by double-digit sales growth for the el Jimador and Herradura brands. Sales increased 11% on a reported and 10% on an organic basis for the Herradura brand, driven by higher prices and volumes in Mexico, and volume growth in the United States partly due to an estimated increase in distributor inventories. el Jimador reported year-over-year sales growth of 13% on a reported basis and 14% on an organic basis, driven by growth across all geographic regions, particularly in emerging markets and the United States.It has also been on track with its long-term pricing strategy, which aims to increase prices year over year to grow sales as part of its revenue growth management initiatives. Consequently, management issued an upbeat fiscal 2024 view. It anticipates organic sales growth of 5-7% for fiscal 2024. The company is optimistic about organic sales and organic operating income growth.BF.B anticipates trends to normalize after two consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. Based on the aforementioned assumptions, Brown-Forman expects the organic operating income to increase 6-8% year over year, driven by lower supply-chain disruption costs, partly offset by continued input cost pressures.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeBrown-Forman has witnessed several hurdles in fiscal 2023, including supply-chain challenges, higher input costs due to inflation, significant impacts of negative foreign exchange and the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In fiscal 2024, inflation is likely to continue to negatively impact input costs.Despite cost management initiatives, Brown-Forman has been witnessing higher advertising expenses due to continued investments in its brands. Advertising expenses increased 5% year over year to $134 million for the fiscal fourth quarter. On an organic basis, advertising expenses advanced 3%. The increase was driven by elevated marketing spending in the United States to back growth of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, Herradura, Woodford Reserve and the launch of the Jack Daniel’s Bonded series.SG&amp;A expenses of $201 million rose 4% year over year and 3% on an organic basis mainly on higher compensation-related expenses, rising discretionary spending and the acquisition, and integration costs for the Gin Mare and Diplomatico brands.ConclusionAll said, we believe that strength in Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, portfolio premiumization and pricing strategy are likely to offset inflation and cost woes.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Conagra Brands CAG, Celsius Holdings CELH and Procter &amp; Gamble PG.Conagra Brands, operating as a consumer-packaged goods food company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). CAG has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.2%, on average. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.4%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Conagra Brands’ current fiscal-year sales and earnings suggests improvements of 7.1% and 16.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. SL Green (SLG) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.35 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 19, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.35 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.33 Zacks Consensus Estimate, SL Green has an Earnings ESP of 1.61%.SLG is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Postal Realty Trust (PSTL).Postal Realty Trust is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 1, 2023. PSTL's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.25 a share 43 days from its next earnings release.For Postal Realty Trust, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.25 is 2.04%.SLG and PSTL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

168,dcfb4028-0895-3989-adfb-f3520dded434,VNO,2023-06-20,3 Office REITs to Sell Before the Commercial Property Crash,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-office-reits-sell-commercial-105501872.html,1686740101,STORY,"['VNO', 'BAM', 'HPP', 'BXP']","[In early June, I read an article about Shark Tank star Barbara Corcoran’s thoughts about the current state of affairs for office space.“No one really believes it’s going to turn the corner,” Fortune reported Corcoran’s comments. “People are staying home. Our best office buildings in midtown Manhattan are 50% occupied, and in most major cities or in secondary cities, we have a 20% vacancy rate. No one wants to take that chance.”Corcoran believes it’s going to get worse before it gets better. A big part of why it will worsen is with defaults rising on real estate loans. That makes all but the best office-focused real estate investment trusts (REITs) off-limits. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEven excellent companies such as, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM), need help with some of their office holdings. In Brookfield’s case, its Los Angeles office portfolio is starting to implode slightly. However, investing in BAM gives you a diversified portfolio of alternative assets. With pure-play office REITs, you don’t. For this reason, I’d look at these three office REITs to sell.Hudson Pacific Properties (HPP)Stocks to sellSource: chanpipat / Shutterstock.comHudson Pacific Properties (NYSE:HPP) recently cut its dividend by 50% to 12.5 cents a share. The Los Angeles-based company isn’t a pure-play office REIT. It also owns 90 sound stages in six global media markets. It recently acquired Quixote Studios for $360 million. Quixote owns 23 sound stages and a fleet of film production trucks and cast trailers. It’s hard to know if that’s a good or bad thing. After all, Hollywood is in the middle of a protracted writer’s strike. That can’t be good for sound stage rentals. So, while the long-term prognosis for film production is good, Hudson Pacific currently has two hot potatoes. The REIT’s office portfolio is primarily in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Seattle. As Wolf Street mentioned on June 9, the office vacancy rates in those four markets are between 23% and 33%. Story continuesThe company had nothing but red ink since 2020. In the trailing 12 months ended March 31, HPP lost $57 million on $1.03 billion in revenue. Their stock is down 70% over the past year and 86% over the past five years. This is a falling knife you don’t want to catch. Stay away. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockIt’s been quite a few years since Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) was involved with Toys ‘R’ Us. VNO bought the toy retailer as part of an investment group in 2005, and by 2018, it was liquidated while in bankruptcy proceedings. Vornado is the fourth largest office REIT by market cap. The company suspended its dividend for 2023. However, assuming business gets better, Vornado will restart their dividend in 2024. That’s a big if, according to Corcoran. The second-largest office landlord in New York City, it’s selling off some properties in the Big Apple to generate cash. However, as Wolf Street points out, New York Office towers are selling for much lower valuations than they did back in 2016. No dividend, no seller’s market, and a New York office market in the toilet suggests you might want to wait until the work-from-home trend completely dies down. So far, it’s not looking good.  Further, even Mad Money host Jim Cramer doesn’t recommend Vornado.“The management there is so strong, but the tug of war against New York is so bad I’m not going to recommend Vornado,” Cramer commented on May 25.  Boston Properties (BXP)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockIn January, I included Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) in a group of seven REITs that will be big winners in 2023. Boy, I was definitely wrong about that. But, seriously, BXP is down more than 18% year-to-date, 40% over the past year, and 55% over the past five. Swing and a miss. Not even close. I reasoned that BXP shares were cheaper from a valuation perspective then at any time in the past decade. You can’t blame a guy for looking for a good deal every now and again. However, what I also said explains why its share price is stuck in neutral.“Wisely, it concentrates its properties in six markets: Boston (34.7% of total premier space in the central business district), Washington D.C. (19.9%), San Francisco (39%), Seattle (25.1%), and Manhattan (9.6%),” I wrote on Jan. 25. Unfortunately, office buildings aren’t getting enough leases signed, whether Class A or Class C. That’s not good news if you’re a shareholder. As Corcoran said, it’s likely to get worse before it gets better for the likes of Vornado.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

169,ade9105f-3296-3d68-9fcf-927c38f371a5,MAC,2023-06-20,"Macerich (MAC) Takes Full-Ownership of 5 Sears Boxes, Stock Up",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macerich-mac-takes-full-ownership-130500192.html,1687179900,STORY,['MAC'],"[In May 2023, The Macerich Company MAC announced that it completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in five former Sears boxes from its joint venture partner — Seritage Growth Properties. MAC now wholly owns and controls each of these parcels.Reflecting positive sentiments, shares of MAC gained nearly 1% on Jun 16 regular trading session on the NYSE.This latest development is expected to boost sales and traffic at its high-performing regional centers, making it a strategic fit. It also provides it the flexibility to undertake redevelopment opportunities at these properties and enrich them with premium in-demand retailers.The five Sears boxes, encompassing a total gross leasable area of 819,000 square feet, are located in Macerich’s regional town centers — Danbury Fair (CT), Los Cerritos Center (CA), Washington Square (OR), Chandler Fashion Center (AZ) and Freehold Raceway Mall (NJ).The former Sears space at MAC’s Danbury Fair will house in-demand retailers, Target TGT and Primark, which have already leased out the area. The Target store is currently under construction and slated for a spring 2024 opening while the Primark store is functional. The combined sales volume from these stores is likely to exhibit a significant improvement over the prior Sears’ sales volume.In addition, focusing on the re-use and mixed-use of its properties through the recapture and repositioning of anchor tenants, the company’s Los Cerritos Center and Washington Square centers are either in the process or are fully entitled to undergo redevelopments. This will allow Macerich to bring a diverse range of offerings to its properties, including fitness, residential, hotel, office and medical uses.Further, Macerich intends to replace the former Sears site at Chandler Fashion Center and Freehold Raceway Mall with several high-traffic-generating retail/entertainment/restaurant uses that are well-suited for each of the communities there. Particularly, Primark is already operating in part of the former Sears space at its Freehold Raceway Mall center.Per Dave Short, executive vice president, asset management, Macerich, “Building on the prior leasing and activation of several of these boxes, this transaction allows us to continue to pursue redevelopment of these properties in any number of ways – from adding mixed-use and greater density, which is a hallmark of Macerich’s Regional Town Center strategy, to bringing in highly productive retail performers.”With mixed-used assets gaining traction in recent years, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) has been making concerted efforts to ring in premium brands at its properties to drive more footfall and boost sales.This May, Macerich and Wish You Were Here Group, a renowned, multi-concept hospitality company, announced that the south wing of Scottsdale Fashion Square will house the upscale, experiential restaurant concept — Élephante.The move will mark Élephante’s first location outside Los Angeles. It will encompass 12,000 square feet of Macerich’s top-performing shopping center, aiming to provide a multidimensional experience to the Scottsdale community.Further, in January 2023, MAC announced that its Santa Monica Place will house the first U.S. flagship location for global art and technology phenomenon ARTE MUSEUM, replacing the former ArcLight Cinemas site.Also, amid renewed enthusiasm in consumers’ preference for an in-person shopping experience following the pandemic downtime, this retail REIT’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States has witnessed healthy leasing activity.Earlier this year, it welcomed Chinese restaurant Din Tai Fung to Santa Monica Place, and fashion retailer, Zara, and Irish retail brand, Primark, to Queens Center in New York City.Nonetheless, growing e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment pose concerns for the company.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 20% in the past three months compared with its industry's growth of 6.9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Kite Realty Group Trust KRG and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. United Airlines (UAL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.04 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 19, 2023.United Airlines' Earnings ESP sits at 7.3%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.04 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.77.UAL is part of a big group of Transportation stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at American Airlines (AAL) as well.American Airlines, which is readying to report earnings on July 20, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.54 a share, and AAL is 31 days out from its next earnings report.American Airlines' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 6.14% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46.Story continuesUAL and AAL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

In the first project, the company invested $3.5 million in its Blue Grass water system, which includes the construction of a new elevated water storage tank and the installation of almost two miles of a new 12-inch water transmission main. Per the second project, the company invested $0.5 million and refurbished two elevated storage tanks with a combined capacity of one million gallons.Iowa American Water has been investing steadily in infrastructure improvements, such as replacing aging water pipes, upgrading water treatment facilities and refurbishing water storage tanks. Such maintenance investments at regular intervals allow the company to further improve the quality of its services and serve customers efficiently.Investments Essential for Water IndustryAging water and wastewater infrastructure is a major headwind for the water industry. It is evident from the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) that due to the delay in pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. Delays in the repair and maintenance of the infrastructure could increase the problem further.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructure like storage tanks and purifying units, as well as miles of water mains, needs maintenance at proper intervals.American Water Works is making regular investments to maintain its infrastructure. It aims to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 period and $30-$34 billion for 10 years from 2023-2032. Last week, Pennsylvania American Water decided to invest $17.5 million in 2023 to upgrade and maintain eight of its water storage tanks and construct five new tanks to cater to the rising demand for water.Story continuesUtilities Making InvestmentWater utilities like Essential Utilities WTRG, California Water Service Group CWT and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructure.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion through 2025 to improve the water and natural gas systems and better serve customers using improved information technology.  California Water Service plans to invest more than $725 million in capital expenditures through 2024.Middlesex Water plans to invest $266 million during 2023-2025 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure and provide services to customers in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.The above investments might appear to be very small compared with the total requirements needed for repair and upgrades but are undeniably a positive move to address the aging water and wastewater infrastructure.Price PerformanceShares of AWK have rallied 3.8% in the past month compared with the industry’s 2.8% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankAmerican Water Works currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

SG&amp;A expenses in the quarter reflected productivity savings of 80 bps.Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble retained its earnings outlook for fiscal 2023, which continues to reflect supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation, which have been impacting consumer confidence.The company expects EPS on a reported basis to be flat to up 4% from the $5.81 recorded in fiscal 2022. It anticipates EPS at the low end of the range due to the impacts of ongoing commodity and material cost headwinds, and currency impacts.Story continuesConclusionSolid demand, brand strength and productivity efforts bode well and will likely help PG stay afloat despite cost headwinds and rising inflation.

Yet, high debt levels are headwinds.Factors Favoring UNPWe are bullish on Union Pacific’s ability to generate cash. Cash from operations in 2021 was $9 billion, up 6% year over year. Free cash flow increased 8.8% to $3,523 million.Increasing free cash flow supports UNP’s shareholder-friendly activities. In 2021, the company returned $10.1 billion to its shareholders through dividends ($2.8 billion) and buybacks ($7.3 billion).  It hiked dividend twice in 2021.In May 2022, UNP upped its quarterly dividend by a further 10% to $1.30 per share. UNP returned $9.44 billion to its shareholders through dividends ($3.1 billion) and share repurchases ($6.3 billion).In first-quarter 2023, Union Pacific returned $1.4 billion to its shareholders through dividends ($795 million) and share repurchases ($575 million). Management anticipates a dividend payout of approximately 45% (of earnings) in 2023.With economic activities gaining pace, freight revenues, which account for bulk of the company's top line, are improving. Freight revenues improved 14% year over year in 2022. Segment wise, freight revenues increased 13%, 12% and 18% in the bulk, industrial and premium units, respectively. Freight revenues increased 4% in first-quarter 2023.Key RisksWe are concerned about Union Pacific's high debt levels. Debt/EBITDA ratio (adjusted) at Union Pacific deteriorated to 2.3 in 2018 from 1.9 in 2017. It increased to 2.5 at the end of 2019.The measure increased further to 2.9 at 2020 end. The reading was 2.7 at the end of 2021. It raised to 2.9 at 2022 end.The metric was 2.9 at the end of first-quarter 2023 as well. A high debt/EBITDA ratio often indicates that a firm may be unable to service its debt appropriately.Zacks Rank UNP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA and Triton International Limited TRTN.Story continuesCopa Holdings, which presently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is aided by improved air-travel demand.

This testing provides actionable clinical recommendations and medication management plans specific to and customized for each patient.This voluntary no-cost DNA testing program analyzes an individual's DNA via an at-home saliva collection kit that is tested by Quest. Test results are analyzed to assess whether the patient's current medications are most effective for that individual. Employees receive a thorough report, outlining the results and providing recommendations that they can discuss with their doctors. The results can improve medication effectiveness and safety, reduce adverse effects, and help find the right medication and dosage.An employee's storySara Brown, Director, Commercial Operations, Employer Population Health, found that she was experiencing increasing flare-ups while taking several prescriptions for her rheumatoid arthritis. She sent in a sample of her DNA to have it analyzed and then worked with her physician and pharmacist to adjust her medication plan based on the results of the pharmacogenomic testing results.COVID-19 testing for Quest employeesQuest offered COVID-19 serology testing to all employees as a no-cost, voluntary option.We offered both spike protein and nucleocapsid antibody testing (ie, testing to detect antibodies to specific virus spike proteins and to the nucleocapsid protein of the COVID-19 virus) as part of this innovative program as we were learning more about the virus and best practices for mitigating infection and transmission. Approximately 80% of Quest Blueprint for Wellness participants opted in for testing.Story continuesSerology tests detect antibodies made when an individual has been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 or vaccinated. Serology testing indicates whether an individual has previously been infected, but does not determine whether one is actively infected with or has recovered from the virus.Serology testing is appropriate for individuals who are asymptomatic to determine whether they have been infected. Those who elect to participate should continue to adhere to safety guidelines, regardless of result.COVID-19 antibody testing is free for all Quest employees through our special Employee Testing Program. This is regardless of whether employees are on the Quest medical plan.Read more.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Quest Diagnostics on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Quest Diagnostics Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/quest-diagnostics Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Quest DiagnosticsView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/762088/New-Tests-Yield-Actionable-Insights]"

While Canada performed strongly on a global level, ranking 17th out of 146 countries, the Cisco Canada Digital Readiness Index revealed that there are significant discrepancies across provinces and territories.The study focuses specifically on the performance of each of Canada’s provinces and territories, measuring data across seven components: Basic Needs, Human Capital, Business and Government Investment, Ease of Doing Business, Start-up Environment, Technology Adoption and Technology Infrastructure.“The Digital Readiness Index looks beyond technology to help us understand Canada’s performance and get a holistic measure of our progress towards a digitally capable, equitable and inclusive society,” said Shannon Leininger, President, Cisco Canada. “Globally, Canada has a strong and consistent year-over-year performance, meaning that we are continuing to invest in areas that will help us advance and remain competitive. Together, the public and private sector should continue to work together to make digital readiness a priority and maximize the economic and social benefits for all Canadians.”Story continuesImproving Digital Readiness for all Canadians Must Be Top PriorityTo maintain and secure Canada’s digital leadership and build a more digitally equitable and inclusive society, the Digital Readiness Index provides guidance on how Canada can improve overall readiness through continued investment in three key areas:Improve connectivity to close opportunity gaps and ensure digital equity and inclusion.Maximize Canada’s human capital advantage by investing in digital skills to build the most highly trained labour force.Close the cybersecurity readiness gap and improve Canada’s security resilience.“Digital readiness is not static. Canada’s path to digitization will require ongoing investment and focus to ensure the benefits of digital readiness are felt equally by all, especially those in Indigenous, rural and remote communities,” said Leininger. “If we do not address our domestic gaps, regions in Canada that perform at the lowest levels of digital readiness will fall further behind, decreasing Canada’s digital leadership position.”Digital Readiness Scores by Province and TerritoryWhile Canada’s global digital readiness score is strong, the provincial and territorial results indicate that progress varies across the country and not all Canadians have equal access to digital opportunities.British Columbia received the highest digital readiness score in Canada driven by its first-place ranking on Ease of Doing Business, Start-Up Environment and Technology Adoption. Quebec (2nd) and Ontario (3rd) followed closely behind with top scores in Business and Government Investment (1st and 2nd respectively), and strong scores in Technology Adoption and Technology Infrastructure.Alberta (4th), Prince Edward Island (5th) and Yukon (6th) all scored in the top five on Basic Needs and Ease of Doing Business. These regions also ranked in the top three for Human Capital due to strong labour force participation and a high youth population (AB and YK) and net migration (P.E.I. and YK).Nova Scotia (7th), Manitoba (8th) and New Brunswick (9th) fell just below the national average. NS and MB performed well in Ease of Doing Business due to low internal trade barriers, while NB ranked in the top five on Basic Needs due to positive housing affordability.Northwest Territories (10th), Saskatchewan (11th) and Newfoundland and Labrador (12th) fell below the average digital readiness score. Business and Government Investment and Human Capital scores were close to average for N.W.T. and SK, while NFLD had above average scores in Basic Needs, Business and Government Investment and Start-up Environment.Nunavut ranked the lowest in Canada, reinforcing the need for all levels of government to address Basic Needs of the population and build a solid and long-term foundation for digital readiness.To view the full Canada report and/or individual provincial and territorial reports, visit the Cisco Canada Digital Readiness Index webpage.MethodologyThe Digital Readiness Index is a holistic model that looks at a total of 25 metrics across the seven components of digital readiness. Metric data are from reputable sources including Statistics Canada, CRTC, CMHC and more. The model uses a “z-score” methodology, measuring how many standard deviations above or below the mean of a particular metric/score. If a score is below the mean, it is expressed as a negative number, and if above the mean, it will be a positive number.###About CiscoCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.
