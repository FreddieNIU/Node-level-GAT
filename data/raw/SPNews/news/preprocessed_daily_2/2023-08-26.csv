1,2b10bd6e-80ff-3b18-a4ce-b639f27f0df0,NUE,2023-08-26,3 Basic Materials Stocks to Buy for Sound Growth & Value,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-basic-materials-stocks-buy-232400726.html,1693005840,STORY,"['PPG', 'NUE']","[The defensive hedge many basic materials stocks provided amid high inflation has become more and more of a distant memory.Higher commodity prices led to immense profitability with Nucor NUE as an example thriving as a leading steel producer. Naturally, investors have to monitor the premium they are paying for Nucor’s stock among others as the high-inflationary boost starts to settle.    However, there are still some intruing options among the basic materials sector as it relates to growth and value. Here are three top-rated stocks that stand out in particular. Hawkins HWKNWith an essential niche as a chemical products provider, Hawkins stock is very attractive right now and covets a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).As a brief overview, thousands of water treatment facilities, manufacturers, food and dairy producers, and research labs among other organizations depend on Hawkins for chemical products.Considering its broad reach to a variety of end markets, Hawkins stock certainly holds a lot of value to investors. Earnings are expected to pop 19% in Hawkins’ current fiscal 2024 to $3.40 per share compared to $2.86 a share in FY23. Even better, this would represent 155% EPS growth over the last five years with 2020 earnings at $1.33 a share.Hawkins stock has soared 52% this year to outperform the broader indexes and the Zacks Chemical-Specialty Markets +20%. With that being said, Hawkins's stock still trades reasonably at 16.9X forward earnings which is near its industry average of 14.8X and nicely beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 20.4X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG Industries PPGNext up, PPG Industries stock remains attractive and lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). While PPG stock is up a modest but respectable +10% this year there should be more room to run.Earnings estimates remain higher, and the chemical coats, paints, and glass provider is expecting expansive bottom-line growth. PPG’s earnings are now forecasted to climb 24% in FY23 to $7.51 per share compared to EPS of $6.05 last year. Notably, FY24 earnings are expected to jump another 10%.Story continuesAt 18.2X forward earnings, investors aren’t paying a stretched premium for PPG’s attractive growth. PPG trades modestly above the Chemical-Specialty Industry average of 14.8X but below the benchmark. Taking a closer look, PPG’s price-to-earnings valuation combined with the company’s growth rate is very compelling for investors.This is indicated in the company’s PEG ratio which is near the optimum level of less than 1. With a PEG of 1.03, PPG’s stock looks like a very sound investment for value and growth as this is below the industry average of 1.88 and the benchmark's 1.71. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLivent LTHMRounding out the list, now may be a good time to buy Livent’s stock which also sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Livent is a producer of lithium chemicals for the application in batteries which will be essential to the continued expansion of electric vehicles.Livent’s lithium chemicals are also used for agrochemicals, aerospace, alloys, pharmaceuticals, and various industrial applications. Livent stock is up +8% YTD but is still near its 52-week lows at around $21 a share.With much of the risk-to-reward appearing to be priced in, it’s noteworthy that Livent’s FY23 earnings are projected to soar 53% to $2.15 per share. More intriguing, FY24 earnings are forecasted to climb another 20% to $2.57 per share.This will be accompanied by double-digit top-line growth as well. Total sales are expected to soar 33% this year and leap another 28% in FY24 to $1.39 billion. Livent appears to be vastly undervalued considering the company’s growth potential. To that point, Livent stock trades at 10.2X forward earnings which is a nice discount to the Chemical-Specialty Industry average and the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line These basic materials stocks make a strong case for being undervalued considering their importance to a variety of end markets. They appear to offer good value to investors at their current levels making now a good time to buy with Hawkins, PPG Industries, and Livent expecting stellar growth and shaping up to be viable investments for 2023 and beyond.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that report, analysts expect Nucor to post earnings of $4.77 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 26.62%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $9.14 billion, down 12.94% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $18.76 per share and revenue of $35.8 billion.

The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.93 per share, indicating a 3.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 3.4% higher revenues of $12.78 billion.The expected long-term earnings growth rate is 7.3%, which is higher than the industry average of 6.4%.Northbound Estimate RevisionEstimates for 2023 and 2024 have moved up nearly 2.3% and 1.2%, respectively, in the past 30 days, reflecting investors’ optimism.Earnings Surprise HistoryUnum Group has a decent earnings surprise history. It beat estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed in one, the average beat being 7.33%.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceUNM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past year, the stock has gained 25.5%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 15.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStyle ScoreUNM has a favorable VGM Score of A. VGM Score helps to identify stocks with the most attractive value, best growth and most promising momentum.Business TailwindsSolid operational performance, favorable benefits experience as well as solid top-line improvement in the core businesses should continue to fuel growth and help UNM achieve its targeted growth. Management remains focused on moving on to a mix of businesses with higher growth and stable margins. This should help Unum Group’s premium from core business to increase 4-6% over the long term.Unum U.S. continues to benefit from disciplined sales trends, strong persistency in group lines and the growth of new product lines like dental and vision, which improve premium income.Riding on improving premium income and favorable risk results, operating income in the Colonial Life segment is expected to improve. In 2023, UNM expects positive adjusted operating income growth with sales improvement.Sales in the Colonial Life segment are likely to gain from healthy agent recruiting and productive small-case sales. Colonial Life expects sales growth in the range of 8-12%, premium growth in the band of 1-3% and adjusted operating return on equity in the range of 20-22% in 2023.The insurer boasts a solid capital position.

The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for the company's traditional U.S. insurance companies was 450% as of Jun 30, 2023, and the holding companies had available holding company liquidity of $1,072 million. Over the long term, UNM expects a risk-based capital ratio of more than 350% and by the end of 2023, the ratio is expected to be 400%.Unum Group has consistently enhanced shareholders’ value through dividend hikes and share buybacks. The dividend yield of the company was 2.9%, higher than the industry average of 2.3%, making it an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors. Currently, the remaining repurchase amount under the current share repurchase program was $150 million. UNM expects to increase the run rate of share repurchase by 50% in the upcoming quarter and pay a 10% higher dividend.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Arch Capital Group Ltd.

The consensus mark for quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.2 billion, indicating growth of 2.5% from the prior-year reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.75 per share, suggesting a decline of 15.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 10.9%. Its bottom line surpassed estimates by 20.4%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.PVH Corp. Price and EPS Surprise PVH Corp. Price and EPS SurprisePVH Corp. price-eps-surprise | PVH Corp. QuoteFactors to NotePVH Corp has been gaining from the continued momentum in its core brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, along with pricing actions and strong consumer engagement. The company's Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands are anticipated to have performed well in the quarter under review, driven by robust consumer demand.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management was confident about the underlying power of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, which position the company’s business to succeed in the ever-changing consumer landscape.Our model predicts the Tommy Hilfiger brand to register sales growth of 5% in the fiscal second quarter. Sales for Calvin Klein are anticipated to be almost flat year over year, while Heritage Brands is expected to deliver a sales decline of 4.6%.Also, the continued momentum in PVH Corp's international unit is likely to have aided the company’s performance in the fiscal second quarter. Management has been on track with its PVH+ Plan, which is likely to result in substantial cost efficiencies and better productivity. PVH expected the business momentum to be positive throughout 2023. These factors are likely to get reflected in the company’s top-line performance in the fiscal second quarter.PVH is focused on fueling digital growth by developing a holistic distribution strategy for Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, driven by digital and direct-to-consumer channels, and wholesale partnerships. It looks to develop a demand and data-driven operating model with a systematic and repeatable product creation model. PVH also focuses on boosting efficiencies to be cost-competitive and, in turn, reinvest in strategic plans. Gains from these efforts are likely to get reflected in the company’s top and bottom lines in the to-be-reported quarter.However, inflation-led high costs remain near-term headwinds for PVH Corp. High raw material costs and currency headwinds have been taking a toll on the company’s margins. The gross margin for the fiscal second quarter is expected to reflect higher product costs, the negative impacts of foreign exchange and abnormally high raw material costs.Additionally, the company has been witnessing an elevated SG&amp;A expense rate from increased investment-related costs for the DTC and international businesses for the past few quarters. This is likely to have dented the operating margin in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported earnings call, management anticipated a soft second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance due to global inflationary pressures. It expects revenue growth in the low-single digits on both reported and constant-currency basis. The bottom line is likely to be $1.70, whereas it reported $1.72 in the year-ago quarter on a GAAP basis and $2.08 on an adjusted basis.We expect SG&amp;A expenses to increase 8.6% year over year to $1,107.9 million in the fiscal second quarter. Meanwhile, SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, are expected to increase 290 basis points (bps). Our model predicts an adjusted operating margin of 8%, suggesting a 190-bps contraction from the year-ago quarter’s actual. In dollar terms, adjusted operating income is likely to decline 17.3% year over year.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PVH Corp this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

The latest development came on the heels of receiving the IVDR (EU Quality Management System Certificate) certification. The EXENT Solution is intended to aid the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies and the monitoring of multiple myeloma and Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia patients.The automated mass spectrometry system is an innovative breakthrough for the detection and monitoring of monoclonal immunoglobulins. Presently, the solution is commercially available in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.About EXTENT SolutionThe EXENT Solution was developed with the Mayo Clinic intellectual property, combining industry leadership in innovation with Mayo’s expertise in monoclonal gammopathy research. The solution enables clinical laboratories to measure, quantify and track specific endogenous M-proteins and exogenous therapeutic monoclonal antibodies with enhanced analytical sensitivity and specificity in serum.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt features three integrated modules — EXENT-iP500, an automated sample preparation instrument; EXENT-iX500, a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (MALDI-ToF MS) and EXENT-iQ, the intelligent and intuitive workflow software that includes data review. The analyzer is combined with the EXENT Immunoglobulin Isotypes immunoassay — a highly sensitive and specific immunoassay for measuring and quantifying IgG, IgA and IgM.News in DetailThe treatment for monoclonal gammopathies is often determined by monitoring M-protein levels, which can indicate the tumor size.  However, many patients are achieving M-protein concentrations below detectable limits using standard techniques due to remarkable treatment successes in recent years. However, differences in disease progression still exist within this group.The EXENT Solution addresses this unmet clinical need for more sensitive analytical methods that can differentiate between subsets without initiating invasive bone marrow biopsy techniques too early.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Vice Chair &amp; CFO, Terrance Dolan, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$39.75 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$36.13. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$2.4m for 76.70k shares. But they sold 85.82k shares for US$3.6m. All up, insiders sold more shares in U.S. Bancorp than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.U.S. Bancorp Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at U.S. Bancorp. In total, insiders dumped US$1.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$110m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought U.S. Bancorp stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - U.S. Bancorp has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Of course U.S. Bancorp may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

The seven-week program taught Kim how to use multiple computer languages, including Java, HTML/CSS, Python and C++. It also helped Kim develop a passion for coding and technology.Kim, a rising senior at the University of Georgia majoring in computer science, along with Tamara Kunter, a rising senior at Georgia Tech majoring in computer science with a minor in Middle Eastern and North African studies, and Israa Mohammed, a rising junior at the University of Minnesota majoring in computer science, are all among more than 220 interns spending the summer at U.S. Bank.""It was such a great experience at GWC. I got to build connections, create projects and receive guidance from amazing mentors,"" Kim said. ""After the program ended, we were all part of the alumni network, and that's how I found out about the internship with U.S. Bank. Seeing that U.S. Bank was a Girls Who Code partner really incentivized me to apply because I've had great experiences with both their immersion and mentorship programs.""U.S. Bank is entering its sixth year supporting GWC and over time has invested more than $1 million in the programs for students and alumni.According to GWC, the organization has served 580,000 young women and non-binary students over its 10-year history. In 2022, GWC supported more than 71,000 K-12 students and connected more than 2,400 GWC students with internships and job opportunities in tech through its virtual hiring summits.Story continues""In the 2022/23 program year, our U.S. Bank team shifted our focus slightly to provide career readiness training and opportunities,"" said Jason Teal, program manager for Tech Services at U.S. Bank.""We sponsored GWC's Hiring Summit, Technical Interview Prep program and overall Pipeline programming, which supports female and nonbinary students at all points from third grade through college, and beyond,"" Teal said. ""Through our support in these programs, we participated in resume review events, speed networking events, and more. Each gave an opportunity for participants to get feedback on their resumes and/or practice interviewing. I am so excited that we were able to offer internships to GWC alumni and thrilled that we had Kelsey, Tamara and Israa here with us this summer.""Kim is currently working as a full stack developer intern with the U.S. Bank talech group, a cloud-based software team, focusing her internship on business customer point-of-sale (POS) systems, which she said hits close to home for her.""It been amazing to learn about new technologies and experience working in a professional environment,"" Kim said.""It's so interesting to work with everyone involved in the front-end visual elements that users interact with, to the back-end services that power those interactions. I was also really excited about the product since my parents own a restaurant only a couple minutes away from the office, and POS software is something that is an integral part of how the business runs,"" she said. ""Now, many businesses are transitioning toward digitalization and self-service models, and the demand for efficient POS software is increasing. The relevance of the work and product is something I really appreciate.""On the other side of Atlanta, Kunter has been embedded into the U.S. Bank Elavon payments team focused on quality assurance. And in Minneapolis, Mohammed has been working with the engineering team.""I work on the Quality Assurance team for Electronic Transfer System,"" Kunter said. ""Specifically, I have been tasked with automating test cases for a hosted payment page. The purpose of this is to make it easier, faster and more reliable while ensuring that the functionality of the website was not disrupted after changes/updates to the website.""Each of the young women said they aspire to use their technical and coding skills in their future careers.

Forbes' annual ranking was created to help women identify companies that serve their needs and for companies to evaluate their own support of women in their workplaces.""We are very intentional and deliberate about our culture here at Cintas,"" said Todd Schneider, Cintas President and CEO. ""Our corporate culture is the foundation of everything we do and guides how we run our business. Our goal is to foster a workplace environment that allows every one of our employee-partners to succeed. We have unbelievably talented women throughout our company. We want to make sure they are fulfilled, happy and successful at Cintas, so we continue to attract and retain even more extraordinary talent to help drive our business ahead.""Karen Carnahan, currently a member of Cintas' Board of Directors, is a former 35-year Cintas employee-partner. She joined Cintas in 1979 as an accountant and rose through the ranks to Vice President and Treasurer then Vice President of Corporate Development before she was tapped as President and COO of the company's former Document Management business. When that business merged with Shred-It in 2014, she served as its COO until her retirement in 2015. Carnahan was elected to Cintas' Board in 2019.Like Schneider, Carnahan credits the Fortune 500 company's culture for its success - especially its influence on creating opportunities and support for its female workforce.""You can't overstate the power of the corporate culture,"" Carnahan said. ""When I joined the company back in 1979, I said to myself, ‘This company is truly unique.' Our culture is the distinct thing that's made us successful as a company and has also created tremendous opportunities for women that I have not seen at other companies.""Story continuesForbes' Best Employers for Women 2023 list was determined in partnership with global research firm Statista. About 40,000 women were asked to rate their company in areas such as working environment, salary, and employee diversity, and if they would recommend their company to a friend or family member. Other questions evaluated their perspectives on their employers' pay equity, parental leave policies, leadership training programs for women and employer responses to workplace issues. Statista conducted additional research into women's representation in company's executive management and board positions to help round out the rankings.""We know that our employee-partners value our support in all areas of their lives, especially outside of work,"" said Max Langenkamp, Cintas Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Chief Diversity Officer. ""We look to offer an outstanding menu of benefits to our employee-partners - and that's especially true for women and mothers. We've intentionally expanded support for mothers and parents in recent years and continue to seek opportunities to help them in and out of work,"" Langenkamp added.Melanie Barstad, another Director on Cintas' Board, worked at the Johnson &amp; Johnson Family of Companies for 23 years before retiring in 2009 as President of Women's Health in its Medical Device and Diagnostics Division. She also served as the co-chair of Johnson &amp; Johnson's world-renowned Women's Leadership Initiative. She's been a Director at Cintas since 2011 and recognizes Cintas' dedication to its employee-partners - including its female workforce.""Cintas is committed to diversity,"" said Barstad. ""We're committed to inclusiveness. We're committed to doing the right thing for our employee-partners and for the women that work here. And I'm honored and humbled to be able to be part of Cintas, and to be a part of bringing attention to the women at Cintas.""About Cintas CorporationCintas Corporation helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing products and services that help keep their customers' facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best.

Shares have lost about 9.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Edwards Lifesciences due for a breakout?

On an underlying basis, the upside was 69.2%. The uptick is driven by overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure growth and the ongoing launch and growing adoption of the PASCAL Precision system in Europe and the United States. This figure compares with our second quarter’s TMTT model’s projection of $43.2 million.Surgical Structural Heart sales in the quarter totaled $256.3 million, up 12.2% from the year-ago quarter’s levels on a reported basis and 13.3% on an underlying basis.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.4%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Based on the last payment, Walmart was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 51.4%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.88 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.28. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.9% over that duration. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that Walmart has been growing its earnings per share at 24% a year over the past five years. Walmart is clearly able to grow rapidly while still returning cash to shareholders, positioning it to become a strong dividend payer in the future.Walmart Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Walmart that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

But instead of generating hype, citing shrink softens the blow of sinking profits.The most prominent mention of shrink in recent weeks came from Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS).On a call with analysts following its Aug. 22 earnings report, CFO Navdeep Gupta said, ""The biggest impact in terms of the surprise for Q2 primarily came from shrink."" Gupta went on to say, ""The number of incidents and the organized retail crime impact came in significantly higher than we anticipated."" The company cut its full-year profit outlook in response.The theme of missing merchandise also featured in recent calls from Dollar Tree (DLTR), Macy's (M), Home Depot (HD), and Target (TGT).Dick's Sporting Goods profit slipped in its second quarter and missed Wall Street's expectations as the retailer cut its full-year profit outlook, citing worries over theft at its stores. (Seth Wenig/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Analysts say the trend reflects a real problem for retailers, and one that they are taking steps to prevent.""Nobody wants to come out and say, 'We are not in control,'"" said David Johnston, NRF vice president of asset protection and retail operations. ""To see the number of CEOs coming out and talking about shrink and loss — it's an issue.""Dollar Tree, for instance, told investors it is installing locked cases on more items and even taking some SKUs out of stores in response to elevated theft. ""We are now taking a very defensive approach to shrink,"" Dollar Tree CEO Rick Dreiling told analysts this week.And as executives continue to hammer on the industry-wide threat coming from shrink, the concept has gathered momentum and can work as a crutch for explaining weaker financial performance.""There is a bandwagon effect here,"" said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData. ""When one retailer starts to call something out, others will look at it. And because everyone is interested in it, that fuels more mentions of theft.""Story continuesGrowing 'shrink'But data suggests that behind a new industry-wide excuse for business slowing down is an uptick in theft and increasing concerns for safety.Retailers say that shrink amounted to $94.5 billion in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation’s (NRF) annual of survey of companies, up from $90.8 billion in 2020. As a percentage of sales, however, that figure came out to about 1.4% of sales, down from 1.6% in 2020.Retailers also reported a 26.5% increase in organized retail crime incidents, when groups of professional shoplifters steal and resell stolen goods. While the latest figures are nearly two years old, sustained commentary from executives suggests that shrink is a growing problem for them.Jonathan Simon, a criminal justice professor at UC Berkeley School of Law, said businesses probably do have relatively accurate estimates of how much their inventory is shrinking due to theft. And that it's possible retail theft has increased partially because of online resale platforms, which serve as a conduit for organized theft for profit.""But businesses also have an incentive to place more emphasis on theft as it shifts the responsibility for business shrinkage — never a good look to investors or customers — to an abstract but blameworthy factor like organized crime,"" he said.The public also has a tendency to place all retail theft in the same category, he added, lumping together organized theft, survival theft by unhoused or very poor people, and teenagers and younger adults acting out by stealing. ""Each of these really needs to be seen as distinct problems with distinct solutions.""A Nordstrom department store at the Grove mall in Los Angeles, where a smash-and-grab robbery drew attention to organized retails thefts. (Jae C. Hong/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Beyond the 'smash and grab'The dramatic crime figures and sensationalized videos that have drawn broader public attention have also invited criticism that the problem might be overblown.In a widely covered backtrack, Walgreens CFO James Kehoe said earlier this year that the pharmacy chain ""cried too much"" about theft on a prior earnings call that was among the first to ignite concerns about retail crime.But retail industry experts insist this quarter's references to shrink aren't merely executives crying wolf.Janine Stichter, a research analyst covering consumer retail and lifestyle platforms at BTIG, said citing shrink figures isn't something that you can fake for very long.Stichter sees the timing of shrink's big moment in earnings calls, which picked up at the end of last year, as coinciding with price increases and a weaker economic environment, highlighting a link between crime and a tougher economy.Under the strain of higher costs, consumers squeezed by inflation, and shifts in shopping habits, the industry faces a host of challenges even without the pain and risks of theft.""Shrink is clearly an issue, but so is the tremendous volatility that the consumer and retail has experienced over the last nearly four years,"" said Ethan Chernofsky, senior vice president of marketing at Placer.ai, a location analytics firm.""The pandemic presented a unique set of circumstances and just when we expected a period of normalcy as the pandemic's effects faded, a wide array of economic challenges disrupted retail 'normalcy.'""Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Most Searched Products on Amazon.A Digital WorldOn June 26, PwC reported that 55% of global consumers resort to making a quick search in order to find relevant information before any purchase. 35% resort to finding their favorite product on e-commerce websites like Amazon while 33% tend to go to individual websites of the company whose product they are looking for. A niche of customers also relies on online customer reviews to make sure they are buying the right thing online.Emergence of the Online Shopping EraThe trend of online shopping emerged after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world. This pandemic is said to have altered mainstream consumer behavior forever. Eventually after Covid, in 2020, McKinsey reported that people who stepped into the online world for the first time to buy groceries, medicine, or household supplies during the pandemic believed that they would be making purchases online in the future as well, depicting a permanent shift in their buying habits. This trend has penetrated across different age groups in different ways. Gen Z is said to be interested in clothing, beauty, and footwear products while millennials continue to spend a large amount on household items. Lastly, Gen X has the lowest adoption rates for online shopping.Forces Motivating Online ShoppersWhat comes across our minds is a common question, that is, why would someone like you prefer online retail over visiting a brick-and-mortar store where you could probably even feel the product? The answer to this question is not just one. The major factor that drives a person to a screen more than a store is price. Considering the recent trend of inflation where people are living from one paycheck to another, they seem to look for affordable options online. They can also make price comparisons to choose the best fit for themselves. Another force behind millions of online sales is the convenience being offered by e-commerce platforms and retail websites. In the blink of an eye, you can scroll, choose a product, add it to your cart, and make a payment. You can also track the delivery of your product to know when you are going to receive it.Story continuesThe E-Commerce MarketIn February 2023, ReportLinker reported that the global e-commerce market will grow from $2.83 trillion in 2022 to $3.18 trillion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate of 12.2%.Recent trends in this market include the use of Customer Relationship Management software to automate the whole product delivery process. Apart from this, e-commerce websites use machine learning algorithms based on consumers' previous buying history or preferences. No wonder we get to see the products we are looking for just randomly in the form of sponsored ads from websites like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Furthermore, SEO tools such as Google Analytics are being used to view metrics such as how the website is doing, which keywords people generally use to reach a company’s website, the traffic, and the average time spent by a user on a webpage.The concept of e-commerce and its due significance is being recognized not just by big economies like the US and Canada which have a number of e-commerce platforms of their own but also by third-world countries for instance India. On August 20, MSN reported that The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade has been involved in compiling a national-level e-commerce strategy for India. This strategy has been made in consensus with different retailers, medium-sized businesses, and local traders with an aim to integrate the e-commerce supply chain, improve exports for the market, and create an inclusive environment for every e-commerce business to operate.Major PlayersNotable names in the e-commerce market include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). Let’s have a look at all of these.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the largest online retailer as of 2023. The American multinational corporation operates in different domains such as computer hardware, cloud computing, and e-commerce. The company started off as an online book-selling website but has grown to become everyone’s favorite online ‘everything store’. On August 3, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.65 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.31. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $134.38 billion, up 10.85% year over year and ahead of revenue expectations by $3.04 billion.Founded 17 years ago, the e-commerce giant, Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), is among the top 10 Canadian companies according to market capitalization. It operates in 175 countries around the world, assisting online retailers with product placements, sales, and payments. On August 2, the company reported $1.7 billion in revenue for the second quarter of 2023, up 31% compared to the previous year.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American chain of hypermarkets operating in 24 different countries. On August 17, Reuters reported that the sales for certain commodities have increased for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), attributing it to the low prices. These products include low-priced clothing, fitness products, and groceries. Although consumers in the US are currently experiencing high-interest rates and inflation, they continue to spend on Walmart’s Inc. (NYSE:WMT) products, considering them an affordable option and contributing to a 4 to 4.5% increase in the company’s revenue from last year. Elaborating on the future prospects of Walmart in the light of higher expected inflation in the US, Charles Sizemore, one of the Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) investors, commented:""While Walmart has a lot to celebrate this quarter, they are right to manage expectations for the rest of the year""One of the top 10 e-commerce platforms in the world, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is another American e-commerce player that operates in 32 countries. It has an online auction website where sellers list their products for consumers worldwide. On July 9, Morningstar reported that eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is well positioned for long-term growth as it has been focusing on its core business of reselling items online, as it has failed in other businesses like logistics.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a Chinese e-commerce player that works in diverse businesses such as online retail, cloud computing, and logistics. The company is one of the most valuable firms in the world. It now operates in the form of 6 business groups namely Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao &amp; Tmall Group, Local Services Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Group, Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group, and Digital Media and Entertainment Group.Amazon–The Ultimate Marketplace for SellersApart from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) being the go-to place for consumers, it also serves to be a career for many. The company itself reports that 60% of its multichannel suppliers consider Amazon as their fastest-growing channel.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the largest e-commerce website and the most trusted platform in the United States as of 2022. Potentially, every seller would want that kind of reach. The company just knows how to bring customers to buy, leaving them contended with their purchase decisions. Other than global exposure, firms around the world know that they need an online presence after the massive shift in consumer activity from in stores to online.Sellers offering their products on Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) also get access to various other benefits. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)  celebrates an annual Prime Day on which Prime members exclusively enjoy discounts from sellers. The most recent Prime Day was held on July 11 and recorded the highest-ever sales and customer savings in the history of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The platform also provides an opportunity to small business owners through Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) Small Business Academy, which helps small business owners to navigate through their business journey. This platform helps from launching the business to learning business concepts through webinars to networking by meeting up with industry experts and finally becoming a strong market player.On August 15, Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) reported that independent sellers resort to the platform because they get the power to reach millions by just launching their product without spending a huge budget on acquiring potential customers. Elaborating on this value-adding nature of the business for sellers, the CEO of ASM Games, Alfred Mai, said:""The nice thing about Amazon is that everyone has an equal opportunity; any small idea you can make happen. You don’t have to be this big company to launch a product. It doesn’t matter how small you are, we are able to compete with some of the biggest players.""The Downside Placement on Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) website is the key for sellers. However, this key comes at a cost. Sellers are obliged to pay a marketing cost for their products to be displayed on the default page.Another con of being a seller on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is that you face commoditization. This is when so many similar brands operate in the same category that they appear more as commodities than as brands since consumers begin to view them the same way. In this competitive environment, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) itself can offer competition to sellers. An example of this could be ‘AmazonBasics’, a brand solely owned by the company itself, selling high rated products at better prices. Batteries could be a good example of this. Amazon’s very own batteries have done exceptionally well in the market and hence are a rival force to the existing battery sellers.Reviews can also make or break a brand. Companies need to use these reviews as game changers for them. In this regard, they also have to comply with the customer review rules set by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which banned incentivized reviews back in 2016. This was because sellers used to offer free products for people to review them. The company doesn’t allow sellers to offer any kind of incentive to customers for reviews such as money, discounts or even a request for positive feedback. Sellers can also not leave reviews for any of their competitors.In conclusion, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has set these rules to ensure that buyers express their true opinions on the website so other buyers can make informed decisions and so that sellers constantly evolve and grow by learning from customer feedback.

20,ccd38a37-1983-3d31-9e74-d0bf2f07c70b,WMT,2023-08-26,"Walmart, Alphabet’s Wing partner on Dallas drone delivery",FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-alphabet-wing-partner-dallas-210646778.html,1692997606,STORY,['WMT'],"[A Wing drone carries a Walmart-branded cargo box. (Photo: Wing)This story originally appeared at flyingmag.com.Walmart has gained a reputation as a home to some of the weirdest and wackiest shoppers among us. If you live in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area, you may be able to avoid them.The massive retailer on Thursday announced a partnership with Wing, the drone delivery arm of Google parent Alphabet, to deliver quick meals, groceries, household essentials, over-the-counter medicines and more to residents through the air. Deliveries are expected to arrive in under 30 minutes straight to customers’ yards, driveways, front doorsteps or other location of their choosing.The service will launch from two Walmart Supercenters in the coming weeks and reach around 60,000 homes.“This is a major milestone for Wing as we continue down our path toward building capabilities to support some of the most significant delivery operations in the world,” wrote Shannon Nash, chief financial officer of Wing, in a blog post. “Our technology is designed to complement existing delivery offerings, making overall systems more efficient and able to meet real customer needs.”The partners will begin with a Walmart store at 8555 Preston Road in the northern suburb of Frisco, adding large sections of the central and eastern parts of the town to its service area. Customers had been requesting an expansion since the service began delivering to Frisco in 2021.Dallas-Fort Worth-area residents can determine if they are eligible for drone deliveries by downloading the Wing app, creating an account and entering their addresses. A “Coming Soon” message means they will be eligible for the new service on Day 1. The app may also say a resident is eligible but does not live in the right area — Wing said it will add additional neighborhoods soon and to check back “in a few weeks.”A second nearby store will join the delivery network before the end of this year, with more expected down the road. For now, the service will be available to homes within 6 miles of participating stores.Story continuesWhen the expanded Dallas service launches, Wing said it will expand hours of operation to 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. to provide more evening service. It will also extend availability to six days a week, delivering every day except Wednesday.For Walmart, the partnership builds on more than two years operating drone delivery services in the U.S. The retailer has completed more than 10,000 deliveries out of 36 stores across seven states. It currently operates 11 drone hubs in the Dallas area and will now add two more. Most of these are overseen by longtime drone logistics partner DroneUp.“Working with Wing directly aligns with our passion for finding innovative and eco-friendly last-mile delivery solutions to get customers the items they want, when they want them,” wrote Prathibha Rajashekhar, senior vice president of innovation and automation for Walmart U.S., in a blog post. “With drones that can fly beyond visual line of sight, we’re able to unlock on-demand delivery for customers living within an approximate 6-mile range of the stores that offer the service.”Wing’s drones cruise at around 65 mph and use a tether to deliver cargo to precise locations in urban and suburban settings. Operators oversee the aircraft from remote command centers, flying beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) in many cases. The company relies on its Wing Delivery Network model, which uses stores as delivery hubs, allocates drones across the network and enables convenient options like curbside pickup.Wing first landed in the Dallas area in 2021, when it began trialing a delivery model that staged delivery drones in tiny hangars at Walgreens retail locations: on roofs, in parking lots and adjacent to the building.Its commercial service in the area launched in full in April 2022, delivering from Walgreens, Blue Bell Creameries, Easyvet and an array of local and national retailers. At many locations, store associates load the drones rather than Wing employees. Earlier this year, it began offering special deliveries to events in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, such as sunscreen for pool parties or orange slices for soccer games.The company also flies in Christiansburg, Virginia, where it launched its first U.S. service in 2019. Its biggest services, though, are in Australia; it’s flown in Queensland since 2019, where the city of Logan (a suburb of Brisbane) sometimes sees 1,000 deliveries per day. Wing has also delivered in Helsinki since 2019.The post Walmart, Alphabet’s Wing partner on Dallas drone delivery appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Of course, the downbeat month and the recent stretch of volatility are not pleasant in the moment. But pullbacks are healthy and vital parts of the stock market and one was desperately needed after the huge rally.The market swung between solid gains and losses through early afternoon trading on Friday as Wall Street attempted to make sense of Jay Powell’s Jackson Hole speech and its impact on near-term price action. Stocks then surged higher once again near the end of the session.The Fed chair continued to stay the course, saying the central bank is “prepared to raise rates further if appropriate,” while aiming to “proceed carefully.” Various headlines pointed to different snippets. The Fed boss also said that inflation was still “too high” and that they intend to “hold policy at a restrictive level” until prices cool even more.Powell was never going to declare victory with core inflation still solidly above the Fed’s floating target range. And investors should be pleased the Fed isn’t growing complacent since slightly higher rates for longer is a far better scenario than rebounding inflation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTaking a giant step back, August has been a historically bad month for the stock market over the last 30 or so years. More importantly, the downturn this time around was also very much needed to help cool things off after the huge rally. Plus, S&amp;P 500 earnings are projected to grow by double digits in both 2024 and 2025.The foundation that drove the market comeback is still in place. Investors with long-term horizons who can block out the near-term noise might want to consider buying proven large cap stocks and holding them for the long haul. The three stocks we explore today are Caterpillar (CAT), Walmart (WMT), and Visa (V).Story continuesCaterpillar (CAT) and its iconic yellow machines are the titans of the construction and mining sector, and business is booming. Caterpillar is benefitting from the ongoing surge in construction spending in the U.S. and it is set to benefit over the next decade-plus from the U.S. government-backed push for infrastructure spending, reshoring, and beyond.CAT topped our Q2 estimates in early August and boosted its guidance, with it projected to post massive top and bottom-line growth this year. Caterpillar’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. Meanwhile, CAT’s dividend tops its highly-ranked industry’s average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar stock has more than doubled the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years, with it also up 230% in the past 10 years vs. the benchmark’s 170%. CAT stock has surged 40% in the last year. The stock is trading around 7% below its recent highs and still above its 50-day moving average.

But he is still holding on tightly to this notion that they are watching it carefully and they still have work to do,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.All of the major S&amp;P 500 sectors rose, with consumer discretionary, technology and energy among the top gainers.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 247.48 points, or 0.73%, to 34,346.9, the S&amp;P 500 gained 29.4 points, or 0.67%, to 4,405.71 and the Nasdaq Composite added 126.67 points, or 0.94%, to 13,590.65.The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq also ended higher for the week, with the Nasdaq rising about 2.3% and ending a three-week streak of losses. The market rose in the run up to Nvidia's second-quarter results Wednesday.The company, which makes chips designed for artificial intelligence tasks, gave another upbeat forecast with its report.Following Powell's comments Friday, expectations of a rate hike in November rose from a day earlier, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.

This morning's price action was volatile thanks to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the central bank's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Stocks climbed steadily higher throughout the afternoon, though, to end the week on a high note.All eyes were on Fed Chair Powell this morning, who gave his Jackson Hole speech shortly after the opening bell. Powell acknowledged that it is a ""welcome development"" that inflation has come down from its 40-year peak of 9.1% hit in June 2022. And while he said the Fed will ""proceed carefully,"" he stuck largely to his script from the past year that the central bank will remain data dependent, but is willing to do whatever it takes to bring inflation down, even if that means more interest rate hikes.""Additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy,"" Powell said in his speech.Powell's remarks recognized the uncertain path of the long road ahead to bringing inflation back down to the Fed's 2% target, says Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.""In recognizing the uncertain path, Powell has opened the door for more optionality over the medium term as the Fed assesses the trajectory of the economy and the effects of current monetary policy."" In other words, the Fed cannot with certainty say that they are done hiking rates until they get a really good read on where the economy is headed, Ripley says.November rate-hike expectations riseFollowing the central bank's quarter percentage point rate hike in July, futures traders are currently pricing an 81% chance of a pause at the next Fed meeting in September, according to CME Group. However, the probability for a 0.25% rate hike at the November meeting has risen to 48% from 33% in the past week.Story continuesTreasury yields spiked after Powell's speech, with the 2-year yield reaching 5.095% in intraday action – its highest level since April 2007. This sent the rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite swinging from an early morning gain of 1.2% to a 0.6% loss within a 45-minute span. However, the tech-heavy index quickly stabilized and ended the day up 0.9% at 13,590.Similar but not as severe price action was seen in the broader S&amp;P 500 (+0.7% to 4,405) and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7% to 34,346), with both ending comfortably higher on the day.Nordstrom is the latest retail stock to sink after earningsWhile the bulk of today's headlines revolved around Powell's Jackson Hole speech, there were some notable storylines to be found elsewhere. Nordstrom (JWN), for one, became the latest retail stock to spiral after earnings, with shares tumbling 7.7% today. The department store chain reported higher-than-expected earnings of 84 cents per share on revenue of $3.8 billion.And while the company reiterated its full-year forecast, Cathy Smith, chief financial officer of Nordstrom, said on its earnings call that it continues ""to see a cautious consumer, and it remains to be seen how changes will affect discretionary consumer spending in the second half of the year, particularly during holiday season."" JWN also joined several other retailers in warning of historically high levels of theft.Elsewhere, Rite Aid (RAD) plummeted 51.0% after a report in The Wall Street Journal indicated the embattled drug store chain was getting ready to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to the WSJ, the filing would cover the company's roughly $3.3 billion in debt, as well as the costs incurred from the substantial federal and state lawsuits it is facing for its alleged role in the opioid crisis.Fed's favorite inflation data, Salesforce earnings on tapLooking to next week, the second reading on Q2 gross domestic product and the June personal consumption and expenditures index (PCE) – the Fed's preferred measure of inflation – are key economic reports to watch.As for the earnings calendar, results from blue chip tech giant Salesforce (CRM) and yoga apparel maker Lululemon Athletica (LULU) will be in focus.Related ContentIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Amazon Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayUlta Earnings Beat Expectations With Growth In Major CategoriesSavings Rates of 5%+: It's Time to Switch]"

It is calculated based on historical multiples, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Nordstrom Inc (JWN) a Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Nordstrom should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.5. These indicators suggest that Nordstrom, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Demystifying the Altman Z-scoreThe Altman Z-score, invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Snapshot: Nordstrom Inc (NYSE:JWN)Nordstrom is a fashion retailer that operates about 94 department stores and approximately 245 off-price Nordstrom Rack stores. The company also operates both full- and off-price e-commerce sites, two clearance stores, and seven Local locations. Nordstrom's largest merchandise categories are women's apparel (28% of 2022 sales), shoes (26% of 2022 sales), men's apparel (15% of 2022 sales), and women's accessories (13% of 2022 sales). Nordstrom, which traces its history to a shoe store opened in Seattle in 1901, continues to be partially owned and managed by members of the eponymous family.Story continuesIs Nordstrom Inc (JWN) a Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsUnpacking Nordstrom's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Nordstrom's Altman Z-score reveals Nordstrom's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Nordstrom's historical data, we observe a declining trend in this ratio, indicating Nordstrom's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Nordstrom's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data indicates a recent dip following an initial rise. This reduction suggests that Nordstrom might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, Nordstrom Inc (NYSE:JWN) might be a potential value trap due to certain risk factors. These risks, reflected through its low Altman Z-score, suggest potential financial distress. Therefore, investors are advised to conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The company also witnessed sequential improvement in sales at Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack stores.Nordstrom posted adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share, up 3.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of 81 cents. Earnings per share also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents.Total revenues of $3,772 million declined 8.3% year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,665 million. Dismal revenues resulted from a 275-basis-point (bps) adverse impact of the wind-down of Canada operations and an 8.5% decline in gross merchandise value (""GMV""). Sales were also hurt by declines across the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack banners. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have gained 6.6% year to date against the industry’s decline of 1.1%.Quarterly HighlightsNet sales fell 8.2% year over year to $3,662 million but surpassed our estimate of $3,505.7 million.

In the fiscal second quarter, digital sales contributed 36% to net sales.Nordstrom's gross profit margin contracted 20 bps year over year to 35% for the reported quarter mainly due to deleverage on lower sales, partly offset by lower buying and occupancy costs.SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, remained flat year over year to 33%, driven by improvements in variable costs stemming from supply-chain efficiency initiatives, favorable carrier rates and gains from the sale of a real estate asset. These were offset by higher labor costs and deleverage from lower sales.Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $316 million fell 7.3% year over year in the fiscal second quarter. The adjusted EBIT margin was flat in the fiscal second quarter to 5.3%.Story continuesOther FinancialsNordstrom ended second-quarter fiscal 2023 with available liquidity of $1.7 billion, including $885 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $800 million available on its revolving credit facility.

The dividend yield will be 5.7% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Huntington Bancshares' Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable.Huntington Bancshares has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 39%, which means that Huntington Bancshares would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to fall by 9.9%. Despite that, analysts estimate the future payout ratio could be 47% over the same time period, which is in a pretty comfortable range.historic-dividendHuntington Bancshares Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.16 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.62. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.Huntington Bancshares Could Grow Its DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Huntington Bancshares has been growing its earnings per share at 5.4% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.Huntington Bancshares Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Huntington Bancshares that investors should take into consideration.

DKNG.Industry: GamingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2140284/2-gaming-stocks-to-buy-from-a-promising-industryThe Zacks Gaming industry is benefiting from improving visitation. Positive trends in Macau's gaming earnings are contributing to the sector's growth. Moreover, robust demand for sports betting is aiding the industry. The expansion of online betting offerings bodes well. Stocks like MGM Resorts International and DraftKings Inc. will likely gain traction from this upbeat demand.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Gaming industry includes companies that primarily own and operate integrated casinos, hotels and entertainment resorts. Some industry players also deliver technology products and services across lotteries, electronic gaming machines, sports betting and interactive gaming. Some firms develop and operate gaming establishments and associated lodging, restaurant, horse racing and entertainment amenities. Many companies are also involved in developing and selling gaming applications. E-sports or sporting events or tournament services, content management systems, video software, mobile applications and e-sports data platform solutions are provided as well.Key Themes Shaping the Gaming IndustryVisitation Improving: The industry is benefiting from improving visitation. In July, Macau's gross gaming revenue (GGR) jumped 4,082.9% year over year to MOP$16.66 billion (US$2.06 billion). For the first seven months of 2023, GGR is up 263% year over year. Robust investment will continue to aid the gaming industry in Macau. In the next 10 years, six casino companies will invest nearly $15 billion.U.S. Commercial Gaming Revenues Make Record: The gaming industry in the United States continues to perform better than expected. Per the American Gaming Association data, revenues from gambling hit a record high of $60.42 billion in 2022. In 2022, sports betting increased 72.7% year over year. In the first and the second quarter of 2023, U.S. commercial gaming revenues reached $16.6 and $16.07 billion. This marks the industry's tenth straight record-breaking quarter. The U.S. gaming industry will continue to improve.Story continuesSports Betting a Major Driver: The legalization of sports betting in Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Montana, Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois and New Hampshire has been driving growth for a while. Moreover, bettors can now place wagers via digital platforms in Connecticut, Kentucky, Michigan, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, California, Oregon, Arizona, Montana, Colorado and other states. Some popular gaming applications include DraftKings, Barstool, FanDuel, BetMGM, BetRivers, Fox Bet and BetMonarch.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Gaming industry is grouped within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #109, which places it in the top 44% of more than 245 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Since Mar 31, 2023, the industry's northbound estimate for the current year has increased 221.4%.Given their strong fundamentals, we will present a few gaming stocks that one can add to the investment portfolio. But it's worth looking at the industry's shareholder returns and its current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector and the S&amp;P 500The Zacks Gaming industry has outpaced the S&amp;P 500 Index and the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector over the past year.The industry has gained 14.9% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500 Index's increase of 6.3% and the sector's gain of 1.1%.Gaming Industry's Valuation Since gaming companies are debt-laden, valuing the same based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio makes sense. The industry currently has a forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.00. The space is trading at a discount compared to the market at large, as the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 11.07.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.73X and as low as 5.93X, with a median of 14.00X.2 Gaming Stocks to WatchMGM Resorts: Based in Las Vegas, Nevada, MGM Resorts is benefiting from increased business volume and travel activity, primarily at MGM China and Las Vegas Strip Resorts. Also, focus on international expansion, sports betting, asset-light strategy and non-gaming activities bodes well. The company is optimistic regarding BetMGM operations as it anticipates revenue contributions of $1.8 billion-$2 billion in 2023.Shares of this presently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have increased 22.4% in the past year. In the past 30 days, earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 17.6% to $2.47. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.DraftKings: Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, DraftKings is benefiting from increasing global demand for online gambling and sports betting. DraftKings is live with mobile sports betting in 21 states that collectively represent approximately 44% of the U.S. population. The company operates iGaming in five states, representing approximately 11% of the U.S. population.Shares of this presently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) player have increased 59.6% in the past year. Moreover, DKNG's 2023 earnings and sales are anticipated to increase 49.1% and 57.7% each from the respective year-ago reported figures.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

He then graduated to coal and logging.""He kinda did everything,"" Brent said of his father.Frank got started in the tire business by building a shed next to the family home in Flat Lick in order to change his own tires on the trucks he used to haul coal. Then people began to stop by for help and Frank realized the time might be right to set up shop.Frank brought his kids up in the business from an early age. Brent started out by stacking tires.Initially he thought he wanted to do something else — studying marketing at Eastern Kentucky University. But he and his wife Nina both formally joined the business in 1998.""It got in our blood, so I had to come back,"" Brent said.It was about that time that Bingham Tire &amp; Oil moved to its current location at 561 South US Hwy 25E in Barbourville. The location offers five vehicle bays as well as a 126-foot truck bay.In the beginning, the shop primarily served the coal industry but has since grown to service over-the-road trucks along with offering preventative maintenance for private vehicles and commercial trucks.Now going into their seventh decade, Bingham Tire &amp; Oil has expanded services several times over the years. In addition to selling new and used tires, they have a state-of-the-art retread or cap shop for refurbishing tires. The tires are certified GAR (Goodyear Authorized Retread), the brand Bingham has dealt in since the beginning.""We cap a Goodyear-built product whether Goodyear, Cooper, Roadmaster, Kelley,"" Brent said of the American made brands. ""Once we cap it, it's the same as a new tire with warranty.""Brent estimate that Bingham Tire caps 7-8 tires for every new one they sell.""We take old tires and make them new again,"" Brent said. ""We do about 2,000 to 2,300 tires a month. Every tire we do is saving about 75% of oil, carbon black and everything it takes to make a new tire. So we're probably one of the biggest recyclers in this area that people don't realize about.""Story continuesNot only can customers bring their tires into the shop but Bingham Tire will also pick them up and deliver.Bingham Tire is currently in the process of expanding into wheel refurbishment. The process involves sandblasting, powder coating and painting to function as new wheels.Bingham Tire has also branched out in terms of geography — with locations in Somerset and Clinton, Tennessee, as well as a partnership with a Lexington dealer. Their service area ranges from Roanoke, Virginia to Nashville, Tennessee.""If you're not growing, you're on the back slide,"" Brent said. ""We try to keep expanding where it fits us.""Through it all, Bingham Tire remains very much a family business with Frank, now 89 and retired, still stopping by daily. They firmly believe it's just as important to treat their customers as family too.""The difference between us and other tire dealers — if someone needs me, they can call me,"" Brent said. ""I'm the owner and I'll talk to them. I still deliver tires and work in the cap shop — whatever needs to be done. We're local; we know the market and the people. It's a family, no matter what. That's the way we look at it.""]"

Photo: George Rose/Getty ImagesBlackstone will sell a 22 percent stake in the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas, in a deal that values the hotel at nearly $1 billion more than when Blackstone bought it in 2019.The real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income agreed to buy the stake, which Blackstone has reportedly been shopping around for months, for $300 million, the Wall Street Journal first reported. As part of the deal, Realty Income will also drop $650 million in preferred equity interest into the new joint venture with Blackstone, according to both companies.Las Vegas has recovered since the pandemic decimated the tourism industry, with visitor volume and spending up in 2022 and two new professional sports teams preparing to make Sin City their home, the WSJ reported. And the Bellagio’s value shows the strength of Las Vegas’ recovery.Blackstone — through its REIT Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT) — spent $4.25 billion to buy the Bellagio from MGM Resorts in 2019, and its latest deal with Realty Income values the 4,000-room hotel at $5.1 billion.“Where you invest matters, and this transaction demonstrates the strong investor demand for the high-quality assets we have assembled within BREIT,” Nadeem Meghji, head of Blackstone Real Estate Americas, said in a statement.Blackstone has bet big on Las Vegas, having roughly $20 billion of Las Vegas property in its portfolio as of March, and its gamble has been paying off in recent years. In 2021, the real estate giant sold The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas to a group of investors, including MGM, for $5.65 billion seven years after it bought the hotel and casino for $1.8 billion.And, at the end of 2022, it agreed to sell its 49.9 percent stake in the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay hotels to Vici Properties at a $5.5 billion valuation, which reportedly generated a more than $700 million profit for Blackstone.But not all of Blackstone’s Las Vegas bets have been wins. In March, the $325 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan on Blackstone’s Hughes Center office campus hit special servicing after Blackstone provided a hardship letter stating its inability to fund future monthly payments.Story continuesIts Bellagio deal with Realty Income — which owns 13,100 properties primarily through net lease agreements — is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter of the year.Nicholas Rizzi can be reached at nrizzi@commercialobserver.com.Trending Commercial Observer StoriesGrocer Met Fresh Opening 14K-SF Ridgewood, Queens StoreRolling Stone and Variety Publisher Penske Media Signs Big Office Expansion in LAPower LA 2023Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged But Uncertainty Persists for CRE MarketDominican Republic Bank BanReservas Opening First NYC Outpost at Radio Tower &amp; HotelRead the original story Blackstone Sells 22% Stake in Bellagio to Realty Income and others by Nicholas Rizzi at Commercial Observer.]"

Despite a two-day rebound, WTI remained below the key $80 per barrel mark. The U.S. crude benchmark also finished the week down 1.7%, after shedding 2.3% last week. Prior to that, it rose for seven straight weeks in a rally that lifted WTI by nearly 20%.London-traded Brent settled up $1.12, or 1.3%, at $84.48 per barrel. Compared with WTI, Brent’s current week loss was far more modest at just 0.4%, adding to the previous week’s 2.3% drop. Before that, the global crude benchmark also rose for seven weeks in a row, rising by a total of 18%.“Oil prices recovered a little toward the back end of the week after coming under some pressure this month,” noted Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Supply cuts from OPEC+ continue to support the market but uncertainty over the global economic outlook - sluggish recovery in China, possible recession in the U.S. and Europe - are weighing a little.”Friday’s rebound in oil may have been crimped somewhat by signals from the Fed that it intended to keep U.S. interest rates higher for as long as needed to bring inflation back to its long-term target of 2% per annum.“It is the Fed's job to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal, and we will do so,” Chairman Jerome Powell said, opening the central bank’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming that has become one of the financial world’s most-watched events for anyone wanting a clue on where U.S. interest rates may be headed.The Fed chief made clear that U.S. rates will follow inflationary pressure. “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective,” Powell said.Story continuesInflation hit four-decade highs of more than 9% per annum in June 2022 due to trillions of dollars of federal relief spending following the 2020 coronavirus outbreak. The Fed responded with its most aggressive rate hikes in 20 years, going from a base rate of just 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.5%.While pandemic-related spending is over and price growth has stabilized at 3% per annum now, a robust labor market has allowed Americans to continue spending, preventing the Fed from achieving its target for inflation.Weekly jobless claims have continued to decline in the United States, with unemployment hitting more than 50-year lows, while average hourly earnings haven’t contracted in a single month since April 2021.Also weighing on oil was the notion that global supplies could rise. While Russia might be deliberately putting out less oil in collaboration with the Saudis to get higher prices for a barrel, Venezuela and Iran — two other countries sanctioned by the United States — might be shipping more crude soon, reports said this week.U.S. officials were drafting a proposal that would ease sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, allowing more companies and countries to import its crude oil, if the South American nation moves toward a free and fair presidential election, five people with knowledge of the plans told Reuters.Iran also said this week its crude output will reach 3.4 million barrels daily by end-September despite Trump-era sanctions on the Islamic Republic remaining in place, without much enforcement by the Biden administration.Reuters reports that Iran has already ramped up crude exports this year, with May’s outflow hitting a 4-1/2 year high of 1.54M barrels per day, certified by Kpler data. Iran’s production climbed to 3M barrels a day in July, reaching a 2018 high, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil up but ends week down again as Powell signals more U.S. rate hikesDraft environmental study on Dakota Access pipeline expected in fall - US Army CorpsQatar does not see its relationship with China damaging the US -PM]"

Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Storms with frequent lightning, heavy rains and strong winds exceeding 70 mph in Ohio and 60 mph in western Pennsylvania swept into the area in the early morning hours today. The storms followed significant rain Wednesday night that totaled more than 4 inches in some areas, causing flooding, saturating the ground and increasing the probability for trees to fall from heavy winds. Hardest hit areas include Cuyahoga, Lake and Geauga counties in The Illuminating Company's service territory; Columbiana, Mahoning, Portage, Summit and Trumbull counties in Ohio Edison's service territory; and Allegheny, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties in West Penn Power's service territory.The tree- and flood-related damage is widespread, consisting of hundreds of broken poles and crossarms, downed power lines, and fallen trees and debris blocking road access. Our primary focus at this stage is to remove any hazards and assess the damage so that our crews can access the site of an outage and begin to safely make the repairs. Due to the extent of damage, restoration work is expected to continue into the weekend in the hardest hit areas.All internal line crews, hazard responders, forestry crews, contractors, safety and other support personnel are involved in storm response, and significant additional outside resources are enroute and being deployed to assist with the restoration effort. Though downed trees, localized flooding and road closures can slow progress, crews will continue to work around the clock to safely make repairs and ensure service to all customers has been restored.Current outage updates as of 10 a.m. today for the company's most impacted utilities include:Story continuesThe Illuminating Company: Approximately 155,000 customers in northeast Ohio lost power due to the storms, and 110,600 customers remain without service.

Software is ubiquitous and has become the focal point of technological innovation. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage has been extended to managing infrastructure. The industry is primarily gaining from the ongoing cloud transition. The role of software is constantly evolving.With the continuation of remote work setup and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, the demand for voice and video communication and productivity software is expected to increase exponentially. These trends bode well for industry participants like Adobe, Salesforce and Synopsys.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer Software industry includes companies that provide software applications related to cloud computing, electronic design automation (primarily for semiconductor and electronics industries), digital media and marketing, customer relationship management, on-premises and cloud-based database management, accounting and tax purposes, human capital management, cybersecurity and application performance monitoring and cloud-based enterprise communications platform.Some companies develop and market simulation software (like computer-aided design or CAD, 3D modeling, product lifecycle management or PLM, data orchestration and experience creation), which engineers, designers and researchers use across various industries like architecture, engineering and construction, product design, manufacturing and digital media.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Software IndustryHigher Spending on Software Aids Prospects: The industry's prospects are bright, given higher spending by enterprises on software procurement. Continued investment in big data and analytics and the ongoing adoption of software as a service or SaaS opens up opportunities for industry players. Cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform for developing and testing applications. The deployment time is also shorter compared with legacy systems. SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth on a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate.Story continuesCloud Computing Adoption Gaining Traction: The increasing need to secure cloud platforms amid growing cyber-attacks and hacking incidents drives demand for cyber security software. Enterprises are focused on rapid migration to the cloud and DevOps technologies to achieve scalability and agility for software development and IT operations. This helps deliver a flawless digital experience to clients. This trend has brought immense value to application and infrastructure performance monitoring. It is driving the demand for performance management monitoring tools that are scalable and suitable for cloud-based environments.Macroeconomic Headwinds a Concern: The mainstream adoption of the distributed workforce model is fueling demand for enterprise communication, workspace management and human capital management software solutions.

The company’s latest quarterly performance reflected record revenues across its datacenter end market, which mainly benefited from growing investments in generative AI.The company’s second-quarter performance reflected the continued strength of its Datacenter business on the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies also aided the segment’s top-line growth in the second quarter.However, the Datacenter end-market business mostly benefited from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the company’s revenues from the Datacenter business jumped 171% year over year and 141% sequentially, mainly due to growing investments in generative AI.NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteThough AI has been around for years, the meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has captivated the world’s attention on the power of generative AI to augment human capability, suggesting that the AI boom may just get started.The adoption of ChatGPT among enterprises has already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy &amp; utilities and video game development.However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.Story continuesNVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power are being considered as the top choice for enterprises. NVIDIA’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models, which is expanding its footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. NVIDIA expects its third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $16 billion (+/- 2%) from $5.93 billion in the year-ago quarter, largely driven by surging AI investments across the datacenter end market.The proven success of generative AI has sparked competition among software makers, including Salesforce CRM, Cisco CSCO and Adobe ADBE, to integrate the technology into their products.Salesforce forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. In June 2023, the company elevated the set of its generative AI tools with the launch of the AI Cloud service. With this, CRM claims to offer one-stop AI-powered solutions for enterprises looking to enhance productivity.Salesforce’s AI Cloud is a suite of services that delivers enterprise-ready real-time, open and secure generative experiences across all applications and workflows. The suite will power new capabilities across Salesforce’s products, including Einstein service, data analysis software Tableau and workplace-messaging app, Slack.Cisco’s AI and machine learning offerings encompass a wide range of computing solutions for enterprises, including a focus on cybersecurity. The company plans to enhance customer experience solutions, devices and its video conferencing platform, Webex Suite, with ML technologies, automation and generative AI features, from meeting summaries to visual enhancements.The digital media solutions provider, Adobe, aggressively expanded its footprint in the generative AI space through partnerships and new solutions. Adobe has unveiled a family of generative AI models, Firefly, focused on the generation of texts and images. Per the company, Firefly will offer more precision, speed, power and ease in content creation. It will let users of various experience levels create high-quality images and stunning text effects.At present, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Adobe and Salesforce each carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

FLS and Graham Corp. GHM.Industry: Industrial ManufacturingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2140158/4-top-stocks-from-the-promising-industrial-manufacturing-industryWhile the manufacturing sector remains in the contraction territory, signs of gradual improvement augur well for the Zacks Manufacturing – General Industrial industry. Improving supply chains and reduced delivery lead times are expected to drive the industry's growth in the near term. Focus on inorganic activities and investments in product upgrades and innovation are expected to bolster the industry's growth.Companies like Ingersoll Rand, RBC Bearings, Flowserve Corp. and Graham Corp. are well-placed to capitalize on the buoyancy in the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing – General Industrial industry comprises companies engaged in the production of a wide range of industrial equipment. Some industry players offer power transmission products, bearings, engineered fluid power components and systems, industrial rubber products, vapor-abrasive blasting equipment, vehicle-powered truck refrigeration systems, adhesive, gel coat equipment, flow-control components and linear motion components.In addition, industrial manufacturing companies reconstruct and assemble pumps, valves, speed reducers and hydraulic motors. The companies provide services to original equipment manufacturing, and maintenance, repair and overhaul customers. These end users belong to the mining, oil and gas, forest products, agriculture and food processing, fabricated metals, chemicals and petrochemicals, transportation and utilities industries.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing General Industrial IndustryPersistent Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Continued weakness in the manufacturing sector signals a low-demand environment for the industry players. Per the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, in July, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager's Index) touched 46.4%, contracting for the ninth consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity.Story continuesThe New Orders Index has remained in contraction territory for the past several quarters, registering 47.3% in July. While the manufacturing sector remains weak, it is contracting at a slower pace. In July, the Manufacturing PMI increased 0.4 percentage points from the June figure, while new orders rose 1.7 percentage points. Signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector are a boon for the industry.Easing Supply Chain Disruptions: While supply-chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved, as evident from the ISM report's Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the tenth straight month in July. Easing supply chain issues should support industrial manufacturing companies' growth in 2023.Acquisition-Based Growth Strategy: The industry participants focus on an acquisition-based growth strategy to expand their network and product offerings. This helps them foray into new markets and solidify their competitive position. Exposure to various end markets help industrial manufacturing companies offset risks associated with a single market. Continuous investments in product development and innovation, automation and technological advancements augur well for the industry's growth.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Manufacturing – General Industrial industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #64. This rank places it in the top 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

Escalated SG&amp;A expenses are also hurting many companies in the space. In addition, reduced discretionary spending due to an overall inflationary landscape has been a concern.  Nevertheless, brand enhancement techniques, including innovations along with efforts to enhance store and digital operations keep lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Crocs, Inc. CROX, Guess?, Inc. GES and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII well-positioned.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile - Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear. The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running and training, to name a few. Some companies also deal with fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryEscalated Costs: Players in the Textile-apparel space are encountering escalated input cost inflation, persistently weighing on their profits. Companies continue to battle supply-chain hurdles stemming from port congestions, increasing freight prices and wide-scale shortages of materials. Textile-apparel players have been witnessing higher SG&amp;A costs as well. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations have spiked SG&amp;A costs. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins. Moreover, the impact of lower demand due to inflation, rising interest rates and reduced discretionary spending is a significant concern for the payers.International Exposure Poses Risks: Due to a vast international presence, the same company  es are exposed to volatile foreign currency movements. Political unrest, like turmoil related to the current geopolitical events and related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could also dent companies’ performance.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts and alliances will likely keep supporting textile-apparel players. New product launches are also an essential part of their growth. These companies regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience.

53,35bed9d9-6589-364c-993c-826c9a56bdbf,PCG,2023-08-26,Bare electrical wire and poles in need of replacement on Maui were little match for strong winds,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bare-electrical-wire-poles-replacement-120410324.html,1693051450,STORY,"['HE', 'PCG']","[In the first moments of the Maui fires, when high winds brought down power poles, slapping electrified wires to the dry grass below, there was a reason the flames erupted all at once in long, neat rows -- those wires were bare, uninsulated metal that could spark on contact.Videos and images analyzed by The Associated Press confirmed those wires were among miles of line that Hawaiian Electric Co. left naked to the weather and often-thick foliage, despite a recent push by utilities in other wildfire- and hurricane-prone areas to cover up their lines or bury them.Compounding the problem is that many of the utility’s 60,000, mostly wooden power poles, which its own documents described as built to “an obsolete 1960s standard,” were leaning and near the end of their projected lifespan. They were nowhere close to meeting a 2002 national standard that key components of Hawaii’s electrical grid be able to withstand 105 mile per hour winds.A 2019 filing said it had fallen behind in replacing the old wooden poles because of other priorities and warned of a “serious public hazard” if they “failed.”Google street view images of poles taken before the fire show the bare wire.It’s “very unlikely” a fully-insulated cable would have sparked and caused a fire in dry vegetation, said Michael Ahern, who retired this month as director of power systems at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.Experts who watched videos showing downed power lines agreed wire that was insulated would not have arced and sparked, igniting a line of flame.Hawaiian Electric said in a statement that it has “long recognized the unique threats"" from climate change and has spent millions of dollars in response, but did not say whether specific power lines that collapsed in the early moments of the fire were bare.“We've been executing on a resilience strategy to meet these challenges, and since 2018, we have spent approximately $950 million to strengthen and harden our grid and approximately $110 million on vegetation management efforts,” the company said. “This work included replacing more than 12,500 poles and structures since 2018 and trimming and removing trees along approximately 2,500 line miles every year on average.”Story continuesBut a former member of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission confirmed many of Maui's wooden power poles were in poor condition. Jennifer Potter lives in Lahaina and until the end of last year was on the commission, which regulates Hawaiian Electric.“Even tourists that drive around the island are like, ‘What is that?’ They’re leaning quite significantly because the winds over time literally just pushed them over,” she said. “That obviously is not going to withstand 60, 70 mile per hour winds. So the infrastructure was just not strong enough for this kind of windstorm … The infrastructure itself is just compromised.”John Morgan, a personal injury and trial attorney in Florida who lives part-time in Maui noticed the same thing. “I could look at the power poles. They were skinny, bending, bowing. The power went out all the time.”Morgan’s firm is suing Hawaiian Electric on behalf of one person and talking to many more about their rights. The fire came within 500 yards of house.Sixty percent of the utility poles on West Maui were still down on Aug. 14, according to Hawaiian Electric CEO Shelee Kimura at a media conference — 450 of the 750 poles.Hawaiian Electric is facing a spate of new lawsuits that seek to hold it responsible for the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. The number of confirmed dead stands at 115, and the county expects that to rise.Lawyers plan to inspect some electrical equipment from a neighborhood where the fire is thought to have originated as soon as next week, per a court order, but they will be doing that in a warehouse. The utility took down the burnt poles and removed fallen wires from the site.This was a “preventable tragedy of epic proportions,” said attorney Paul Starita, lead counsel on three of the lawsuits.“It all comes back to money,” said Starita, of the California firm Singleton Schreiber. “They might say, oh, well, it takes a long time to get the permitting process done or whatever. OK, start sooner. I mean, people’s lives are on the line. You’re responsible. Spend the money, do your job.”Hawaiian Electric also faces criticism for not shutting off the power amid high wind warnings and keeping it on even as dozens of poles began to topple. Maui County sued Hawaiian Electric on Thursday over this issue.Michael Jacobs, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that with power lines causing so many fires in the United States: “We definitely have a new pattern, we just don’t have a new safety regime to go with it.”Insulating an electrical wire prevents arcing and sparking, and dissipates heat.Other utilities have been addressing the issue of bare wire. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric was found responsible for the 2018 Camp Fire in northern California that killed 85 people. The disaster was caused by downed power lines.Its program to eliminate uninsulated wire in fire zones has covered more than 1,200 miles of line so far.PG&amp;E also announced in 2021 it would bury 10,000 miles of electrical line. It buried 180 miles in 2022 and is on pace to do 350 miles this year.Another major California utility, Southern California Edison, expects to have replaced more than 7,200 miles, or about 75% of its overhead distribution lines, with covered wire in high fire risk areas by the end of 2025. It, too, is burying line in areas at severe risk.Hawaiian Electric said in a filing last year that it had looked to the wildfire plans of utilities in California.Some don’t fault Hawaiian Electric for its comparative lack of action because it has not faced the threat of wildfires for as long. And the utility is not at all alone in continuing to use bare metal conductors high up on power poles.The same is true for public safety power shutoffs. It's been only a few years that utilities have been willing to preemptively shut off people's power to prevent fire and the disruptive practice is not yet widespread.But Mark Toney called wildfires caused by utilities absolutely preventable. He is executive director of the ratepayer group The Utility Reform Network in California. It is pushing PG&amp;E to insulate its lines in high-risk areas.“We have to stop utility-caused wildfires. We have to stop them and the quickest, cheapest way to do it is to insulate the overhead lines,” he said.As for the poles, in a 2019 Hawaiian Electric regulatory document, the company said its 60,000 poles, nearly all wood, were vulnerable because they were already old and Hawaii is in a “severe wood decay hazard zone.” The company said it had fallen behind in replacing wood poles because of other priorities and warned of a “serious public hazard” if the poles “failed.”The document said many of the company’s poles were built to withstand 56 mph (90 kph), when a Category 1 Hurricane has winds of at least 74 mph.In 2002, the National Electric Safety Code was updated to require utility poles like those on Maui to withstand 105 mile per hour winds.The U.S. electrical grid was designed and built for last century’s climate, said Joshua Rhodes, an energy systems research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. Utilities would be smart to better prepare for protracted droughts and high winds, he added.“Everyone considers Hawaii to be a tropical paradise, but it got dry and it burned,” he said Thursday. “It may look expensive if you’re doing work to stave off starting wildfires or the impact of wildfires, but it’s much cheaper than actually starting one and burning down so many people’s homes and causing so many people’s deaths.”Tony Takitani, an attorney born and raised on Maui, is working with Morgan on the litigation.Takitani said in his 68 years there, it’s getting drier and drier. He said what happened on the island is so horrific it’s hard to talk about. But he does think it will force improvements to the grid.“When the poles go down, it’s kindling,” he said. “The combination of what’s going on with our Earth and people not being properly prepared for it, I think caused this. From living here, from the videos I’ve seen of poles going down and fires igniting, it seems kind of obvious.”___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

54,0087fbb3-4594-3fca-85cd-5d3537c1804e,PCG,2023-08-26,PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) Shares Could Be 27% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-corporation-nyse-pcg-153834384.html,1692977914,STORY,['PCG'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, PG&amp;E fair value estimate is US$22.97PG&amp;E's US$16.71 share price signals that it might be 27% undervalued Analyst price target for PCG is US$19.12 which is 17% below our fair value estimateIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for PG&amp;E The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$1.92b-US$2.34b-US$1.88bUS$1.10bUS$1.51bUS$1.92bUS$2.29bUS$2.62bUS$2.89bUS$3.13bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 37.47%Est @ 26.88%Est @ 19.46%Est @ 14.27%Est @ 10.63%Est @ 8.09% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% -US$1.8k-US$2.1k-US$1.6kUS$860US$1.1kUS$1.3kUS$1.5kUS$1.6kUS$1.7kUS$1.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.3bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.2%) = US$77bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$77b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$42bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$46b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$16.7, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PG&amp;E as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.834. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PG&amp;EStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Yahoo Finance Tech Reporter Dan Howley explains that adjustments range from taking responsibility for illegal goods bought and sold on their platform to restrictions on marketing toward teens. Howley notes the range of companies impacted by this legislation, saying “any big tech company that you can think of is involved with this.""Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Meantime, major tech companies are bracing for the impact due to be brought on from the EU Digital Services Act. Here to break down how this could change the online market space is Yahoo Finance's own Dan Howley. Dan, take it away.DAN HOWLEY: That's right, Dan-- Diane, the Digital Services Act is going into effect today. Probably already in effect in Europe, obviously, with that time change. But what we want to talk about is some of the changes that are coming to companies or companies are going to have to begin putting into place as a result of this. And some have already been working on these changes before working with the EU to ensure that they're complying with these rules, which they must comply with or face stiff penalties.So we'll just go over some of them real quick. We have-- they have to have measures in place to counter illegal goods and services that are sold through their platforms, whether that's on Amazon or Meta's marketplace-- Meta's Facebook Marketplace. They have to provide traceability of business users.So if there are counterfeit goods, for instance-- we've heard about that being an issue on online marketplaces-- these companies now, the online platforms have to provide a way to trace these businesses to ensure that those illegal goods are then taken down. They also have to have transparency measures put into place. They have to provide researchers with access to their data.They have to be transparent about the types of algorithms they have. And they also are no longer able to market towards teens based on some of their existing profile information. Basically, just the fact that they're teens is the only thing they can use.You can also now-- and, again, this is all in the EU-- opt out of algorithms. So you don't need to use algorithmically-driven versions of websites, whether that's Meta, Instagram, X, what have you. You can just see a chronological order of people that you know rather than an algorithmically-driven version that's meant to get you to want to engage more with unknown users and have you spend more time online. They're also supposed to stop using so-called dark patterns, which are basically a means of designing a product to get people to want to use it, perhaps sign up for a service, or buy something that they otherwise wouldn't do if those dark patterns didn't exist.So this is all something that the EU is forcing companies to comply with. If they don't, again, they'll face stiff penalties, the worst of which would be perhaps being kicked out of the EU altogether, though you can imagine the companies won't want to go that far. Amazon is already trying to challenge the rules on its own, saying it doesn't belong in a certain category of them. But any big tech company that you can think of is involved in this-- Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, X, the entire like. So if you're a big tech firm, you're paying close attention today.]"

The company's market cap as of Friday stood at $41 million, Yahoo Finance data showed.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Rite Aid said: ""We have closed 239 stores since 2021. Like all retail businesses, we regularly review each of our locations to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers, communities and the overall business.""In 2022, the company closed a planned 145 stores, with more expected this year. In the latest quarter ended June 3, Rite Aid closed 27 stores. As of June 3, it operated 2,284 pharmacy locations.The preparations come after the company was sued by the US government in April over its failure to detect what the Department of Justice called ""red flags"" around its filling of prescriptions for opioids and other painkillers.A bankruptcy filing would list those opioid claimants as unsecured claimants, according to the Journal. Additionally, the bankruptcy could help Rite Aid reject lease payments at stores it plans to close, a common tactic used in retail bankruptcy to limit costs. The Journal also noted Friday the company is facing over a thousand federal lawsuits that were consolidated in Ohio.The Rite Aid logo is displayed outside a Ride Aid store on December 21, 2022 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)In April, Rite Aid's interim CEO, Elizabeth Burr, said on the company's earnings conference call in response to a question about opioid litigation, ""I think it's very difficult, as you can imagine, to predict litigation. And all we can tell you is that what we're facing is very consistent with everybody else in the industry is facing.""Story continuesIn its annual report filed in May, Rite Aid said, ""Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures through at least the next twelve months, the costs associated with these legal proceedings are impossible to estimate with certainty, could exceed any applicable insurance coverage, and could significantly impact such liquidity.""Revenue in Rite Aid's most recent quarter, the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, fell about 7% to $5.65 billion.

PAYX boasts a robust position in the outsourcing market, driven by strong revenue growth. The company is actively pursuing opportunities in the professional employer organization sector. Its steadfast dividend payouts and share buybacks enhance investor confidence and positively influence earnings per share.PAYX has gained 4.5% year to date compared with the outsourcing market industry’s 7% rise.Paychex, Inc. PricePaychex, Inc. PricePaychex, Inc. price | Paychex, Inc. QuoteFactors in FavorAs of May 31,2023, Paychex served more than 730,000 payroll clients. The company has been reporting its revenues broadly under two categories, which are service revenues and interest on funds held for clients. Service revenues contributed 98% to total revenues in fiscal 2023. 76% of the service revenues were from Management Solutions while 24% were from professional employer organization (PEO) and insurance services. Interest on funds held for clients accounted for the remaining 2% of fiscal 2023 revenues.Revenue growth is crucial for a company since it drives growth plans and justifies expenses. Paychex has achieved revenue growth through its services, tech, and acquisitions, with an 8.2% five-year CAGR from 2018 to 2023, enhancing margins, and ensuring long-term profitability. Management Solutions revenues are expected to indicate year-over-year growth of 5.5% in 2024 while revenues from PEO and Insurance Solutions are expected to grow 6.2% from the year-ago reported quarter. We expect total revenues to be $5.32 billion, up 6.3% from the year-ago figure.Paychex consistently focuses on benefiting its shareholders by distributing dividends and conducting share buybacks. In fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the company allocated $1.17 billion, $999.6 million, and $908.7 million for dividends and invested $145.2 million, $155.7 million, and $171.9 million in share repurchases, respectively. The company did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2023. These actions bolster investor trust and have a favorable influence on earnings per share.Story continuesPaychex’s current ratio was 1.30 at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, higher than the 1.25 at the end of the prior-year quarter. A current ratio of more than 1 implies that the company has enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities.Factors AgainstPaychex's expenses are climbing due to investments in various areas and PEO insurance costs. Strategic acquisitions also contribute to the expenses. In 2023, expenses reached $2.97 billion, up 7% year over year, following similar trends in previous years. This may continue to strain the company's bottom line.The outsourcing sector relies heavily on foreign talent and is labor intensive. Increasing competition for talent and strict immigration policies may hinder industry growth, impacting companies like Paychex.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPAYX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in Zacks Business Services sector can consider the following stocks:Aptiv APTV holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Software is ubiquitous and has become the focal point of technological innovation. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage has been extended to managing infrastructure. The industry is primarily gaining from the ongoing cloud transition. The role of software is constantly evolving.With the continuation of remote work setup and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, the demand for voice and video communication and productivity software is expected to increase exponentially. These trends bode well for industry participants like Adobe, Salesforce and Synopsys.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer Software industry includes companies that provide software applications related to cloud computing, electronic design automation (primarily for semiconductor and electronics industries), digital media and marketing, customer relationship management, on-premises and cloud-based database management, accounting and tax purposes, human capital management, cybersecurity and application performance monitoring and cloud-based enterprise communications platform.Some companies develop and market simulation software (like computer-aided design or CAD, 3D modeling, product lifecycle management or PLM, data orchestration and experience creation), which engineers, designers and researchers use across various industries like architecture, engineering and construction, product design, manufacturing and digital media.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Software IndustryHigher Spending on Software Aids Prospects: The industry's prospects are bright, given higher spending by enterprises on software procurement. Continued investment in big data and analytics and the ongoing adoption of software as a service or SaaS opens up opportunities for industry players. Cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform for developing and testing applications. The deployment time is also shorter compared with legacy systems. SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth on a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate.Story continuesCloud Computing Adoption Gaining Traction: The increasing need to secure cloud platforms amid growing cyber-attacks and hacking incidents drives demand for cyber security software. Enterprises are focused on rapid migration to the cloud and DevOps technologies to achieve scalability and agility for software development and IT operations. This helps deliver a flawless digital experience to clients. This trend has brought immense value to application and infrastructure performance monitoring. It is driving the demand for performance management monitoring tools that are scalable and suitable for cloud-based environments.Macroeconomic Headwinds a Concern: The mainstream adoption of the distributed workforce model is fueling demand for enterprise communication, workspace management and human capital management software solutions. However, global macroeconomic weakness, prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and volatile supply chain dynamics are concerns.

The uncertainty in business visibility could dent the industry's performance in the near term.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Software industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology sector.

Hayley Berg, Hopper Lead Economist, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the state of the economy, holiday travel, and how consumers can get the best deals.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, millions of people are expected to travel for Labor Day weekend next week. And a new report shows you may be getting a cheaper deal. Though hotel prices in the US have risen slightly from last year, airfare and rental car costs are both down over 10% from 2022. That's according to a new report from Hopper.And Hayley Berg, Hopper lead economist, is joining us now to talk through it. So we obviously have seen some moderating prices across the economy. I got to say, I was a little surprised by the moderating prices in airfares in particular because, A, we know there's still a lot of demand. And B, anecdotally, it doesn't feel like those prices have come down. So where is that pressure sort of letting up?HAYLEY BERG: We hear that so often. We're quoting these low prices. But consumers don't feel like they're seeing them. And part of that is some behavioral changes. People are planning trips much more last minute than they did prepandemic, meaning they're missing out on some of the best and lowest prices.But domestic prices are really down driven by the higher supply the airlines are operating at the end of the summer this year, a much earlier peak in summer demand. We saw the majority of folks taking trips in June, July, and early August.So we've entered that low-demand period about a week or two earlier than we have in previous years. All of that is gonna drive airfare down for Labor Day weekend in particular, comes at the end of the summer. It's not always the highest demand long weekend of the summer. And that's really why we're seeing about 225 for airfare down about $75 from what we saw earlier this summer and 4th of July weekend.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: It's really interesting. And as we think about travelers getting ready to perhaps make those flights, catch them, some of them might miss them. That's unfortunate. At the same time, the airlines, are they better equipped now at the end of the summer to really deal with the influx, the volume of demand that they're gonna see?HAYLEY BERG: I would say airlines every day since really the end of 2021 have been increasingly better equipped, better trained to handle the volume of passengers that we're seeing. There was a huge influx of new hiring in 2022. Those people had to be trained. And it's not just the airlines, it's the airports as well. It's the FAA, air traffic control, TSA.So we had a relatively successful summer. We did not see the incredibly high disruption rates we did in 2022. But it is a fact that disruption rates are higher now than they have been. You know, prepandemic, about 25% of flights delayed on departure, between 1% and 2% canceled. That still impacts thousands of passengers a day.JULIE HYMAN: Does it dissuade them from traveling, though, Hayley? I mean, and I take that also with the report that recently came out, I believe, in ""The New York Times"" talking about how many near misses there are because of our air traffic control system. Do we see any kind of hit to travelers sentiment as a result of all of this?HAYLEY BERG: We haven't seen it on the Hopper app. Most of our users are Gen Z, millennials, so they definitely are more focused on travel than some of the older generations have historically been. The most interesting thing we're seeing, though, is that about one in five of our users are paying extra, a little more than $30 additional to buy a disruption protection product when they check out with their flight.That's something that allows them to rebook for free on the next available flight if they're canceled, delayed, or miss a connection. And that right there shows us that though travelers are price conscious-- they continue to check the price of trips many times before they book-- they are prepared to pay a little extra for peace of mind in case they are canceled or have a major disruption in their trip.BRAD SMITH: Are people upgrading? And beyond just buying protection, are they upgrading their experience even after that initial purchase?HAYLEY BERG: We always see travelers upgrading, whether it is selecting seats, moving to a higher cabin class. That's something that's been persistent even since prepandemic. If anything, we've seen the airlines start to make some strategic changes to capture more of this premium demand, expanding their premium, seat selection spaces, in some cases, even removing first class to expand business or premium. So there is definitely a lot of demand for premium out there. But when we poll our users, getting the best price and getting an affordable trip remains their number one priority even ahead of anything like more legroom.]"

Shares have lost about 3.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Western Union due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Western Union Q2 Earnings Beat on High C2C TransactionsWestern Union reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 51 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 34.2%. The bottom line remained flat year over year.Total revenues rose 3% year over year on a reported basis or 6% on a constant-currency basis to $1,170 million. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.8%.The quarterly results were supported by growth in business originating from Iraq, Argentinian inflation and better-than-expected C2C transactions. Evolve 2025’s momentum and strength in the Middle East business further benefited the results, partially offset by higher expenses.Q2 PerformanceAdjusted operating margin of 21.8% deteriorated 150 basis points year over year due to increased incentive compensation, variable costs, currency impacts and investments in Evolve 2025 strategy. However, the adjusted operating margin beat our estimate of 18.4% as the negatives were partially offset by reduced marketing spend and savings from the redeployment program of operating expenses.Second-quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16% was lower than 16.9% in the year-ago period.Western Union’s total expenses came in at $927.4 million, up 6% year over year and 8.9% higher than our estimate. Higher cost of services and SG&amp;A expenses contributed to this increase in the second quarter.C2C SegmentThe C2C segment reported revenues of $1,072.2 million, which increased 4% year over year and beat our estimate of $950.4 million in the quarter under review, on the back of higher transactions. Operating income climbed 2% year over year to $230.7 million, beating our estimate of $158.4 million. Changes in Iraqi monetary policies also provided an impetus. The operating income margin of 21.5% fell from 22% a year ago.Story continuesTransactions within the C2C segment rose 4% year over year to 70.6 million, marking the highest growth since 2021 and beating our estimate of 63.5 million, on the back of its branded digital go-to-market program strength. Furthermore, higher transactions across the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, Latin American and Caribbean region and North America boosted the metric in the second quarter, partially offset by lower Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States transactions.Branded Digital revenues decreased 2% on a reported basis and constant-currency basis. Its transactions, however, increased 12% year over year.Business SolutionsThe Business Solutions segment reported revenues of $14.3 million, which plunged 60% year over year. Operating income of $1.8 million fell 79% year over year. The operating income margin was 12.1% in the second quarter, down from 23.5% a year ago.The company completed the divestment (third closing) of the Business Solutions unit on Jul 1, 2023. In this final stage, the European Union operations of the unit were included.Balance Sheet (as of Jun 30, 2023)Western Union exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,585.9 million, which increased from the 2022-end level of $1,285.9 million. Total assets of $8,487.4 million marginally declined from the $8,496.3 million figure at 2022-end.Borrowings increased from $2,616.8 million at 2022-end to $2,813 million. Total debt outstanding at the second-quarter end was $2.81 billion.Total stockholders' equity of $626.5 million increased from $477.8 million as of Dec 31, 2022.In the first half of 2023, net cash provided by operating activities decreased from $306.8 million a year ago to $264 million.Dividend UpdateWestern Union rewarded its shareholders with $88 million in dividends in the second quarter.2023 GuidanceThe company raised its guidance for 2023 thanks to better performance in Iraq. However, the upside is not expected to last going forward due to the recent actions of the U.S. government, barring 14 Iraqi banks from dollar transactions.Western Union now expects adjusted revenues to be within a decline of 1% and an increase of 1% in 2023 compared with the 2022 level of $4,444.6 million.Adjusted EPS is anticipated within $1.65-$1.75 for 2023. The midpoint of the guidance indicates a decline from the 2022 reported figure of $1.76 per share. Adjusted operating margin is expected between 19% and 21%. The metric stood at 20.4% in 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Western Union has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookWestern Union has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerWestern Union belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, Visa (V), has gained 2.2% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended June 2023.Visa reported revenues of $8.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.7%. EPS of $2.16 for the same period compares with $1.98 a year ago.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7%.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa.

70,2b10bd6e-80ff-3b18-a4ce-b639f27f0df0,PPG,2023-08-26,3 Basic Materials Stocks to Buy for Sound Growth & Value,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-basic-materials-stocks-buy-232400726.html,1693005840,STORY,"['PPG', 'NUE']","[The defensive hedge many basic materials stocks provided amid high inflation has become more and more of a distant memory.Higher commodity prices led to immense profitability with Nucor NUE as an example thriving as a leading steel producer. Naturally, investors have to monitor the premium they are paying for Nucor’s stock among others as the high-inflationary boost starts to settle.    However, there are still some intruing options among the basic materials sector as it relates to growth and value. Here are three top-rated stocks that stand out in particular. Hawkins HWKNWith an essential niche as a chemical products provider, Hawkins stock is very attractive right now and covets a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).As a brief overview, thousands of water treatment facilities, manufacturers, food and dairy producers, and research labs among other organizations depend on Hawkins for chemical products.Considering its broad reach to a variety of end markets, Hawkins stock certainly holds a lot of value to investors. Earnings are expected to pop 19% in Hawkins’ current fiscal 2024 to $3.40 per share compared to $2.86 a share in FY23. Even better, this would represent 155% EPS growth over the last five years with 2020 earnings at $1.33 a share.Hawkins stock has soared 52% this year to outperform the broader indexes and the Zacks Chemical-Specialty Markets +20%. With that being said, Hawkins's stock still trades reasonably at 16.9X forward earnings which is near its industry average of 14.8X and nicely beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 20.4X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG Industries PPGNext up, PPG Industries stock remains attractive and lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). While PPG stock is up a modest but respectable +10% this year there should be more room to run.Earnings estimates remain higher, and the chemical coats, paints, and glass provider is expecting expansive bottom-line growth. PPG’s earnings are now forecasted to climb 24% in FY23 to $7.51 per share compared to EPS of $6.05 last year. Notably, FY24 earnings are expected to jump another 10%.Story continuesAt 18.2X forward earnings, investors aren’t paying a stretched premium for PPG’s attractive growth. PPG trades modestly above the Chemical-Specialty Industry average of 14.8X but below the benchmark. Taking a closer look, PPG’s price-to-earnings valuation combined with the company’s growth rate is very compelling for investors.This is indicated in the company’s PEG ratio which is near the optimum level of less than 1. With a PEG of 1.03, PPG’s stock looks like a very sound investment for value and growth as this is below the industry average of 1.88 and the benchmark's 1.71. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLivent LTHMRounding out the list, now may be a good time to buy Livent’s stock which also sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Livent is a producer of lithium chemicals for the application in batteries which will be essential to the continued expansion of electric vehicles.Livent’s lithium chemicals are also used for agrochemicals, aerospace, alloys, pharmaceuticals, and various industrial applications. Livent stock is up +8% YTD but is still near its 52-week lows at around $21 a share.With much of the risk-to-reward appearing to be priced in, it’s noteworthy that Livent’s FY23 earnings are projected to soar 53% to $2.15 per share. More intriguing, FY24 earnings are forecasted to climb another 20% to $2.57 per share.This will be accompanied by double-digit top-line growth as well. Total sales are expected to soar 33% this year and leap another 28% in FY24 to $1.39 billion. Livent appears to be vastly undervalued considering the company’s growth potential. To that point, Livent stock trades at 10.2X forward earnings which is a nice discount to the Chemical-Specialty Industry average and the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line These basic materials stocks make a strong case for being undervalued considering their importance to a variety of end markets. They appear to offer good value to investors at their current levels making now a good time to buy with Hawkins, PPG Industries, and Livent expecting stellar growth and shaping up to be viable investments for 2023 and beyond.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At the end of Jun 30, 2022, the company had 508 million ounces of silver and 6 million ounces of gold as its inferred mineral resources. The decrease in silver ounces is primarily owing to the removal of the inferred mineral resource for the Shahuindo sulfides following metallurgical test work.In the second quarter of 2023, Pan American Silver reported adjusted earnings per share of 4 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. PAAS had reported an adjusted loss per share of 3 cents in the year-ago quarter.Pan American Silver’s revenues surged 87.9% year over year to $640 million in the quarter under review, reflecting the expanded operating base after the Yamana transaction.

Shares have added about 0.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Mattel due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Mattel Q2 Earnings and Revenues Surpass EstimatesMattel reported second-quarter 2023 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the top and bottom lines declined on a year-over-year basis.Earnings &amp; Revenue DiscussionIn the quarter under review, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 10 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. In the year-ago quarter, it reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 18 cents.Net sales during the quarter amounted to $1,087.2 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $996 million. The top line decreased 12% year over year. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, sales declined 13% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. The dismal performance of the Barbie brand negatively impacted the company’s performance.In the North America segment, gross billings fell 18% (as reported and at cc) year over year. Gross billings in the International segment dipped 1% (on a reported basis) and 3% (at cc) year over year. The segment was affected by dismal performance of Action Figures, Building Sets, Games and Other (primarily Action Figures), Infant, Toddler and Preschool (including Fisher-Price), and Vehicles (including Hot Wheels), marginally overshadowed by growth in Dolls. Our model predicted North America and International gross billings to tumble 23.5% and 17.6% year over year, respectively.Net sales in the North America segment declined 18% year over year on a reported basis and at cc. The International segment’s net sales fell 3% (as reported) and 5% (at cc) year over year. Our model estimated North America and International revenues to decline 22.5% and 17.8% year over year, respectively.Story continuesBrand-Wise Worldwide SalesMattel, through its subsidiaries, sells a broad range of toys. These items are grouped under different brands — Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, Thomas &amp; Friends, and Other.Worldwide gross billings by Mattel Power Brands fell 11% (on a reported basis) and 12% (at cc) year over year to $1,227.5 million. The Barbie brand witnessed a decline of 6% (on a reported basis) and 7% (at cc) year over year.Gross billings at the Hot Wheels brand rose 10% (on a reported basis) and 9% (at cc) year over year. Gross billings at Fisher-Price were down 28% (on a reported basis) and 29% (at cc) year over year. Gross billings at Other decreased 17% (on a reported basis) and 18% (at cc) year over year.Operating ResultsDuring the second quarter, the company’s adjusted gross margin came in at 44.9%, flat year over year. Gross margin benefited from Optimizing for Growth program, foreign exchange favorability as well as lower severance and restructuring expenses. However, inventory management efforts including higher close-out sales and inventory obsolescence expense, cost inflation and an unfavorable fixed cost absorption negatively impacted the margin.During the quarter under discussion, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses declined $19 million year over year to $324 million. The downside was due to Optimizing for Growth program and cost management efforts.Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $299.9 million compared with $274.5 million as of Jun 30, 2022. Total inventories at the end of the second quarter came in at $971.6 million compared with $1,177.6 million reported in the prior year quarter.Long-term debt (as of Jun 30, 2023) was $2,327.8 million compared with $2,323.3 million as of Jun 30, 2022.

75,a2c01aa4-3fe6-3d27-b1b2-e7921446b9ba,MAT,2023-08-26,"Gap reports mixed Q2 with earnings beat, revenue miss",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/gap-reports-mixed-q2-earnings-141548099.html,1692972948.0,VIDEO,"['GPS', 'MAT']","[Gap (GPS) reported mixed Q2 earnings on Thursday. The company's new CEO Richard Dickson, former Mattel (MAT) executive, spoke about reigniting Gap's brands and the challenges ahead of the retail company. Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brad Smith break down the report.Video Transcript- Well, shares of Gap, we're watching them this morning. They're little changed, only up about 3/4 of 1% after reporting earnings after the bell on Thursday, Gap beating on earnings per share but reported a sales decline across all brands in the second quarter down 8% from the year prior to about 3 and 1/2 billion.In a call with analysts, CFO, Katrina O'Connell warned of a choppy consumer market, saying the company would be prudent in planning for the months ahead. The company anticipates a drop in revenue for the upcoming quarter with net sales decreasing in the low double digit percentage range.The company's new CEO, former Mattel executive Richard Dickson, he stepped into his new role just on Tuesday. He was on the call. He didn't have a lot of specifics to offer on the call but that makes sense considering he's only been in the job for about three days. But I think a lot of these numbers just show the challenge that is ahead of him. He talked about reigniting and reinvigorating Gap's brands, but how he's going to do that I think remains the question.- Yeah, and if there's anything that we can perhaps extrapolate from his time at Mattel and perhaps in next that are going to use the transitive property bring that over to Gap, you could see more collaborations. Of course, Gap had tried that. They tried that with Kanye West or Ye.That didn't necessarily work. You tried that with a few other kind of instances and for Gap as a whole, of course, you've got the different subsidiaries and Old Navy really has been the company that had put the team on its back for so long to the point where at one point, they were looking to spin off Old Navy into its own business.Story continuesAnd so now you look across some of these other brands. Banana Republic had a pretty good year to this point, at least as it seemed people were perhaps gearing up to get back into some of those in-person capacities, whether that be at work or at school. Athleta has also been interesting in tracking how they're competing with some of the other athleisure players.I believe we were just talking about it in our newsroom, and some of the fanfare was certainly permeating within there a few days ago but at the same time, you look across some of the results that came out in this quarter. Total company net sales, there was a foreign exchange headwind but including those factors, total company net sales would have been down by about 5%.Comp sales were down 6% in the quarter but they did say in spite of the sales declines, they're reporting that all four of their brands gained or maintained market share during the second quarter with particular strength in the women's category. So we'll see--- Yeah I thought that was interesting. And Katrina O'Connell, again, the CFO was also asked how things went, how things have gone over the past couple of months. Did she see any kind of improvement? And she did say there was some improvement on the conference call she talked about that, especially in gap and Old Navy. She said back to school is going OK also, so that's something that's perhaps a little bit more encouraging.And she also said she is watchful of the trend of student loan repayment, which she said would primarily affect customers of Old Navy. I think the question here is Old Navy in particular since it does target a lower income consumer, are those people just not buying? Because they're not trading-- what do you trade down to from an Old Navy, right?So I guess that is the question here. They're maybe not buying as much apparel in this environment. Something else that stood out to me from the call as Richard Dickson settles into his role, and by the way, he's not the only new person at the company. Remember, Athleta has a new head, a former executive from Alo, A-L-O, Alo.- A-L-O- Alo Yoga. Alo. Thank you, I always get that wrong. Chris Blakeslee is the new guy coming in there, but Dixon sort of emphasizing the size and scope of Gap. I mean, it's still a huge company. They have 90,000 employees at the company and they sell through $900 million units a year. So $900 million pieces of clothing or whatever it is that they're apparel and pieces that they're selling.- And it will be interesting to see what he does on the storefront side too. The company ended the quarter with 3456 store locations, you think about the changeover.- They've been shrinking it.- Yeah, they have. And you think about the annexation that this company has had to the mall and the prominence of the mall for the past 15, 20 years, if not more, and how many of us, growing up, had been able to walk into a Gap or a Banana Republic or one of their owned entities or an Old Navy within a mall experience.But now, that foot traffic is changing elsewhere and there is more of a mixed shift to go directly online for a lot of consumers at least to initiate their search or to get inspiration if some of those stores, you see that continue to shrink, where they might reposition other stores and perhaps even shrink sum of the square footage that they operate to, which is something that we've heard over the course of this earnings season even as we were listening to some of the results from company in Macy's as well, how they're looking for many of these mall annexed or mall known type of pillars for many years where they're going to look to some of those smaller locations to really make sure that they're still having that consumer touch point.Get in, feel the clothes, put them on, try it on, whatever, see if you like it, walk out with it, great. If not, then you can have another type of realm where you spend more into that digital and that direct to consumer as well.]"

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Schlumberger (SLB).Schlumberger currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.2% and 15.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SLBBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SLBCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Schlumberger here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Schlumberger, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is SLB a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Schlumberger, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.98.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Schlumberger.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PAYX boasts a robust position in the outsourcing market, driven by strong revenue growth. The company is actively pursuing opportunities in the professional employer organization sector.

PricePaychex, Inc. PricePaychex, Inc. price | Paychex, Inc. QuoteFactors in FavorAs of May 31,2023, Paychex served more than 730,000 payroll clients. The company has been reporting its revenues broadly under two categories, which are service revenues and interest on funds held for clients. Service revenues contributed 98% to total revenues in fiscal 2023. 76% of the service revenues were from Management Solutions while 24% were from professional employer organization (PEO) and insurance services. Interest on funds held for clients accounted for the remaining 2% of fiscal 2023 revenues.Revenue growth is crucial for a company since it drives growth plans and justifies expenses. Paychex has achieved revenue growth through its services, tech, and acquisitions, with an 8.2% five-year CAGR from 2018 to 2023, enhancing margins, and ensuring long-term profitability. Management Solutions revenues are expected to indicate year-over-year growth of 5.5% in 2024 while revenues from PEO and Insurance Solutions are expected to grow 6.2% from the year-ago reported quarter. We expect total revenues to be $5.32 billion, up 6.3% from the year-ago figure.Paychex consistently focuses on benefiting its shareholders by distributing dividends and conducting share buybacks. In fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the company allocated $1.17 billion, $999.6 million, and $908.7 million for dividends and invested $145.2 million, $155.7 million, and $171.9 million in share repurchases, respectively. The company did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2023. These actions bolster investor trust and have a favorable influence on earnings per share.Story continuesPaychex’s current ratio was 1.30 at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, higher than the 1.25 at the end of the prior-year quarter. A current ratio of more than 1 implies that the company has enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities.Factors AgainstPaychex's expenses are climbing due to investments in various areas and PEO insurance costs. Strategic acquisitions also contribute to the expenses. In 2023, expenses reached $2.97 billion, up 7% year over year, following similar trends in previous years. This may continue to strain the company's bottom line.The outsourcing sector relies heavily on foreign talent and is labor intensive.

82,c69e8bc9-3aaa-3a51-a688-fd993fd8c218,NTRS,2023-08-26,Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) Will Pay A Dividend Of $0.75,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-trust-nasdaq-ntrs-pay-144221727.html,1692974541,STORY,['NTRS'],"[Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS) will pay a dividend of $0.75 on the 1st of October. This means the annual payment is 4.0% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Northern Trust Northern Trust's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained.Northern Trust has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but Northern Trust's payout ratio of 54% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 41.3%. Analysts forecast the future payout ratio could be 41% over the same time horizon, which is a number we think the company can maintain.historic-dividendNorthern Trust Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.20 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $3.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.6% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. However, Northern Trust's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year.Our Thoughts On Northern Trust's DividendOverall, we think Northern Trust is a solid choice as a dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't raised this year. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from competition or inflation. Businesses can change though, and we think it would make sense to see what analysts are forecasting for the company. Is Northern Trust not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.The stock market is on track for a positive weekly performance as investors eagerly anticipate the upcoming speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole summit. All eyes are on this gathering of central bankers, as it holds significant implications for market trends. Both U.S. futures and European stocks showed modest gains on August 25, providing relief following the decline experienced on the previous day. Contracts linked to the S&amp;P 500 index have risen by 0.3%, indicating a potential rebound for the broader equities market. This increase comes as a welcome development after the recent dip. The Stoxx 600 index extended its first weekly gain in Europe in four weeks. A notable contributor to this positive movement is the boost provided by commodity shares. Notably, the prices of oil and iron ore have climbed, prompting a rise in commodity-related stocks. Investor attention is particularly focused on the commodity sector due to these price hikes, which positively impacts the overall market sentiment. The steady increase in oil and iron ore prices is influencing trading patterns and contributing to the upward trajectory of the Stoxx 600.As market participants await Powell's speech, which is expected to offer insights into the Federal Reserve's future policies and economic outlook, the current market dynamics continue to be influenced by various factors. These factors include the evolving commodity prices, overall investor sentiment, and the anticipation of potential shifts in central bank policies. In summary, the markets are experiencing upward momentum as traders eagerly await Powell's address at the Jackson Hole summit. The positive performance of commodity stocks, driven by increased oil and iron ore prices, contributes to the overall gains observed in both U.S. and European markets. This, in turn, is providing some relief after a recent decline, and investors are closely watching for any indications of future market trends that Powell's speech might provide.Story continuesAccording to Bloomberg, Federal Reserve officials indicate that interest rates might be nearing their peak levels, although there are differing opinions on how close this might be. The prevailing sentiment is that current interest rates are in a ""restrictive stance,"" as noted by the President of the Philadelphia Fed. This implies that rates have reached a level that could potentially slow down economic growth. While one official mentioned that the Federal Reserve could be approaching a point where they can maintain the current rates for a considerable period, Boston Fed President Susan Collins mentioned that there might still be a need for further incremental rate hikes. Collins shared her perspective during an interview with Yahoo! Finance on the sidelines of the Kansas City Fed's annual economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Collins noted that while there's a possibility of needing additional rate increases, she also emphasized that the Federal Reserve might be on the brink of a juncture where they could keep rates stable for an extended duration. This indicates that the central bank is closely assessing the economic landscape, trying to find the right balance between preventing excessive inflation and maintaining a conducive environment for economic growth. The differing viewpoints among these officials highlight the ongoing complexity in determining the optimal course of action for interest rates. The central challenge lies in gauging inflation trends and economic conditions accurately to make informed decisions about whether to continue raising rates, maintain them, or potentially lower them to stimulate economic activity. The discussions around interest rates and their potential trajectory reflect the intricate task that the Federal Reserve faces in managing monetary policy to support a healthy economy while keeping inflation in check. As the Federal Reserve gathers at the annual economic policy symposium, these deliberations have added significance, given their potential impact on financial markets, borrowing costs, and broader economic conditions.

Axios Media Deals Reporter Tim Baysinger joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what this means for the sports streaming landscape.As customers continue cutting the chord and moving to streaming services, ""it makes sense that sports is moving over"" as well, Baysinger says. ""In terms of how to figure out the future of ESPN, I mean, Disney has been very open that they are looking for some kind of strategic partner,"" Baysinger says. Baysinger explains that Disney has ""held talks with multiple different companies"" including the NBA, NFL, and MLB, ""so they’re clearly looking far and wide for someone to help them with this full-streaming version of ESPN.""Baysinger notes that ""a full-streaming version of ESPN is going to be easily the most expensive, you know, streaming service on the market."" ""Sports rights are not cheap, they’re only going to get more expensive"" and with ESPN’s sports deals, ""their costs are only going up,"" Baysinger says.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Amazon is reportedly in talks with Disney for a potential streaming partnership with ESPN. The information reporting that the two companies have discussed pricing for the service with Amazon exploring a minority stake in the sports network. So what does this all mean for the sports streaming landscape?Here to discuss, we've got Axios Media Deals Reporter Tim Baysinger. Tim, was this a surprise? It seems to make sense given the sports offerings Amazon already has.TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah, it's-- in some ways, it's not much of a surprise. Because, I mean, if you look at a lot of the recent reports and that in terms of how to figure out the future of ESPN, I mean, Disney has been very open that they are looking for some kind of strategic partner.They've held talks with multiple different companies. They've held talks with every single professional league, the NBA, the NFL, Major League Baseball, the NHL, obviously, Amazon. They've held talks with Verizon. So they're clearly looking far and wide for someone to help them with this full streaming version of ESPN.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: And, Tim, when you think about pricing especially we've seen some data recently about some of the churn that's happening as people kind of get subscription fatigue over all these subscriptions and where ESPN may end up being, the potential cost now, the potential cost if it's rolled up into Amazon, what are you hearing about pricing especially when you think about subscription shock?TIM BAYSINGER: I mean, it's fair to assume that a full streaming version of ESPN is going to be easily the most expensive streaming service on the market. I mean, you've seen the numbers. It could be anywhere, but they're-- currently, they're talking between $20 and $35 a month which is well more expensive than pretty much anything else out there.And obviously, the current version of ESPN's streaming service ESPN+, I mean, that's only like $5 a month, and they're making far less money off those subscribers versus the people that subscribe to ESPN on cable television. So a full version of ESPN streaming service is going to have to cost a lot more, because sports rights are not cheap. They're only going to get more expensive.ESPN not only is going to probably renew its NBA deal, that's up in a few years, it has its SEC football deal that's going to start pretty soon. So their costs are only going up.AKIKO FUJITA: Tim, it really-- things have really moved quickly when it comes to sports and streaming. Obviously, Amazon's had that deal with the NFL. You've got Apple with the MLB as well as MLS. What's the verdict so far, you think? I mean, for so long it was about-- the only reason to keep cable, to keep that cord was sports. And we've seen a lot of those move over to the streaming side.TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah, I mean, that was-- I would say about five or six years ago, that was the kind of talk you always heard was that sports were the one thing that was kind of holding the pay-TV bundle together. And while sports, especially the NFL, still get big viewership, it's turned out that people are still cutting the cord and moving to streaming, dropping their cable subscriptions. So it makes sense that sports is moving over to streaming.Now, I would describe what's happening as more of-- it's a lot of experimentation. I mean, the reason that Thursday Night Football went to Amazon was because it was on CBS, it was on NBC, it was on Fox before, and none of those networks really did that well with it, because, one, it had to be simulcast on NFL Network.And so it's really on Amazon. Because, frankly, a lot of the broadcast networks that have been NFL partners for years, they didn't really want it.DIANE KING HALL: And, Tim, I want to ask you. Akiko mentioned Apple. I know there had been talk about Apple potentially kind of bringing ESPN to its fold. Have you heard any recent talk of that especially when you think about what's happening now with Amazon?TIM BAYSINGER: I haven't heard that talk, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was happening because, as I said before, it really looks like Disney is talking to everybody in terms of how to help with ESPN. I mean, Disney CEO Bob Iger in their earnings call a few weeks ago, he mentioned one of the key things that they're looking for when talking for a strategic partner with ESPN is someone to help with distribution. Obviously, Amazon, Apple really kind of makes sense in a lot of those ways.AKIKO FUJITA: What do you think this means ultimately? And we should preface this by saying this is a report from the information. Disney hasn't necessarily come out and said, yes, we're teaming up with Amazon. But when you see where sports is moving in the streaming landscape, what does that ultimately mean for the viewing experience moving forward?Sure, we're used to sort of channel-hopping on sort of the traditional TV. But this is about subscription streaming services that viewers will need access to.TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah, I think you're going to see sports moving into this kind of bifurcation where more games are actually going to be on broadcast television. I've talked to my sources that are involved and have knowledge of the NBA's discussions that they're having is they want more games to be on ABC versus ESPN in the next deal.And what you're going to happen is you're going to see a lot of games, a lot of big ticket games move closer to broadcast. You're seeing it on the local side with some NBA teams like the Utah Jazz and the Phoenix Suns and in the NHL with the Vegas Golden Knights. They're taking their local television rights away from cable and moving them to broadcast.At the same time, there's this other wing that's going to be subscription whether that's some subscription companies or some streaming companies that are going to simulcast what's on broadcast television or you're going to see what's happening with the NFL and Amazon, or more specifically, the MLS and Apple which kind of went to a-- they'll have some games on Fox this season, but they're mostly going to a full subscription streaming model with Apple.And I think, big picture, what you're seeing is a lot of these leagues are going to be faced with this decision that used to not be a decision which is you can either get-- you can either reach the biggest audience, or you can make the most money. I don't think any more you can do both.AKIKO FUJITA: It'll be interesting to see how that all pans out, but it's good to get your take today. Tim Baysinger with Axios, appreciate your time.]"

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.TJX (TJX) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for TJX is 12.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 18.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 14%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for TJX is 8.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 3.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.4%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for TJX. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.4% over the past month.Bottom LineTJX has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions TJX well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ULTA posted robust second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.During the quarter, the company witnessed growth in all major categories (with skin care standing out), an increased number of loyalty members and greater brand engagement. The beauty category continued to generate growth. Ulta Beauty’s strong business model, diverse assortment and solid loyalty program helped drive the splendid results and encouraged management to raise its guidance for fiscal 2023.Quarterly NumbersUlta Beauty posted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.02 in the quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.87 and increased 5.6% year over year.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUlta Beauty Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ulta Beauty Inc. QuoteNet sales of this beauty product retailer rose 10.1% year over year to $2,529.8 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,508 million. The uptick can be attributed to higher comparable sales, solid new store performance and an increase in other revenues.Comparable sales (sales for stores open for at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) jumped 8% compared with our estimate of 5.9% growth. Comparable sales growth was driven by a 9% improvement in transactions, partly offset by a 1% drop in the average ticket.The gross profit advanced 7.1% to $993.6 million. The gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 39.3%, down 110 basis points year over year. Higher inventory shrink, reduced merchandise margins and elevated supply-chain costs were partly made up by strength in other revenues and store fixed-cost leverage.SG&amp;A expenses rose 12.4% to $600.7 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses came in at 23.7%, up from 23.3% reported in the year-ago quarter. We had expected SG&amp;A expenses to be 25.6% of net sales in the quarter. The year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A expenses was due to the deleverage of store payroll and benefits, increased store expenses and corporate overheads related to strategic investments, somewhat compensated by the leverage of incentive compensations.The operating income rose from $391.4 million to $391.6 million. The operating margin decreased from 17% to 15.5% compared with our estimate of 15.1%.Story continuesOther UpdatesUlta Beauty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $388.6 million. Net merchandise inventories were $1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Stockholders’ equity at the end of the quarter stood at $2,051.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $428.8 million in the 26 weeks ended Jul 29, 2023.The company repurchased 593,629 shares for $275.5 million in the quarter. In the first six months of fiscal 2023, ULTA repurchased 1.1 million shares for $559 million. As of Jul 29, 2023, Ulta Beauty had shares worth $541 million left under its buyback program announced in March 2022. The company anticipates a share repurchase of $900 million in fiscal 2023.For fiscal 2023, the capital expenditure is expected in the band of $400-$475 million.In the reported quarter, Ulta Beauty introduced three new stores, remodeled three and relocated two. Ulta Beauty ended the second quarter with 1,362 stores totaling 14.3 million square feet.For fiscal 2023, ULTA expects 25-30 net new stores, along with 20-30 store remodeling and relocation projects.GuidanceUlta Beauty now expects fiscal 2023 net sales in the range of $11.05-$11.15 billion compared with the $11-$11.1 billion band expected earlier. The company reported net sales of $10.2 billion in fiscal 2022.Comparable sales are expected to rise 4.5%-5.5%, up from 4-5% growth expected earlier. The company expects comps growth to moderate-to-low-single-digit growth in the second half of the year.Management expects an operating margin between 14.6% and 14.8% compared with the previous view of 14.5-14.8%. This includes expectations of nearly even deleverage from the gross margin and SG&amp;A.Management expects the operating margin to be under more pressure in the third quarter than the second quarter as it laps pricing gains (compared with the year-ago period) and due to an investment spending shift from the second quarter to the third quarter. Consequently, the third-quarter EPS is likely to decline year over year.For fiscal 2023, earnings are envisioned in the band of $25.10-$25.60 per share, suggesting a rise from the $24.01 per share reported in fiscal 2022. Management earlier projected the bottom line in the range of $24.70-$25.40 per share.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 0.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 0.9% growth.Stocks to ConsiderHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks.Kroger KR, a renowned grocery retailer, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapInvestigating the Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Newmont should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.42. These indicators suggest that Newmont, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Deciphering the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Snapshot: Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM)Newmont is the world's largest gold miner, producing about 6 million attributable ounces of gold in 2022, good for about 5% of global mined output. The company also produced 1.3 million attributable gold equivalent ounces from the sale of byproducts, including copper, silver, zinc, and lead in 2022. It had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant byproduct reserves at the end of 2022. After buying Goldcorp in 2019 and combining its Nevada mines in a joint venture with competitor Barrick later that year, Newmont's portfolio includes 12 wholly owned mines and interests in two joint ventures in the Americas, Africa, and Australia.Story continuesIs Newmont (NEM) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapNewmont's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Newmont's Altman Z-score reveals Newmont's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Newmont's historical data, 2021: 0.10; 2022: 0.08; 2023: 0.02, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Newmont's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Newmont's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.09; 2022: 0.02; 2023: 0.00) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Newmont might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionDespite its attractive valuation, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) exhibits several risk factors that could potentially make it a value trap. Investors need to consider these risks and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.

But instead of generating hype, citing shrink softens the blow of sinking profits.The most prominent mention of shrink in recent weeks came from Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS).On a call with analysts following its Aug. 22 earnings report, CFO Navdeep Gupta said, ""The biggest impact in terms of the surprise for Q2 primarily came from shrink."" Gupta went on to say, ""The number of incidents and the organized retail crime impact came in significantly higher than we anticipated."" The company cut its full-year profit outlook in response.The theme of missing merchandise also featured in recent calls from Dollar Tree (DLTR), Macy's (M), Home Depot (HD), and Target (TGT).Dick's Sporting Goods profit slipped in its second quarter and missed Wall Street's expectations as the retailer cut its full-year profit outlook, citing worries over theft at its stores. (Seth Wenig/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Analysts say the trend reflects a real problem for retailers, and one that they are taking steps to prevent.""Nobody wants to come out and say, 'We are not in control,'"" said David Johnston, NRF vice president of asset protection and retail operations. ""To see the number of CEOs coming out and talking about shrink and loss — it's an issue.""Dollar Tree, for instance, told investors it is installing locked cases on more items and even taking some SKUs out of stores in response to elevated theft. ""We are now taking a very defensive approach to shrink,"" Dollar Tree CEO Rick Dreiling told analysts this week.And as executives continue to hammer on the industry-wide threat coming from shrink, the concept has gathered momentum and can work as a crutch for explaining weaker financial performance.""There is a bandwagon effect here,"" said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData. ""When one retailer starts to call something out, others will look at it. And because everyone is interested in it, that fuels more mentions of theft.""Story continuesGrowing 'shrink'But data suggests that behind a new industry-wide excuse for business slowing down is an uptick in theft and increasing concerns for safety.Retailers say that shrink amounted to $94.5 billion in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation’s (NRF) annual of survey of companies, up from $90.8 billion in 2020. As a percentage of sales, however, that figure came out to about 1.4% of sales, down from 1.6% in 2020.Retailers also reported a 26.5% increase in organized retail crime incidents, when groups of professional shoplifters steal and resell stolen goods. While the latest figures are nearly two years old, sustained commentary from executives suggests that shrink is a growing problem for them.Jonathan Simon, a criminal justice professor at UC Berkeley School of Law, said businesses probably do have relatively accurate estimates of how much their inventory is shrinking due to theft. And that it's possible retail theft has increased partially because of online resale platforms, which serve as a conduit for organized theft for profit.""But businesses also have an incentive to place more emphasis on theft as it shifts the responsibility for business shrinkage — never a good look to investors or customers — to an abstract but blameworthy factor like organized crime,"" he said.The public also has a tendency to place all retail theft in the same category, he added, lumping together organized theft, survival theft by unhoused or very poor people, and teenagers and younger adults acting out by stealing. ""Each of these really needs to be seen as distinct problems with distinct solutions.""A Nordstrom department store at the Grove mall in Los Angeles, where a smash-and-grab robbery drew attention to organized retails thefts. (Jae C. Hong/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Beyond the 'smash and grab'The dramatic crime figures and sensationalized videos that have drawn broader public attention have also invited criticism that the problem might be overblown.In a widely covered backtrack, Walgreens CFO James Kehoe said earlier this year that the pharmacy chain ""cried too much"" about theft on a prior earnings call that was among the first to ignite concerns about retail crime.But retail industry experts insist this quarter's references to shrink aren't merely executives crying wolf.Janine Stichter, a research analyst covering consumer retail and lifestyle platforms at BTIG, said citing shrink figures isn't something that you can fake for very long.Stichter sees the timing of shrink's big moment in earnings calls, which picked up at the end of last year, as coinciding with price increases and a weaker economic environment, highlighting a link between crime and a tougher economy.Under the strain of higher costs, consumers squeezed by inflation, and shifts in shopping habits, the industry faces a host of challenges even without the pain and risks of theft.""Shrink is clearly an issue, but so is the tremendous volatility that the consumer and retail has experienced over the last nearly four years,"" said Ethan Chernofsky, senior vice president of marketing at Placer.ai, a location analytics firm.""The pandemic presented a unique set of circumstances and just when we expected a period of normalcy as the pandemic's effects faded, a wide array of economic challenges disrupted retail 'normalcy.'""Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the pet care market, you can go directly to Top 5 Smartest Dog Breeds Ranked.Bringing home a new pet is exciting, but it’s also important to do your homework before committing. If you want to adopt an intelligent furry friend for your household, there’s data available that could help you make the right choice. Fortunately, for potential dog owners, some of the smartest dog breeds are also the most friendly and affectionate.A dog is surely a man's best friend. Dogs are loving, loyal, and friendly creatures that have been companions to humans for centuries. They provide security, companionship, and unconditional love, which are just some of the reasons why we love keeping dogs as pets.With more and more people adopting dogs and other friendly creatures, the pet care market is expected to grow and so is the demand for high-quality pet care products and services.The Global Pet Care Market: An AnalysisPreviously, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused people around the world to suffer from a mental state of isolation as they were forced to stay at home with lockdowns around the world. Having a pet can undoubtedly help an individual recover from such a mental state. Moreover, during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, dog owners were highly conscious about keeping their pets from getting infected.While pet ownership and the demand for pet care products surged during the pandemic, shutting down of pet food stores due to lockdowns hampered the profitability for some of the companies in this space. However, easing lockdowns combined with the increasing rate of pet humanization, has helped the global pet care market recover.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global pet care market was valued at $235.32 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.92% during 2023-2030, pushing the market to reach $368.88 billion by the end of the forecasted period. Over the past few years, a lot of people have started investing highly in pet care products such as accessories, pet fashion, pet health, pet food, pet grooming, hygiene and toys. It seems that the millennial generation, especially in the more developed countries, see pets as family members. The pet humanization trend coupled with an increased demand for premium pet care products is creating a positive outlook and driving the market growth for pet care products. Moreover, an increasing number of pet owners are very particular about representing their lifestyles by spending on luxurious as well as comfortable products for their pets. This has encouraged many market competitors to launch new and customized products in the pet grooming service segment, further augmenting market growth. Growing consumer awareness with regards to the availability of animal care products is further driving growth of the other segments, including health, hygiene, toys, and others. The forecast period could prove to be truly beneficial for some of the pet care companies like Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY), Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF), and Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS).Story continuesIn one of our previous articles about dog foods, we briefly discussed costs associated with owning a pet and that a total of $123.6 billion was spent on pets in 2021. According to Forbes, in 2022, Americans spent $136.8 billion on their pets, up 10.68% from the figure of $123.6 billion in 2021. Pet ownership in the US has witnessed a surge over the past three decades and as of 2023, about 66% of households in America own a pet. This post also mentions that 76% of cat owners and 85% of dog owners consider their pets to be a family member. The pet humanization trend and overall spending on pets is expected to further grow in the coming years.Dogs are the most popular pets in America, followed by cats. According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, about 59% of dogs and 61% of cats were classified as overweight or obese in 2022. Owing to obesity risks in pets, there is a growing demand for natural pet food in the US. This presents a great opportunity for some of the top players in the pet care market to manufacture and meet the demand for value added quality ingredients, diets and other pet care products.What are Some of the Biggest Companies in the Pet Care Industry Up To?Some of the key players in the pet care industry are shifting their focus towards expanding their product portfolio and manufacturing and offering premium quality pet care items. In order to increase their revenues, some of the companies are also expanding their business across global markets.For instance, on June 1, Reuters reported that shares of Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY) surged as much as 27% after the pet products e-retailer announced its first move into international markets through Canada and raised its annual revenue forecast. Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY) was one of the biggest winners in the pet care sector after the COVID-19 crisis sparked a hike in pet ownership. The post also mentions that the company’s Canada expansion is expected to help increase its total addressable market by $12-$15 billion.Previously, on May 4, Reuters had reported that Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) announced weaker-than-expected sales and pet products revenue of $1.23 billion in the first quarter, missing analysts’ estimates of $1.4 billion, because of inflation and staffing shortages at pet clinics. Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) said that this was due to short-term factors and that demand from pet owners remained strong. The CEO of the company, Kristin Peck, said that based on data from veterinary clinics, retailers, and pet owners, the end-market demand in companion animal channels remains strong.It appears that the rise in pet ownership as well as the demand for pet care products and services has been truly beneficial for Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) in the second quarter. On August 8, Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.41, surpassing EPS estimates by $0.10. The company reported a revenue of $2.18 billion and outperformed revenue estimates by $22.70 million. Here are some comments from Zoetis Inc.’s (NYSE:ZTS) Q2 2023 earnings call:“We continue to see strong customer demand for our companion animal portfolio. For the first half of 2023, companion animal grew 5% operationally. We believe companion animal should be a bigger driver of performance for the remainder of the year with a stronger second half driven by our key franchises. While we are monitoring how inflationary pressures may impact pet care spending in markets around the world, the underlying demand has remained steady and resilient to date, and this is what we have seen historically. In the U.S., veterinary clinic visits continue to stabilize, staying relatively flat through the first half of the year, and clinic revenue and spend per visit were both up about 9% in the U.S. in the first half.”On June 14, CNBC reported that Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF) has partnered with Snoop Dogg for a new pet care campaign. The collaboration featured Petco Picks by Snoop, which included toys, treats and grooming supplies, while also offering social content showcasing behind-the-scenes footage of the rapper with pets, including his reflections on being a devoted dog owner. The post also mentions that according to the US Department of Labor, the cost for pet services, including veterinary care, was up 10.6% year over year in May, and pet food costs were up 13.8% during the same period.Now that we have discussed some recent developments in the pet care market, let's take a look at the top 20 smartest dog breeds.Top 20 Smartest Dog Breeds RankedCopyright: mezzotint123rf / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyIn this article, we have ranked the top 20 smartest dog breeds in terms of their intelligence.

This day also highlights the importance of understanding the past and current relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous society to create a more open dialogue.Storytelling is a central part of Indigenous identity. In honor of that practice, we want to share the stories of two teams within NRG and their work in support of Indigenous groups.Sharing the sunGoal Zero, a brand focused on sustainable portable power products, empowers people with energy resilience solutions. The business donates and installs solar generators on homes in the Navajo Nation to help communities without access to power. In 2020, Goal Zero partnered with Heart of America to leverage its education-focused connection in the Navajo Nation. Together, the organizations are providing free, sustainable power for students and their families.With 275 installations so far, the partnership goes beyond providing electricity. It's also helping students complete their schoolwork and focus on their education.""The power is independent of the grid, so families don't have to pay for electricity. This includes providing lighting so that students can complete homework and pursue hobbies and activities beyond their classrooms,"" says Brianna Blaschke, Humanitarian and Events Associate Manager at Goal Zero.Access to electricity has improved the lives of many Navajo families. Now, they can charge school-provided electronics and personal devices, power home appliances, and have uninterrupted power for general living. With these successes, Goal Zero and Heart of America don't plan on slowing down anytime soon.""Our goal is to supply power to all the unpowered homes across the Navajo Nation while continuing to update our donations to match the growing needs of the community. We also aim to develop a training program to provide an avenue for long-term skill development and eventual employment opportunities for Navajo Nation residents,"" says Blaschke.Story continuesRISE-ing to the occasionThe Reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and Supporting Equity (RISE) business resources group is taking the initiative to raise awareness of Indigenous people in our communities and in the workplace.""We were starting to see some gaps in how we're meeting the unique needs of the Indigenous communities that we support or service,"" says Stacey Schorr, Director of Government Affairs at Direct Energy and member of RISE. ""Employees were also asking more questions and were not aware of how Indigenous history has developed in Canada.""RISE saw an opportunity to foster and improve the relationships with Indigenous communities. The group also recognized the need for more education and awareness at work.""This past spring, we brought in a speaker who walked through the histories of the Indigenous communities in Canada. She brought in a talking stick, and there were opportunities to share your experience. It was amazing to me how, even in the office environment, people really opened up,"" says Schorr.To gain a better understanding and have meaningful dialogue, members of RISE believe it's important for organizations to have conversations that incorporate diversity, equity, and inclusion.""For me, it means recognizing, respecting, and valuing the unique cultural, historical, and social experience of Indigenous communities. It involves creating an environment through education, awareness, and cultural competency where organizations are better equipped to address and dismantle systematic barriers that exist for Indigenous people,"" says Colleen Geddes, Customer Experience Analyst at NRG and member of RISE.Schorr also adds, ""Everybody views diversity, equity, and inclusion from a different perspective, and it's often built upon what your individual experiences are. What I really appreciate is creating a space to have those conversations.""RISE acknowledges the significance of the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples as it aligns with their mission to educate and bring attention to the culture and unique challenges of Indigenous people.""The day provides an opportunity to educate the public about the rich cultural heritage, traditions, and contributions of the Indigenous community. It amplifies their voices to remind people of the struggles for the rights and well-being of Indigenous people while celebrating their resilience,"" says Geddes.Working together for greater equality""Indigenous worldviews often have the philosophy of interconnectedness and belonging,"" says Geddes. ""With the foundation that we are all related, the group then becomes accountable for each of their actions. Each child, youth, adult, and elder has a role and a responsibility to each other and the community.""By honoring Indigenous cultures and acknowledging historical injustices, we can make progress toward a more equitable future. Through collective action, we can work toward a more inclusive future where the rights, cultures, and contributions of all people are valued and respected.If you're thinking about getting involved, Blaschke says, ""Heart of America accepts general donations to help fund these projects and the purchase of products to provide for students and their families. People can also shop to provide school supplies for education kits.""Watch the following video to learn more about the collaboration between Goal Zero and Heart of America to bring sustainable power to Indigenous communities across the Navajo Nation.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from NRG Energy on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: NRG EnergyWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/nrg-energyEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: NRG EnergyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/777158/Embracing-Diversity-and-Amplifying-Indigenous-Voices]"

HPQ is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 29.The company expects fiscal third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share between 81 cents and 91 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 85 cents, indicating a decline of 18.3% from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $13.33 billion, suggesting a decline of 9.1% from the prior-year quarter.HP’s earnings surpassed the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters while matching the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 2%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the announcement.HP Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHP Inc. price-eps-surprise | HP Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderHP’s third-quarter performance is likely to have witnessed a negative impact of the slowdown in consumer demand for PCs and high inventory levels. HP witnessed the robust demand for its PCs during the pandemic-led work-and-learn-from-home wave.However, the reopening of economies and offices, inflationary pressure and recession concerns have been waning the demand for PCs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Consumer PC’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.74 billion.Furthermore, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. This might have hurt HP’s commercial PC sales in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for Commercial PC’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $5.05 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HP’s Personal Systems revenues is pegged at $8.79 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 12.8%.Per the preliminary data released by Gartner in July 2023, PC shipments in the April-June 2023 quarter plunged 16.6% year over year to 59.7 million units. The latest data compiled by the market research firm depicts the seventh consecutive quarter of a PC sales decline following two successive years of strong year-over-year growth, driven by the pandemic-led increased demand for remote working and online learning tools. (Read more: Q2 PC Shipment Data Shows Signs of Stabilization in PC Market)Story continuesHowever, the second-quarter PC shipment data shows a strong improvement from the first quarter when PC vendors had shipped 55.2 million units. The research firm sees the sequential improvement in PC shipments as an initial sign of stabilization in the PC market.HP’s Printing division’s sales are likely to have been hampered by softened consumer demand. The consensus mark for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.57 billion.Furthermore, HP’s third-quarter bottom line is likely to have witnessed the benefits of favorable pricing, disciplined cost management and a better product mix. However, lower revenues, higher commodity costs, unfavorable currency exchange rates, increased investments in innovation and the go-to-market strategy are expected to have more than offset the benefits.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for HP Inc. this season.

However, COVID-19 is likely to have impacted the company’s Dental business in the fiscal first quarter.Per management, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, sales at this segment increased 7.4% year over year. The improvement was driven by growth in all sub-segments. Strength was seen across all equipment categories as well as in technical service, software and e-services. Meanwhile, the consumables portfolio of non-infection control products continues to recover amid deflationary impact for certain products. These trends are likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, sales in the Animal Health segment increased 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. The Animal Health segment has been gaining from growth in pet adoptions and increased attention to pets. On its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call, the companion animal business continued to show signs of prosperity and expected to gain from the long-term tailwinds of higher pet ownership in the past two years. Consequently, this trend is likely to get reflected in the first-quarter results.Story continuesMeanwhile, foundation initiatives including improved mix, exercising expense discipline and leveraging cost structure are expected to have improved gross and operating margins during the soon-to-be-reported quarter.

110,ae5ec1a0-6c96-3d1b-b0e2-d6df47e2cadb,MA,2023-08-26,Visa And Mastercard Distancing Themselves From Binance Unlikely to Hurt the Crypto Exchange: Experts,CoinDesk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-mastercard-distancing-themselves-binance-204841435.html,1692996521,STORY,"['MA', 'V']","[Payment giants Visa and Mastercard paring back their ties with Binance isn’t surprising as the company grapples with recent legal challenges, but it is unlikely to hurt the crypto exchange’s market share.Binance, the biggest crypto exchange by trading volume, is facing multiple charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including allegations that the exchange has been operating an unregistered business and misled investors about the company’s risks. This is in addition to charges brought against the exchange by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in May for what it calls a “willful evasion"" of U.S. law.The U.S. Department of Justice is also looking into the exchange and is reportedly considering charging Binance for fraud.Given all the legal challenges Binance is facing, the move by mainstream companies like Visa and Mastercard is not surprising, said Dave Weisberger, CEO and co-founder of CoinRoutes. “It’s unsurprising that payment processors want to distance themselves from that,” he said.Visa reportedly stopped issuing new co-branded cards with Binance in Europe. A Mastercard spokesperson confirmed the end of its partnerships to CoinDesk with Binance, without providing the details behind the decision. “We had four pilot programs in the market with them – Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Bahrain. This decision applies to each of these Binance programs. There is no impact on any other crypto card program,” the spokesperson said. Visa didn't immediately respond to requests for comments.Binance said on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) that the Binance Card will no longer be available to users in Latin America and the Middle East.However, the move is unlikely to hurt the crypto exchange’s market share, given its extensive global footprint. “It’s difficult to assess the impact of this on Binance, which is still a leading exchange from a liquidity point of view,” Weisberger said. “Until that changes, people will continue to trade there,” he added.Story continuesThe end of the partnership may also not be a big deal for the industry as a whole, said Leo Mizuhara, CEO of Hashnote, a CFTC-regulated institutional digital asset management platform. “This development is probably not that big of a deal in terms of the impact on the industry, as people and organizations pulling away from Binance was already pretty much expected given its issues with the CFTC and DOJ,” Mizuhara said.He also said that Mastercard’s decision to distance itself from Binance seems reasonable given the credit card giant’s recent focus on the blockchain industry. “Mastercard has shown an increasing appetite to engage with the blockchain industry, and this move away from Binance is more about institutions being cautious about potential bad actors,” Mizuhara added.Both Visa and Mastercard have been active in the blockchain industry recently, even during the prolonged bear market that saw several major bankruptcies. Most recently, both Visa and Mastercard said they intend to continue with their industry partners to bring payment programs into the markets.Read more: Visa's Crypto Strategy Remains Intact Despite Crypto Winter]"

The first such measure pertains to awarding Bahrain Commercial Facilities Company (“BCFC”), Mastercard Digital First program certificate. Furthermore, Mastercard also partnered with UAE’s Artificial Intelligence Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications Office to promote the adoption of AI to reduce financial crimes.With BCFC attaining MA’s distinguished recognition, it has improved its position as a trusted partner in digital payments. MA’s digital-first program is aimed at assisting financial institutions to serve customers with a secure and seamless digital experience and improve the standard of their digital lending solutions. MA’s program also allows financial institutions to provide access to instant digital card issuance, view digital card information, and many other perks.This initiative empowers consumers by granting them greater control over their finances while ensuring enhanced security. Mastercard aims to leverage its Digital First program to expand its influence and cater to the evolving demands of customers in Bahrain. This program is also expected to result in cost savings, new customer sales, an increase in transaction volume and a reduction in digital frauds, benefiting consumers and financial institutions and boosting MA’s business.Mastercard signed a memorandum of understanding with the UAE to improve AI capabilities in the region. This move bodes well for UAE’s ambitions to accelerate the adoption of AI to further advance its digital ecosystem by partnering with private sector and international companies. This collaboration builds on the UAE Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031 and is expected to improve UAE’s position as an AI-leading hub. AI is expected to provide a technology-driven framework for priority sectors, ultimately reducing financial crimes and improving performance.Story continuesPartnerships similar to the latest one bear testament to Mastercard’s digital transformation efforts across the UAE. A booming digital economy, spurred by increased Internet penetration and usage of smartphones, might have prompted MA to expand its reach to the UAE. Per PWC, AI is expected to contribute $320 billion to UAE and $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030. MA aims to strengthen its foothold in the UAE to gain from its booming digital economy.Shares of Mastercard have gained 19.8% in a year compared with the industry’s 8.6% growth.

The contract will serve the Marine Corps with 27 aircraft and the government of Israel with eight aircraft.Valued at $2.77 billion, the contract also highlights aircraft and programmatic support as well as logistical support and spare services by LMT for the stealth helicopter.The deal has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. The contract is expected to be complete by December 2027. The work related to this deal will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Military helicopters are witnessing strong demand, mainly due to advancements and the integration of new tactical and logistical features. This tends to boost LMT’s order inflow prospects involving production and modification contracts for helicopters, like the latest one.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2022-2027 period. This should benefit Lockheed as the company enjoys a dominant position in the military helicopter market with its portfolio containing programs like e Black Hawk, Seahawk and CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopters.This should continue to boost LMT’s revenues from its Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises Sikorsky helicopters. This is likely to bolster its overall revenue generation prospects.Peer ProspectsOther defense companies that may enjoy the perks of the expanding military helicopter market are as follows:Boeing BA: Its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s primary products include fixed-wing military aircraft, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.

Its investors have gained 32.1% in the past year.Airbus Group EADSY: It is one of the world's largest suppliers of advanced military helicopters. Its product portfolio includes the H135 combat helicopter, the H145M helicopter, AS565 MBe, H160M, H175M, H215M, H225M and a few more.Airbus’ long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 12.4%.

116,7bc320e6-f1e0-3686-88ca-dd8aa2e4ff12,PHM,2023-08-26,Construction Check-Highly Ranked Stocks to Buy Among the Blazing Sector,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/construction-check-highly-ranked-stocks-024200593.html,1693017720,STORY,"['PHM', 'OC', 'TEX']","[The construction space remains one of the strongest areas of the economy with the Zacks Construction sector currently holding the top spot out of 16 Zacks sectors.With a combined total return (including dividends) of +28% YTD, the Zacks Construction sector has easily topped the S&amp;P 500's +16% and roughly matched the Nasdaq’s +30%.Even with mortgage rates rising to multi-year highs at 7%, the backlog for homebuilders is high due to lingering demand from the pandemic. On top of that increased infrastructure spending in the U.S. economy has served as a further catalyst with projects in motion to maintain or build bridges and roads across the country.That being said, monitoring stocks that can benefit from these construction-related activities is an intelligent investment idea. Here are three to consider that all boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOwens Corning OC: Staying on the strong buy list since early July, Owens Corning’s stock remains intriguing. As a worldwide leader in building materials systems and composite solutions, Owens stock has soared +59% in 2023.Intriguingly, Owens stock still offers good value to investors even after this year's extensive rally. Owens stock trades at just 10.7X forward earnings which is an attractive discount to the Zacks Building Products-Miscellaneous Industry average of 14.8X and the S&amp;P 500’s 20.4X.  Furthermore, earnings estimates have soared over the last 30 days which is a strong indication there could be even more upside for OC shares. Owens is expecting steady growth with earnings now projected to be up 5% this year and rise another 2% in FY24 to $13.92 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPulteGroup PHM: The trend of rising earnings estimates is compelling for PulteGroup’s stock as well with the company prospering as a home builder that offers financial services. PulteGroup was added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list in late July and has skyrocketed +69% this year.Story continuesNotably, fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have leaped 16% in the last 30 days and have now soared 30% over the last quarter. The trend in FY24 earnings estimate revisions is similar making PulteGroup’s stock very compelling.Annual earnings are now projected to jump 7% in FY23 and rise another 1% in FY24 to $11.71 per share. What is most intriguing about PulteGroup stock is its price-to-earnings valuation. At just 6.7X forward earnings, PulteGroup’s stock still trades slightly beneath its Building Products-Home Builders Industry average of 8.7X and at a very attractive discount to the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTerex TEX: We will go outside the box for the last stock with Terex belonging to the Zacks Industrial Products sector but providing work platforms, materials, and machinery that are critical to construction activities.Terex was added to the strong buy list in early August with it being noteworthy that its Manufacturing-Construction and Mining Industry is in the top 1% of over 250 Zacks industries.Earnings estimates have climbed over the last 30 days with Terex’s EPS expected to skyrocket 58% in FY23 to $6.83 per share compared to $4.32 a share last year. Plus, FY24 earnings are expected to rise another 4%.Trading at 8X forward earnings Terex stock offers a nice discount to the industry average of 13.4X and the benchmark. Furthermore, Terex stock is up +32% YTD which correlates with the strong performance of the Zacks Construction sector and has largely outperformed the Industrial Products sectors +6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineRising earnings estimates indicate these construction-related stocks may continue their blazing price performances in 2023. More reassuring is that Owens Corning, PulteGroup, and Terex stock still offer good value to investors at their current levels and are viable investments for 2023 and beyond.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

117,7abd7daa-d1ac-3f64-b457-ae7c177688ab,JNJ,2023-08-26,Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Shares Jump 17% in a Month: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novo-nordisks-nvo-shares-jump-154100109.html,1692978060,STORY,"['NOVO-B.CO', 'LLY', 'NVO', 'PFE', 'JNJ']","[Shares of Novo Nordisk NVO have risen 17.1% in the past month compared with the industry’s 5.0% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis upside is attributable to the company’s popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy (semaglutide).Earlier this month, Novo Nordisk reported positive data from the phase III SELECT study, which evaluated Wegovy as an adjunctive treatment for preventing cardiovascular (“CV”) diseases in adults with overweight or obesity. Data from the study showed that treatment with the drug reduced the risk of major adverse CV events by 20%.This was an encouraging response, as shares have risen consistently following this announcement. Obesity is one of the major risk factors responsible for CV diseases. A weight-loss drug like Wegovy having CV benefits will likely boost the drug’s sales. In addition, the drug would likely become eligible for insurance coverage. Currently, obesity drugs like Wegovy are considered lifestyle drugs and not eligible for coverage under Medicare health plans.Since its launch, sales of Wegovy have been gaining momentum. Wegovy sales were up 543% in second-quarter 2023. The company raised the full-year 2023 sales outlook and profit expectations based on the upside. To further boost the top line, it is also evaluating a once-daily oral formulation of semaglutide for obesity indication in late-stage studies, with a potential FDA filing expected later this year.The FDA also approved semaglutide in 2017 to treat type 2 diabetes (“T2D”), which is being marketed under the trade name Ozempic.However, stiff competition from other pharma bigwigs, like Eli Lilly LLY and Pfizer PFE, is starting to take shape in the global diabetes market for Novo Nordisk.In June, Lilly announced that it had completed the regulatory submission seeking label expansion for its dual GIP/GLP-1-RA drug tirzepatide to treat obesity or overweight in adults. A final decision is expected by 2023-end. While data from one late-stage study (SURMOUNT-1) released last year showed that treatment with the drug led to a mean weight reduction of up to 22.5% in patients without diabetes, data from a second late-stage study (SURMOUNT-2) showed that tirzepatide treatment achieved mean reduction up to 15.7% in T2D patients.Story continuesLilly’s Tirzepatide was approved in May 2022 for treating adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (“T2DM”) and is being marketed under the brand name Mounjaro. Since its launch, Mounjaro has shown an impressive initial uptake, recording $980 million in revenues in second-quarter 2023.An expansion in the obesity indication would help Lilly rake in billions of dollars from Mounjaro sales.Pfizer PFE is also evaluating pipeline candidates for obesity. Currently, Pfizer is lagging behind Lilly and Novartis in terms of development for obesity treatments. This June, Pfizer reported a major setback in its obesity pipeline when it announced its decision to discontinue development of a once-daily oral obesity drug lotiglipron, in favor of a twice-daily orally administered danuglipron. This decision was based on data from multiple phase I drug-drug-interaction studies and an ongoing phase II study wherein study participants treated with lotiglipron were shown to have elevated levels of liver enzymes.Pfizer is currently evaluating danuglipron in a phase II study in patients with obesity and T2DM. If this study is successful, management plans to start phase III studies by year-end.Novo Nordisk A/S Price Novo Nordisk A/S PriceNovo Nordisk A/S price | Novo Nordisk A/S Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Key PickNovo Nordisk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

118,82bc2861-c6eb-300b-96e0-8545b3503b45,JNJ,2023-08-26,Emergent BioSolutions (EBS) Down 12% in a Week: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/emergent-biosolutions-ebs-down-12-153600729.html,1692977760,STORY,"['EBS', 'JNJ', 'AAP']","[Since the past week, Emergent BioSolutions’ EBS shares have lost 11.5% against the industry’s 1.9% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe downside came after the S&amp;P Global announced that Advance Auto Parts AAP will replace the company in the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 index. Per S&amp;P Global, Emergent no longer represents the small-cap market space, hence the substitution with Advance Auto Parts, which satisfies the index requirements. This change will be effective before the opening of trading from today, i.e., Aug 25, 2023.Due to the removal from the index, several market participants, such as mutual funds and ETFs, which maintain positions on stock in the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 index, are more likely to sell their positions in the company’s stock, which is no longer a part of this index. This will likely cause a downward pressure on the share price.Moody’s Investors Service recently downgraded the company’s credit rating to Caa1 and issued a negative outlook on the stock. The main reason for this downgrade was the company’s “weak liquidity"" and unpredictable revenue outlook amid the government's decision to defer purchases of the company’s vaccines.In its Q2 earnings call, management stated that the fall in revenue guidance is due to lower expectations from anthrax and smallpox franchises following discussions with the United States government.The downgrade also comes a couple of weeks after Emergent announced that it will implement strategic plans to reduce focus on its CDMO service business. The company plans on prioritizing the advancement of its core product businesses — medical countermeasures and Narcan Nasal Spray — and the timely delivery of its products to its existing customers, including the United States and allied governments. While the decision is expected to result in an annualized savings of almost $100 million, it will reduce the present workforce by nearly 400 employees.Earlier this March, the FDA granted over-the-counter (OTC) status to Narcan nasal spray for emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Following the approval, Narcan is the first and currently the only naloxone NCI nasal spray available for opioid overdose in the U.S. market without a prescription. The medication will be made available later this year.Story continuesIn the past couple of years, the company has lost significant market value, likely due to the loss of contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services contracts from AstraZeneca AZN and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ in 2021. Emergent suffered this setback when there was a manufacturing mishap at its Bayview facility where COVID-19 vaccine ingredients of J&amp;J and AstraZeneca reportedly got mixed and led to several faulty batches of J&amp;J’s vaccine. Emergent lost its contract for AstraZeneca’s vaccine following the mishap. In June 2022, Emergent and J&amp;J announced their decision to terminate the deal, citing contract breaches.Emergent Biosolutions Inc. Price Emergent Biosolutions Inc.

Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani joins the Live show to break down the lawsuit and what to expect moving forward.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: This morning AstraZeneca announced it was filing suit against the US for certain provisions on drug prices found in the Inflation Reduction Act. AstraZeneca joining the likes of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, and Bristol Myers, as well as not-for-profit AARP in the battle over drug pricing. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani to learn more about this story. Anje.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Julie. AstraZeneca now joins as the sixth pharmaceutical company to file a suit against the US Health Department, Secretary Becerra, as well as CMS alleging that parts of the Inflation Reduction Act are hampering innovation. We've heard this argument before from a number of other pharmaceutical companies.But in this suit AstraZeneca, pointed out a specific part of drug development, the Orphan Drug Act dating back to the 1980s. And that it says has incentivized a lot of the rare disease drug innovation. And so the IRA in effect goes ahead long against that incentive, and so it might disincentivize manufacturers. Now, it did also cite the Fifth Amendment, which is one of the three key amendments that other pharmaceuticals have cited.They've cited the First Amendment, saying that it is going against the freedom of speech. Fifth Amendment that the government is allegedly seizing property in the form of these negotiations and negotiated prices. And the Eighth Amendment as well has been cited for excess fines for non-compliance of this program. So AstraZeneca put its hat in the ring with the Fifth Amendment also saying that that is where it believes there has been an infringement and calling it unconstitutional as well.Story continuesIt is interesting to see this development. We do expect more companies to sign on and do expect more lawsuits as the administration looks to unveil that first list of 10 targeted medicines next week. So keep an eye out on that. We also saw a filing from AARP joining in on behalf of the US government. That came this week looking to-- or sorry, last week looking to side with the US government against the suit brought on by the US Chamber of Commerce, as well as a number of other chambers.They also said that they're going to be filing against Merck by September 18 and against the suit brought on by industry lobbying firm PhRMA on August 6. So all told, it's certainly heating up to be an interesting time to look at this whole negotiation unfolding. Of course, the target for that is going to be 2026 when all this goes into play. So until then, a lot developing.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, indeed. Anjalee, there's also news coming out about the weight loss drug, Wegovy. What can you tell us about that?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. Yet another study just came out to show that it does help reduce fatigue and shortness of breath and other symptoms of heart failure, that in addition to a recent study showing 20% reduction of risk in heart attack, stroke, and death. And so this just adds on to the growing list of benefits that we're seeing for Novo Nordisk, the weight loss drug, that could put pressure on insurance companies to then cover now. That it shows benefit beyond those weights loss benefits.So just another thing to keep an eye on and just additional pressure for these insurers. And we do expect, of course, to see more studies on other benefits to these companies, including Eli Lilly for their Mounjaro are, first of all, awaiting approval for weight loss. And also looking for other diseases and other benefits like sleep apnea and certain liver diseases. So interesting to see how this will all play out.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, indeed it is.

ALK is benefiting from its improved air-travel demand and fleet-modernization initiatives.Factors Favoring ALKImprovement in air-travel demand bodes well for Alaska Air.

It projects 2023 total revenues to increase 8-10% from 2022's actuals. To match the upbeat demand, capacity in the current year is anticipated to expand in the 11-13% range. Alaska Air’s fleet-modernization initiatives are encouraging. In March, the company modified its Boeing order to include the bigger MAX 10s and longer-range MAX 8s. The carrier’s contract consists of 145 firm orders and options for Boeing 737-9 aircraft, scheduled for delivery between 2021-2026.In a bid to modernize its fleet, Alaska Airlines announced in October the decision to exercise its option of purchasing 52 more 737 MAX jets from Boeing.

It is worth mentioning that most of the Cigna unit’s customers will have to face prior authorization requirements on less than four per cent of medical services.The removal of the above-mentioned requirement reflects Cigna’s efforts to provide a seamless health care experience for patients and clinicians in value-based care contracts. Prior authorization implies the process whereby health providers need to obtain the approval from the health plan of a patient prior to commencing with a treatment, procedure, or medication. This, in turn, ensures the safety of patients and makes the health care delivery a cost-effective one.The facility also boosts patients’ adherence to evidence-based care standards.Despite numerous benefits, clinicians and health plans are often found grappling with administrative workload amid the prior authorization procedure. This might lead to delay in care delivery and can also lead to lower medication adherence by patients.Considering the dire need to provide timely care, Cigna Healthcare has removed prior authorization on 1,100-plus medical services since 2020. The unit plans to relieve Medicare Advantage customers by removing prior authorization requirements for approximately another 500 medical services in the later part of 2023.The latest initiative reflects Cigna’s sincere efforts to enhance value-based care and thereby, lure more clients to opt for Cigna Healthcare’s plans. This, in turn, is likely to fetch higher membership growth and the resultant benefit will be in the form of improved premiums, the most significant contributor to the top line of a health insurer like Cigna. Through the Cigna Healthcare unit, it serves customers of U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses.Story continuesTotal medical customers of CI increased 9.5% year over year as of Jun 30, 2023. The results of the Cigna Healthcare unit benefited on the back of the expanding customer base in the first half of 2023.In addition to the latest initiative, Cigna recently undertook another effort to impart greater strength to the Cigna Healthcare business. It collaborated with the global digital-first health and well-being engagement company, Virgin Pulse, this month to provide an advanced digital platform. The platform can be accessed at myCigna by specific employer-sponsored plan clients of Cigna Healthcare from the very beginning of 2024 and is a means to bring enhanced whole-person wellbeing for around 11 million customers of Cigna.Shares of Cigna have gained 15.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 1.6% growth.

Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brad Smith break down the report and the outlook for the sporting goods retail company.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Hibbett Sports' bright spot in the retail space today after reiterating its full year guidance despite other retailers, particularly sporting goods ones feeling pressure from rising levels of shoplifting and also maybe lower consumer demand.The company's same store sales did fall 7.6% year over year, but profit did come in ahead of expectations and perhaps a bit of a relief rally here because Hibbett has been under pressure along with the rest of the sector over the course of the week.The company also holding fast to its full year profit forecast, so that also could be helping matters hereBRAD SMITH: Yeah. This was an interesting report here because two of the things that jumped out to me on headline when you kind of first look through the release was that they had second quarter comp sales decreased by about 7.3%, and net sales were down 4.6% year over year.When we were looking at this and knowing that they were going to be reporting earnings this morning, we said it could be a similar reaction that we see in what DICK'S had seen earlier this week. And DICK'S in that decline that had taken place. They still have not recovered from that after they had reported earnings here.But you've got to wonder if investors are just kind of looking out into the future here, looking at some of the opportunity for Hibbett in what they put into their guidance. But those comp sales decreases and then additionally e-commerce sales decreases 5.2% over year over year-- on a year over year basis. And that representing 15.1% of their total net sales for the period.You just got to wonder, like, what investors are paying attention to on this one.JULIE HYMAN: Well, maybe they're paying attention to bad news being priced in perhaps. We saw the weekly chart there. We also saw the chart year to date in which the stock is down almost 40% going into today's numbers. So the bounce then makes-- I mean, it's still a chart that does not reflect a lot of optimism over the longer term for the company.Story continuesAnd if you look at these numbers, to your point, they're not great numbers. Year over year declines in comps in earnings per share, gross margin advancing year over year. But 30-- or excuse me, falling year over year, but beating estimates at 32.8%.Just to give a little background as well for those who aren't as familiar with Hibbett Sports, I feel like DICK'S is a more national name, right? Foot Locker certainly a more national and international name as well. This company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, where you were just--BRAD SMITH: I was just down there.JULIE HYMAN: I know you were. And they have just over 1,100 Hibbett and City Gear stores in 36 states. So more stores actually than DICK'S. But I think DICK'S has a bigger store-- the stores themselves are larger.BRAD SMITH: Sure.JULIE HYMAN: But just to give a little bit of color on what this company is for those who don't know.BRAD SMITH: All right. Well, next time I'm down there, I got to pop in one.]"

Replicas of her jersey will finally be released by official kit supplier Nike.The sportswear giant came under fire after soccer fans were unable to buy the jersey backing Earps, who eventually took home the Golden Glove from the tournament, the highest individual accolade her position can win.After more than 150,000 supporters petitioned Nike—and Earps criticized the global behemoth herself—it finally listened.Nike has now said it will sell a ""limited number"" of replicas of the Lioness goalkeeper’s jersey—four days after the tournament concluded.“Nike has secured limited quantities of goalkeeper jerseys for England, U.S., France, and the Netherlands to be sold through the Federation websites over the coming days,” a Nike spokesperson said in a statement to Fortune, referring to governing body FIFA’s members.The Oregon-based manufacturer, which supplies and sells merchandise for England’s men’s and women’s national teams, made jerseys for all the outfield players and even the men’s goalkeeper, but left Earps out.She called the move “hugely disappointing and hurtful” in a July interview with The Guardian.Following the World Cup finals last week, which Spain won 1-0, Nike issued a statement saying it was trying to find a solution to sell Earps jerseys. The goalie hit back on Instagram: “@Nike  is this your version of an apology/taking accountability/a powerful statement of intent?”According to Earps, Nike’s decision to not sell the jersey during the tournament undermined the role of goalkeepers in women’s football.Fans’ fight for the Earps jerseyPressure on Nike began building on social media following the final last Sunday when the 30-year-old consolidated her position as a national treasure.On X—formerly known as Twitter—one fan wrote: “My 10-year-old daughter is the goalie in her school team. She’s just gone online to buy a jersey for next year and wanted one like Mary Earps’s only to find Nike don’t do one. ’That’s a bit stupid’ she said. She’s right.”Story continuesMy 10 year old daughter is the goalie in her school team.She’s just gone online to buy a jersey for next year and wanted one like Mary Earps’s only to find Nike don’t do one.“That’s a bit stupid” she said. She’s right, isn’t she @nikefootball @Nike @EnglandFootball— Nick O'Donnell (@gnickodonnell) August 20, 2023Another added: “I still can’t believe Nike refused to print &amp; stock Mary Earps's jersey, she’s in the Fifa Women’s World Cup final &amp; we can’t buy her jersey, absolutely insane.”I still can’t believe Nike refused to print &amp; stock Mary Earps jersey, she’s in the Fifa Women’s World Cup final &amp; we can’t buy her jersey, absolutely insane. #FIFAWWC— Nguvi (@nguvi_) August 20, 2023Top British politicians, as well as fellow pro footballer Beth Mead, also piled in to voice their support for the English goalie.For its part, Nike said it supports and shares “the unprecedented passion and interest” that the women’s tournament received.The company told Fortune it had spent more money on the 2023 iteration than in any global tournament to date, but acknowledged its delay in catering to fans.“We recognize that during the tournament we didn’t serve those fans who wished to show their passion and support to the squad's goalkeepers. We are committed to retailing women’s goalkeeping jerseys for major tournaments in the future,” Nike said.A common issueJerseys for goalkeepers can be expensive for brands to make as the pool of fans is often smaller and the manufacturing process is different from other jerseys.When Nike cited similar reasons, Earps said she had been “fighting behind closed doors” to make her jersey replicas available.Nike lost earnings potential following the exit of the U.S. women's team early in the World Cup, but England's success in making it to the finals helped make up for it.Other women’s national team kit suppliers including Puma and Adidas also didn’t make goalkeeper jerseys, though Denmark's Hummel and Ireland's Castore did see their merch go on sale.Manchester United, the football club Earps plays for, said in a statement Thursday that 'Earps No. 27' jerseys (sold by Adidas) are the second-best-selling women’s replica tee-shirts this season.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

139,d3f49333-22cd-328b-912a-245652037745,WFC,2023-08-26,Wells Fargo-SEC settlement on advisory fees underscores M&A challenges,American Banker,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-sec-settlement-advisory-220859780.html,1693001339,STORY,['WFC'],"[Wells Fargo overcharged nearly 11,000 accounts about $26.8 million in advisory fees from 2002 to 2022, the SEC said. The problem was said to have begun at Wachovia before Wells Fargo bought it in 2008 and was not caught until a decade after the acquisition. Credit: Cooper Neill/BloombergWells Fargo is paying a $35 million fine and nearly $40 million in restitution to settle Securities and Exchange Commission allegations that its investment advice arm overcharged customers for years.The company overcharged nearly 11,000 accounts about $26.8 million in advisory fees over the years, the SEC said in a news release Friday. The overcharging occurred from 2002 to 2022 and is partly connected with its crisis-era acquisition of Wachovia Corp., according to an SEC order outlining the settlement.Wachovia and AG Edwards, an investment firm that Wachovia had acquired just before the crisis, gave certain customers discounts to their standard advisory fees — yet they sometimes failed to enter the discounts into Wachovia billing systems.Wells Fargo did not catch the discrepancies for years after the acquisition, the SEC said, and its advisors continued to offer discounts that weren't reflected in customer billing. The company learned about the issue in 2018 after Connecticut banking regulators asked about it, prompting a review at Wells Fargo that uncovered nearly 11,000 accounts nationwide were overcharged.""Today's enforcement action underscores the need for firms growing their businesses through acquisition to ensure that their growth does not come at the expense of client protection,"" Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in the release.The Wachovia acquisition was far from ideal. It was part of the shotgun marriages of banks during 2008, as troubled mortgage portfolios at Wachovia and elsewhere helped bring the global financial system to its knees.But the deal helped massively extend Wells Fargo's reach and brought Wachovia's expansive advisor network to the San Francisco bank.Wells Fargo didn't have much time to do due diligence on the deal during 2008, noted John Gebauer, chief regulatory officer at the risk advisory firm Comply. ""But they had plenty of time after that transaction to run a smooth integration and to review what they bought,"" Gebauer said.Story continuesThe order highlights the importance of conducting extensive compliance checks on billing and other issues as the advisor industry continues going through a wave of consolidation, Gebauer added.The process that advisors at Wells Fargo and its acquired firms used to offer discounts on preset fees for certain clients stopped in 2014. But some customers who opened up accounts before 2014 continued to be overcharged until last December, the SEC said.In a statement, the company — which did not admit or deny the SEC charges — said it was pleased to resolve the issue.""The process that caused this issue was corrected nearly a decade ago,"" the company said. ""And, as noted in the settlement documents, Wells Fargo Advisors conducted a thorough review of accounts and has fully reimbursed affected customers.""Wells Fargo has reimbursed affected customers more than $26 million from the fees it overcharged and $13 million in interest, the SEC said.The order said that staff had to manually input agreed-upon discounts to a new customer account setup tool, which ""did not automatically populate"" those one-off discounts. That was then transferred to a legacy Wachovia billing system that the order said is still in use today.While Wells Fargo advisors could review the finalized information for discrepancies, the company ""did not have policies or procedures"" that required them to review and confirm the accuracy of charges, the SEC order said. The company did have a quality control process in place from 2009 to 2014 aimed at flagging discrepancies — but it was only for accounts with more than $250,000 when they were opened, the SEC order said.The quality control process spread to smaller accounts starting in 2014, but the company did not do a historical lookback to examine past discrepancies, the SEC said.In Connecticut, where banking regulators first flagged the issue, Wells Fargo found that it overcharged 145 out of more than 57,000 accounts. Most of those dated back to the AG Edwards and Wachovia days.Last year, Wells Fargo began using a tech-enabled process to identify errors for roughly 2.2 million accounts across the country. In all, the bank found it overcharged 10,800 other accounts.The fine is one of a number of penalties the $1.9 trillion-asset company has paid in recent years, some much larger ones tied to consumer-abuse scandals.Last December, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Wells Fargo $1.7 billion for shortcomings in auto loan, mortgage and deposit products. The company also agreed to pay $1 billion to shareholders in May to settle claims that its past leaders were overly optimistic on how quickly it would solve its outstanding issues with regulators.CEO Charlie Scharf, who joined the company in late 2019, has said overhauling the company's risk and control framework remains Wells Fargo's ""top priority and will remain so.""Dan Shaw contributed to this article.]"

149,7abd7daa-d1ac-3f64-b457-ae7c177688ab,PFE,2023-08-26,Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Shares Jump 17% in a Month: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novo-nordisks-nvo-shares-jump-154100109.html,1692978060,STORY,"['NOVO-B.CO', 'LLY', 'NVO', 'PFE', 'JNJ']","[Shares of Novo Nordisk NVO have risen 17.1% in the past month compared with the industry’s 5.0% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis upside is attributable to the company’s popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy (semaglutide).Earlier this month, Novo Nordisk reported positive data from the phase III SELECT study, which evaluated Wegovy as an adjunctive treatment for preventing cardiovascular (“CV”) diseases in adults with overweight or obesity. Data from the study showed that treatment with the drug reduced the risk of major adverse CV events by 20%.This was an encouraging response, as shares have risen consistently following this announcement. Obesity is one of the major risk factors responsible for CV diseases. A weight-loss drug like Wegovy having CV benefits will likely boost the drug’s sales. In addition, the drug would likely become eligible for insurance coverage. Currently, obesity drugs like Wegovy are considered lifestyle drugs and not eligible for coverage under Medicare health plans.Since its launch, sales of Wegovy have been gaining momentum. Wegovy sales were up 543% in second-quarter 2023. The company raised the full-year 2023 sales outlook and profit expectations based on the upside. To further boost the top line, it is also evaluating a once-daily oral formulation of semaglutide for obesity indication in late-stage studies, with a potential FDA filing expected later this year.The FDA also approved semaglutide in 2017 to treat type 2 diabetes (“T2D”), which is being marketed under the trade name Ozempic.However, stiff competition from other pharma bigwigs, like Eli Lilly LLY and Pfizer PFE, is starting to take shape in the global diabetes market for Novo Nordisk.In June, Lilly announced that it had completed the regulatory submission seeking label expansion for its dual GIP/GLP-1-RA drug tirzepatide to treat obesity or overweight in adults. A final decision is expected by 2023-end. While data from one late-stage study (SURMOUNT-1) released last year showed that treatment with the drug led to a mean weight reduction of up to 22.5% in patients without diabetes, data from a second late-stage study (SURMOUNT-2) showed that tirzepatide treatment achieved mean reduction up to 15.7% in T2D patients.Story continuesLilly’s Tirzepatide was approved in May 2022 for treating adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (“T2DM”) and is being marketed under the brand name Mounjaro. Since its launch, Mounjaro has shown an impressive initial uptake, recording $980 million in revenues in second-quarter 2023.An expansion in the obesity indication would help Lilly rake in billions of dollars from Mounjaro sales.Pfizer PFE is also evaluating pipeline candidates for obesity. Currently, Pfizer is lagging behind Lilly and Novartis in terms of development for obesity treatments. This June, Pfizer reported a major setback in its obesity pipeline when it announced its decision to discontinue development of a once-daily oral obesity drug lotiglipron, in favor of a twice-daily orally administered danuglipron. This decision was based on data from multiple phase I drug-drug-interaction studies and an ongoing phase II study wherein study participants treated with lotiglipron were shown to have elevated levels of liver enzymes.Pfizer is currently evaluating danuglipron in a phase II study in patients with obesity and T2DM. If this study is successful, management plans to start phase III studies by year-end.Novo Nordisk A/S Price Novo Nordisk A/S PriceNovo Nordisk A/S price | Novo Nordisk A/S Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Key PickNovo Nordisk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

""The study results provide insights about the real-world risk of stroke and major bleeding associated with switching from apixaban to rivaroxaban in patients with NVAF.""This retrospective study identified NVAF patients who initiated Eliquis or rivaroxaban between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2021 using Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart database. There were 167,868 Eliquis initiators and 65,888 rivaroxaban initiators who met study criteria. Using propensity score matching (PSM), 2,900 patients who switched from Eliquis to rivaroxaban were matched to 14,500 patients who continued Eliquis, and 2,873 patients who switched from rivaroxaban to Eliquis were matched to 14,365 patients who continued rivaroxaban.""Data collected in real-world settings can enhance patient care. By gathering insights from everyday clinical practice, we can better understand how Eliquis is used and its impact on patients’ lives,"" said Narinder Bhalla, MD, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Medical, Head of Cardiovascular and Established Brands at Bristol Myers Squibb. ""This real-world data provides pragmatic information to help clinicians manage the care of their patients.""Story continuesIn this study, switching from Eliquis to rivaroxaban was associated with a higher risk of S/SE (Hazard Ratio (HR):1.99, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.38-2.88) and MB (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.46-2.23) than those who continued Eliquis. Additionally, switching from rivaroxaban to Eliquis was associated with a similar risk of S/SE (HR:0.74, 95% CI: 0.45-1.22) and a lower risk of MB (HR:0.58, 95%CI: 0.44-0.76) compared to those who continued rivaroxaban. It is important to note that anticoagulants, including Eliquis, increase the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal bleeding. Please see important safety information below for Eliquis, including BOXED WARNINGS.Real-world data have the potential to supplement randomized, controlled clinical trial data by providing additional information about how a medicine performs in routine medical practice. Real-world data analyses, however, have important limitations. Observational real-world studies can only evaluate association and not causality, and despite the use of methods to address differences due to measured variables, false associations may still be present. The source and type of data used may limit the generalizability of the results, and varied outcomes are possible.In the ATHENS study, treatment assignments were based on pharmacy claims and actual drug exposure is unknown. Additionally, reasons for switching are not known and sample size for those who switched is much lower than those who continued treatment. Dosing criteria were not evaluated and impacts of drug dosing on outcomes were not assessed. Due to these limitations, real-world data analyses are not used as evidence to validate the efficacy and/or safety of a treatment.About ATHENSThe ATHENS study was designed to assess the risk of stroke/systemic embolism (S/SE) and major bleeding (MB) among Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) patients who switched from Eliquis (apixaban) to rivaroxaban or switched from rivaroxaban to Eliquis instead of continuing initial treatment. This retrospective study identified NVAF patients who initiated treatment between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2021 using a large U.S. administrative claims database. There were 167,868 Eliquis initiators and 65,888 rivaroxaban initiators included in the study.Within both the Eliquis initiators and rivaroxaban initiators cohorts, patients were divided into two groups and compared: switchers to a different direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) within 30 days before or 90 days after discontinuation of the initial DOAC, and continuers, or patients who continued receiving the initial DOAC. The switch date was the index date for those who switched while, for those who continued, a hypothetic index date was randomly assigned based on the distribution of the time from initial DOAC prescription to the switch date in the switchers group. Two final cohorts (switchers and continuers) within Eliquis initiators and rivaroxaban initiators were further propensity score matched (PSM) based on pre-index characteristics using a 1:5 ratio.About Eliquis® (apixaban)Eliquis® is an oral selective Factor Xa inhibitor. By inhibiting Factor Xa, a key blood clotting protein, Eliquis decreases thrombin generation and blood clot formation. Eliquis is approved for multiple indications in the U.S. based on efficacy and safety data from multiple Phase 3 clinical trials. The approval of Eliquis for stroke risk reduction in patients with NVAF is based on data from the Phase 3 ARISTOTLE and AVERROES studies of Eliquis in patients with NVAF. The approval of Eliquis for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy, is based on data from the global AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT studies. U.S. FDA-Approved Indications for Eliquis: Eliquis is a prescription medicine indicated in the U.S. to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF; for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery; for the treatment of DVT and PE; and to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, following initial therapy.Eliquis Important Safety InformationIndicationsEliquis is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.Eliquis is indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery.Eliquis is indicated for the treatment of DVT and PE, and to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy.Important Safety InformationWARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA(A) Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Eliquis, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with Eliquis is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant.(B) Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with Eliquis who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:use of indwelling epidural cathetersconcomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulantsa history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncturesa history of spinal deformity or spinal surgeryoptimal timing between the administration of Eliquis and neuraxial procedures is not knownMonitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary.Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated.CONTRAINDICATIONSActive pathological bleedingSevere hypersensitivity reaction to Eliquis (e.g., anaphylactic reactions)WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONIncreased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Eliquis, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from Eliquis to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If Eliquis is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant.Bleeding Risk: Eliquis increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding.Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding, including aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs.Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue Eliquis in patients with active pathological hemorrhage.The anticoagulant effect of apixaban can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. Please visit www.andexxa.com for more information on availability of a reversal agent.Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture: Patients treated with Eliquis undergoing spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture may develop an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of Eliquis. The next dose of Eliquis should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of Eliquis for 48 hours.Monitor patients frequently and if neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Physicians should consider the potential benefit versus the risk of neuraxial intervention in Eliquis patients.Prosthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of Eliquis have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is not recommended in these patients.Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy: Initiation of Eliquis is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS): Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including Eliquis, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive APS. For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti–beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with Eliquis were related to bleeding.TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONSEliquis should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. Eliquis should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be noncritical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping Eliquis and prior to the intervention is not generally required. Eliquis should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.DRUG INTERACTIONSCombined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of bleeding. For patients receiving Eliquis doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose of Eliquis by 50% when Eliquis is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir). In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of Eliquis with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.ClarithromycinAlthough clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggest that no dose adjustment is necessary with concomitant administration with Eliquis.Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of Eliquis with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) because such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban.Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo.PREGNANCYThe limited available data on Eliquis use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform drug-associated risks of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse developmental outcomes. Treatment may increase the risk of bleeding during pregnancy and delivery, and in the fetus and neonate.Labor or delivery: Eliquis use during labor or delivery in women who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia may result in epidural or spinal hematomas.Consider use of a shorter acting anticoagulant as delivery approaches.LACTATIONBreastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Eliquis.FEMALES AND MALES OF REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIALFemales of reproductive potential requiring anticoagulation should discuss pregnancy planning with their physician. The risk of clinically significant uterine bleeding, potentially requiring gynecological surgical interventions, identified with oral anticoagulants including Eliquis should be assessed in these patients and those with abnormal uterine bleeding.Please see U.S. FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION, including Boxed WARNINGS, available at www.bms.com.About the Bristol Myers Squibb-Pfizer CollaborationThe Bristol Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance (the Alliance) is committed to driving education and awareness about atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE).

It is also approved for active immunization of individuals 60 years of age and older for the prevention of LRTD caused by RSV.The EU approval was based on data from two pivotal phase III studies called RENOIR and MATISSE on the candidate.Older adults, young infants and people with some chronic medical conditions are at maximum risk of getting LRTD-RSV disease. RSV is a contagious disease and a common cause of respiratory illness globally. The RSV disease causes approximately 245,000 hospital admissions in children and 270,000 hospitalizations among older adults yearly in Europe. The RSV vaccines are expected to reduce these infant and older adult hospitalizations this year.Earlier this week the FDA approved Abrysvo to help protect infants through maternal immunization in the United States. Abrysvo was approved for older adults in the United States in May.In June, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also recommended Abrysvo for use in older adults aged 60 and older. The CDC’s recommendation for Abrysvo for use in pregnant mothers is awaited.With the latest approvals, Pfizer’s vaccine has become the first maternal immunization vaccine to be approved to help protect infants at first breath through their first six months of life from RSV disease in the United States as well as the EU.Pfizer is the only company with an RSV vaccine to help protect older adults and infants through maternal immunization in both the United States and EU.Story continuesPfizer’s stock has declined 29.4% so far this year against an increase of 8.1% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research In May, the FDA approved GSK’s GSK RSV vaccine, Arexvy, forthe prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in older adults aged 60+ years.

Based on an interim data analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, Welireg showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared to everolimus, in the study. Though a favorable trend was observed in the study’s other primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”), it did not reach statistical significance. The study investigators will test the OS endpoint at a subsequent analysis.The LITESPARK-005 study also achieved its secondary endpoint of statistically significant improvement in the objective response rate. Welireg/belzutifan, Merck’s novel HIF-2α inhibitor, is presently approved to treat some von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors.Roche’s Accidental Disclosure of Cancer Combo Study Data: Roche was made aware of the inadvertent disclosure of data from its second interim analysis of the late-stage SKYSCRAPER-01 study. The study is evaluating the combination of Roche’s investigational anti-TIGIT drug tiragolumab plus blockbuster PD-L1 drug Tecentriq (atezolizumab) compared to Tecentriq monotherapy, as a first-line treatment for patients with PD-L1-high locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.Per the data readout, the results for the primary endpoint of OS were not mature at the time of the second interim analysis. It was observed that the median OS for the tiragolumab/Tecentriq combo arm was estimated at 22.9 months, while that in the Tecentriq monotherapy arm was 16.7 months. The difference in the OS in the two arms yielded a hazard ratio of 0.81. A high hazard ratio likely suggests that the tiragolumab-Tecentriq combination was more effective than treatment with Tecentriq alone. Roche intends to continue this study until the final analysis of data.AstraZeneca’s Lynparza and Soliris Get Approvals for Expanded Use in Japan: AstraZeneca and partner Merck announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has granted approval to Lynparza for expanded use in prostate cancer.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can go to 5 Most Innovative Companies in Finance.Innovation brings diverse implications for a consumer, business, industry, and other markets. Financial innovation comprises a process that introduces new financial products and services. Technological evolution has made groundbreaking advancements for every industry. For instance, Artificial Intelligence is being used in semiconductors, biotechnology, travel and transport, and banking and financial services, among others. AI is creating efficiency for these industries and allowing companies to have access to broader markets. Such digital technologies have guided investors, borrowers, and businesses to save capital in the financial services industry. Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) is one of the leading American banks that is using data and technology to enhance its services. The CIO at Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF), Rob Alexander while talking to Fortune said:“Beginning in 2012, we sought to completely redefine who we are as a company—to operate like a bank that a technology company would build.You could say that we have been focused on data and technology ever since our founding days as a company.Machine learning, AI, and real-time data are central to how we build our products and services for customers and to how we run our company. Through machine learning, we can proactively serve contextually relevant, personalized information and insights for customers through our mobile app—helping them to get the most out of their money.”Market Outlook The global economy has been under pressure since the COVID-19 pandemic. China’s reopening has boosted the regional economy and positively impacted global trade. Morgan Stanley in its Economic Outlook 2023 mentioned that China is expected to report GDP growth of 5.7% in 2023 and 4.9% in 2024. Whereas global GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.9% this year and continue the same momentum to 2.8% in 2024. In addition, the U.S. and Europe are expected to avoid recessions next year as the central banks continue to overcome slow inflation. The U.S. unemployment is around its lowest point since 1968 and core inflation is higher than it was in 1983. As reported by Morgan Stanley, Chief U.S. Economist Ellen Zentner believes that the Fed will hold its policy rate at 5.1% and begin quarterly cuts of 0.25% in early 2024. The economic strain in 2023 has put funding pressures on the banking system. For the U.S., Morgan Stanley projects annual GDP growth of 1.2% for this year and 0.8% in 2024. Story continuesOn July 11, J.P. Morgan Research shared the midyear market outlook for 2023. J.P. Morgan pointed out that due to Fed tightening, front-end Treasury yields had soared 25 basis points by July 26. The Fed tightening cycle is approaching an end, but J.P. Morgan expects limited room for yields to drop in the second half of 2023. The Co-Head of U.S. Rates Strategy at J.P. Morgan, Jay Barry said:“Even though inflation has moderated in recent months, it remains uncomfortably high, and we forecast that the Fed will be on hold through the second quarter of 2024. While rates have historically declined once the Fed goes on hold, we think the descent this time is going to be a bit more gradual than it’s been in the past. Also, we think central bank balance sheet policy is likely to be a headwind to lower yields, while other less price-sensitive sources of demand for Treasuries should remain weak.”J.P. Morgan has hinted that central banks in developed markets are expected to continue their tightening policy. However, in the coming months, the policy rates in developed markets should help in taking inflation near the target in accordance with central bank forecasts. In that premise, J.P. Morgan expects a much more relaxed monetary policy in 2023.  Investors might be interested in markets considering a delay in recession until 2024. Despite a slightly positive outlook, the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) plunged to a 17-month low at the end of May, and is down by -7.72% year to date, as of August 23. Russell Investments is positive on government bonds and believes enthusiasm around AI can support stocks in the near term. However, the headwinds are building up for the long term. President &amp; Chief Investment Officer at Russell Investments, Kate El-Hillow, while sharing the Q3 2023 global market outlook stated:“Equity markets have been melting up post the debt-ceiling resolution and banking fears subsiding in the U.S. Pair that with AI enthusiasm, still plenty of cash on the sidelines and resilient economic growth, and we can see a path where stocks are supported in the near-term as the economy continues to slow down, slowly.Despite that, we see risk skewed to the downside. As a result, we are more neutrally positioned and keeping an eye on key indicators, including the impact of liquidity coming out of the markets. We still think a recession is likely, but it may be delayed until 2024, with potential tipping points linked to increased pressure on corporate profits and households eating through $500 billion in excess savings.While markets could move upward during the second half of the year, today’s markets demonstrate why it is important for investors to have a strategic plan. Many of our current discussions with clients center around cutting through the noise and focusing on the strategic decisions that need to be made now to keep them invested in this still-challenging market. It is important for us to be thoughtful and patient about making portfolio changes, taking into account various inputs including cycle, value, and sentiment drivers and portfolio-specific considerations.” Emergence of Financial Institutions Financial markets have developed over the years and today modern financial technologies are the driving forces in the financial segment. Some seven hundred years ago The Bank of Venice was established which was a stepping stone for the modern banking system. In 1407, Banco di San Giorgio was founded which was one of the oldest chartered banks in Europe. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A. (BIT:BMPS) is the oldest serving bank as of today, which was established in 1472. It is a leading Italian bank with notable market shares in all segments of the bank’s operations. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A. (BIT:BMPS) is focused on conventional retail and commercial banking services. The Italian bank is active across the country and major international financial markets with a core focus on households and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Retail and commercial banks provide services to the end users and have been a key part of the financial system over the years. The central banks are the regulatory body of the banking system in each government that controls the entire banking system. The oldest central bank in the world is Sweden’s Sveriges Riksbank and The Bank of England is the second oldest central bank in the world. The central bank plays the main role in designing a country's monetary policy and is backed by the state governments. Modern Day FinanceThe system that was introduced by the old financial institutions is still followed today by the biggest finance companies in the world. However, with the evolution of technology and the Internet, the banking system has also evolved. Digital banking is the modern way for banks to operate online and provide services through internet or mobile app banking. Technological progress and innovation are key to the development of financial institutions. For financial services firms, it is important to industrialize innovation. According to Ernst &amp; Young, 87% of financial firms are investing in innovation as the top priority. The executives at financial institutions consider innovation as a top agenda item. We can imagine how innovation has been the key to the financial sector in recent times. The fact that innovation is widely viewed as critical to achieving consumer demands, understanding technology-driven disruption, and engaging with new players in the market, including fintechs. Fintechs are at the forefront of technological advancement in the financial services industry. According to McKinsey, AI, blockchain, cloud computing, and IoT are some of the key technologies that will drive fintech development over the next decade. Crypto and Web3 are two of the emerging technologies in the fintech world. COVID-19 was one of the main catalysts that uplifted the growth of fintechs. Due to lockdowns, fintech firms dominated transaction volume and growth in advanced economies compared to emerging markets and developing economies. However, digital payments were higher for firms in emerging markets and developing economies. According to a study conducted by the World Economic Forum, one of the major reasons for the rise of fintech companies during the pandemic was the presence of regulatory support. Some of the leading companies that are shaping the fintech future include Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME).Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is the second largest cryptocurrency exchange based on trading volume. Blockchain companies are making the payment method easier compared to conventional banking methods. Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is investing in promising crypto and Web3 projects to create a crypto empire. On August 21, Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) announced that it is investing in Circle Internet Financial to increase its support for stablecoins. Both companies will have a commercial partnership, where Circle will be controlling USDC issuance and governance. Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) will be launching USD Coin (USDC) on six new blockchains during the fourth quarter of 2023. The companies will close Centre Consortium, a jointly managed operator of USDC. ""With growing regulatory clarity for stablecoins in the U.S. and around the world, the requirement of a separate governance body like Centre, is no longer needed"", said Coinbase in a blogpost.With the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) became one of the first financial services companies to embrace crypto assets. Recently, on August 7, PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced the launch of its own U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). PayPal USD is backed by 100% U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. PayPal Holdings Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PYPL) CEO, Dan Schulman stated:“The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar.""CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), the operator of one of the world's largest derivatives marketplace, is offering a platform for investors to efficiently hedge their crypto assets. On August 16, CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) said it plans to launch two new APAC-specific reference rates for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on September 11. CME is making it easier for its Asia-Pacific clients to understand the crypto market more accurately and precisely to hedge their cryptocurrencies.Now that we have taken a look at what is happening in the finance world, let's take a look at the most innovative companies in finance.15 Most Innovative Companies in FinanceOur MethodologyTo obtain data for the most innovative companies in finance, we looked into different publications that had ranked top finance and fintech companies.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:9.7% = US$2.2b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10.Does International Business Machines Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, International Business Machines has a lower ROE than the average (16%) in the IT industry.roeThat's not what we like to see. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books.  Our risks dashboard should have the 4 risks we have identified for International Business Machines.Story continuesThe Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining International Business Machines' Debt And Its 9.7% Return On EquityInternational Business Machines does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.57. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: International Business Machines may not be the best stock to buy.

One such stock that merits attention is The AES Corp (NYSE:AES). The stock, currently priced at $18.02, recorded a gain of 1.66% in a day and a three-month decrease of 9.03%. The stock's fair valuation is $27.46, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AES. Click here to check it out.

The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is The AES (AES) a Hidden Value Trap? Unraveling the Risks and RewardsIs The AES a Potential Value Trap?Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with The AES Corp should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.54. These indicators suggest that The AES, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreInvented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany Snapshot: The AES CorpThe AES Corp is a global power company. Its current generation portfolio as of year-end 2022 consists of over 32 gigawatts of generation including renewable energy (46%), gas (32%), coal (20%), and oil (2%). AES has majority ownership and operates six electric utilities distributing power to 2.6 million customers.Is The AES (AES) a Hidden Value Trap? Unraveling the Risks and RewardsAnalyzing The AES's Low Altman Z-ScoreThe EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of The AES's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.03; 2022: 0.01; 2023: 0.03) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that The AES might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.Conclusion: Is The AES a Value Trap?Despite the attractive valuation of The AES Corp, the low Altman Z-score and the declining trend in the EBIT to Total Assets ratio suggest potential financial distress. Therefore, it seems that The AES might indeed be a value trap. As always, investors should conduct thorough due diligence before making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Or a new diner for Guy Fieri to review in his Food Network show? Well, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s vision for a drive-in diner and movie theater is getting one step closer to becoming a reality.A couple years back, Musk had teased he was working on a grand idea for a Supercharger location in Santa Monica. In a tweet he said, “Major new Supercharger station coming to Santa Monica soon! Hoping to have 50’s diner &amp; 100 best movie clips playing too. Thanks Santa Monica city!”According to Tesla news site Teslarati, it seems Tesla has received approval from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety to build this new Supercharger hangout, not in Santa Monica, but in West Hollywood, just east of the initial location. (No word on opening date.)Tesla had said recently that the drive-in movie theater and diner location would have 32 Supercharger stalls, two movie screens, and a restaurant with rooftop seating. Back at its Investor Day in early March, the company also shared a rendering of what this Supercharger location would look like (below).Elon's fever dream? A rendering of Tesla's diner and drive-in theater Supercharger location. (Tesla) (Tesla)Big business: As of this spring, Tesla had more than 17,000 individual Superchargers in the United States, across approximately 2,000 stations. Tesla has said there are Supercharger stations in all 50 states. Depending on the success of this location, Tesla may build out more of these deluxe stations in marquee locations in cities like Los Angeles.Not to be forgotten are Tesla’s big moves in the charging space with other automakers. The company will include EVs from the likes of GM (GM), Ford (F), Mercedes (MBGAF), Rivian (RIVN), and Volvo (VOLCAR-B.ST) in the Supercharger network starting in 2024. (Owners of these vehicles may be able to use this enhanced West Hollywood location too, but that information is not available at this time.)Tesla’s deals with other automakers allow them to use 12,000 of Tesla’s Supercharger stalls, meaning not all locations and stalls will be available to non-Tesla owners.Story continuesTesla’s Supercharger business was once considered just a perk for Tesla owners — the company may have been running network as a break-even or loss-producing business just to maintain a competitive edge in the EV space.Now with big charging deals in place with major automakers, Wall Street analysts, among others, are starting to see the Supercharger network as its own standalone business. In a report published this morning, analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush said the Supercharger network could generate $10 billion-$20 billion in revenue by 2030, or roughly 3-6% of Tesla’s total revenues.Tesla isn’t the only company with its own charger network. Mercedes, Rivian, and Porsche (POAHY) have announced plans for their own charging locations, which will include amenities like dining, shopping, and relaxation spots for users. Rivian, through its adventure network, plans to have its own chargers at destinations like national parks and heavily trafficked outdoor adventure locations.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

While hotel prices have risen in the U.S., airfare and rental car prices are down over 10 percent from 2022, according to a new report from Hopper. Hayley Berg, Hopper Lead Economist, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the state of the economy, holiday travel, and how consumers can get the best deals.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, millions of people are expected to travel for Labor Day weekend next week. And a new report shows you may be getting a cheaper deal. Though hotel prices in the US have risen slightly from last year, airfare and rental car costs are both down over 10% from 2022. That's according to a new report from Hopper.And Hayley Berg, Hopper lead economist, is joining us now to talk through it. So we obviously have seen some moderating prices across the economy. I got to say, I was a little surprised by the moderating prices in airfares in particular because, A, we know there's still a lot of demand. And B, anecdotally, it doesn't feel like those prices have come down. So where is that pressure sort of letting up?HAYLEY BERG: We hear that so often. We're quoting these low prices. But consumers don't feel like they're seeing them. And part of that is some behavioral changes. People are planning trips much more last minute than they did prepandemic, meaning they're missing out on some of the best and lowest prices.But domestic prices are really down driven by the higher supply the airlines are operating at the end of the summer this year, a much earlier peak in summer demand. We saw the majority of folks taking trips in June, July, and early August.So we've entered that low-demand period about a week or two earlier than we have in previous years. All of that is gonna drive airfare down for Labor Day weekend in particular, comes at the end of the summer. It's not always the highest demand long weekend of the summer. And that's really why we're seeing about 225 for airfare down about $75 from what we saw earlier this summer and 4th of July weekend.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: It's really interesting. And as we think about travelers getting ready to perhaps make those flights, catch them, some of them might miss them. That's unfortunate. At the same time, the airlines, are they better equipped now at the end of the summer to really deal with the influx, the volume of demand that they're gonna see?HAYLEY BERG: I would say airlines every day since really the end of 2021 have been increasingly better equipped, better trained to handle the volume of passengers that we're seeing. There was a huge influx of new hiring in 2022. Those people had to be trained. And it's not just the airlines, it's the airports as well. It's the FAA, air traffic control, TSA.So we had a relatively successful summer. We did not see the incredibly high disruption rates we did in 2022. But it is a fact that disruption rates are higher now than they have been. You know, prepandemic, about 25% of flights delayed on departure, between 1% and 2% canceled. That still impacts thousands of passengers a day.JULIE HYMAN: Does it dissuade them from traveling, though, Hayley? I mean, and I take that also with the report that recently came out, I believe, in ""The New York Times"" talking about how many near misses there are because of our air traffic control system. Do we see any kind of hit to travelers sentiment as a result of all of this?HAYLEY BERG: We haven't seen it on the Hopper app. Most of our users are Gen Z, millennials, so they definitely are more focused on travel than some of the older generations have historically been. The most interesting thing we're seeing, though, is that about one in five of our users are paying extra, a little more than $30 additional to buy a disruption protection product when they check out with their flight.That's something that allows them to rebook for free on the next available flight if they're canceled, delayed, or miss a connection. And that right there shows us that though travelers are price conscious-- they continue to check the price of trips many times before they book-- they are prepared to pay a little extra for peace of mind in case they are canceled or have a major disruption in their trip.BRAD SMITH: Are people upgrading? And beyond just buying protection, are they upgrading their experience even after that initial purchase?HAYLEY BERG: We always see travelers upgrading, whether it is selecting seats, moving to a higher cabin class. That's something that's been persistent even since prepandemic. If anything, we've seen the airlines start to make some strategic changes to capture more of this premium demand, expanding their premium, seat selection spaces, in some cases, even removing first class to expand business or premium. So there is definitely a lot of demand for premium out there. But when we poll our users, getting the best price and getting an affordable trip remains their number one priority even ahead of anything like more legroom.]"

It is well documented that air travel demand is particularly strong on the leisure front. What is more encouraging is that international demand made a roaring comeback.The decline in fuel expenses represents another tailwind for the industry.Driven by the abovementioned positives, investors interested in the industry would do well to keep stocks like Ryanair Holdings RYAAY, United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL on their radar.About the IndustryThe Zacks Airline industry players are engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Their operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers. Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy. For example, the aviation space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a beating. However, air travel demand is extremely rosy now. The focus on boosting cargo revenues is a positive too.Factors Relevant to the Industry's FortunesRosy Air Traffic Scenario: The stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from pandemic lows is a huge positive for the industry, which was one of the worst hit in the peak COVID-19 period. The removal of COVID-related restrictions is aiding air travel, which is now strong on the international front as well. Reflecting the recovery in air travel demand, overall global traffic was up 47.2% in the first half compared with the year-ago period, with double-digit increases on both the domestic and international fronts, per IATA.Story continuesPeople are again resorting to air travel as they resume their normal activities. Expecting the strong passenger volumes to continue, some airline companies like United Airlines have lifted their earnings per share view for the current year.Declining Fuel Costs: The southward movement of oil price bodes well for the bottom-line growth of industry participants. This is because fuel expenses are a significant input cost for the aviation space. Notably, oil price declined 6.6% in the April-June period of 2023. Per IATA, the average jet fuel cost is expected to be $98.5 per barrel in 2023 (earlier forecast was $111.9 per barrel).High Labor Costs: Increased operating costs are limiting bottom-line growth. With expenses on fuel moving south, costs will likely continue to be steep going forward due to escalated labor costs. Moreover, as U.S. airlines grapple with pilot shortage, the bargaining power of this labor group has increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked in the space. This is resulting in a spike in labor costs. American Airlines recently lifted its forecast for third-quarter non-fuel unit costs due to the four-year pay-related deal with pilots.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Airline industry is a 28-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #74, which places it in the top 29% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate for 2023 has moved up 27.3% since March 2023.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to add or retain in your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 But Outperforms SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry has gained 5.8% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composite’s rise of 6%. The broader sector has declined 3.4% in the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceValuation PictureThe price/sales (P/S) ratio is often used to value airline stocks. The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/S of 0.44X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.71X. It is also below the sector’s forward-12-month P/S of 1.62X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.02X, as low as 0.33X and at the median of 0.64X.Forward 12-Month Price-to-Sales Ratio (Past Five Years)3 Stocks to Keep a Tab onRyanair Holdings’ growth prospects are being supported by an upbeat air travel demand scenario. Upbeat passenger volumes are leading to the company posting impressive traffic numbers over the past few months.Measures to expand its fleet to cater to the rising travel demand are encouraging as well. Riding on the buoyant air-traffic scenario, RYAAY shares have gained 31% year to date. RYAAY surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters by 21.4%.

But instead of generating hype, citing shrink softens the blow of sinking profits.The most prominent mention of shrink in recent weeks came from Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS).On a call with analysts following its Aug. 22 earnings report, CFO Navdeep Gupta said, ""The biggest impact in terms of the surprise for Q2 primarily came from shrink."" Gupta went on to say, ""The number of incidents and the organized retail crime impact came in significantly higher than we anticipated."" The company cut its full-year profit outlook in response.The theme of missing merchandise also featured in recent calls from Dollar Tree (DLTR), Macy's (M), Home Depot (HD), and Target (TGT).Dick's Sporting Goods profit slipped in its second quarter and missed Wall Street's expectations as the retailer cut its full-year profit outlook, citing worries over theft at its stores. (Seth Wenig/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Analysts say the trend reflects a real problem for retailers, and one that they are taking steps to prevent.""Nobody wants to come out and say, 'We are not in control,'"" said David Johnston, NRF vice president of asset protection and retail operations. ""To see the number of CEOs coming out and talking about shrink and loss — it's an issue.""Dollar Tree, for instance, told investors it is installing locked cases on more items and even taking some SKUs out of stores in response to elevated theft. ""We are now taking a very defensive approach to shrink,"" Dollar Tree CEO Rick Dreiling told analysts this week.And as executives continue to hammer on the industry-wide threat coming from shrink, the concept has gathered momentum and can work as a crutch for explaining weaker financial performance.""There is a bandwagon effect here,"" said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData. ""When one retailer starts to call something out, others will look at it. And because everyone is interested in it, that fuels more mentions of theft.""Story continuesGrowing 'shrink'But data suggests that behind a new industry-wide excuse for business slowing down is an uptick in theft and increasing concerns for safety.Retailers say that shrink amounted to $94.5 billion in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation’s (NRF) annual of survey of companies, up from $90.8 billion in 2020. As a percentage of sales, however, that figure came out to about 1.4% of sales, down from 1.6% in 2020.Retailers also reported a 26.5% increase in organized retail crime incidents, when groups of professional shoplifters steal and resell stolen goods. While the latest figures are nearly two years old, sustained commentary from executives suggests that shrink is a growing problem for them.Jonathan Simon, a criminal justice professor at UC Berkeley School of Law, said businesses probably do have relatively accurate estimates of how much their inventory is shrinking due to theft. And that it's possible retail theft has increased partially because of online resale platforms, which serve as a conduit for organized theft for profit.""But businesses also have an incentive to place more emphasis on theft as it shifts the responsibility for business shrinkage — never a good look to investors or customers — to an abstract but blameworthy factor like organized crime,"" he said.The public also has a tendency to place all retail theft in the same category, he added, lumping together organized theft, survival theft by unhoused or very poor people, and teenagers and younger adults acting out by stealing. ""Each of these really needs to be seen as distinct problems with distinct solutions.""A Nordstrom department store at the Grove mall in Los Angeles, where a smash-and-grab robbery drew attention to organized retails thefts. (Jae C. Hong/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Beyond the 'smash and grab'The dramatic crime figures and sensationalized videos that have drawn broader public attention have also invited criticism that the problem might be overblown.In a widely covered backtrack, Walgreens CFO James Kehoe said earlier this year that the pharmacy chain ""cried too much"" about theft on a prior earnings call that was among the first to ignite concerns about retail crime.But retail industry experts insist this quarter's references to shrink aren't merely executives crying wolf.Janine Stichter, a research analyst covering consumer retail and lifestyle platforms at BTIG, said citing shrink figures isn't something that you can fake for very long.Stichter sees the timing of shrink's big moment in earnings calls, which picked up at the end of last year, as coinciding with price increases and a weaker economic environment, highlighting a link between crime and a tougher economy.Under the strain of higher costs, consumers squeezed by inflation, and shifts in shopping habits, the industry faces a host of challenges even without the pain and risks of theft.""Shrink is clearly an issue, but so is the tremendous volatility that the consumer and retail has experienced over the last nearly four years,"" said Ethan Chernofsky, senior vice president of marketing at Placer.ai, a location analytics firm.""The pandemic presented a unique set of circumstances and just when we expected a period of normalcy as the pandemic's effects faded, a wide array of economic challenges disrupted retail 'normalcy.'""Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) shareholders have enjoyed a 59% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 43% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 41%.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Intuitive Surgical managed to grow its earnings per share at 11% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 10% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Intuitive Surgical's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Intuitive Surgical shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 41% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 10%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

The company has placed more than 8,000 da Vinci systems in hospitals worldwide, with nearly 5,000 installations in the U.S. and a growing number in emerging markets. The company's stock price stands at $293.69, while its GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $358.26. This discrepancy paves the way for a profound exploration of the company's value.Is Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on historical multiples, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.Intuitive Surgical's stock is estimated to be modestly undervalued based on GuruFocus' valuation method. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value calculation, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $ 293.69 per share, Intuitive Surgical stock is estimated to be modestly undervalued. As Intuitive Surgical is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesIs Intuitive Surgical Inc.

(ISRG) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-isrg-considered-133005408.html,1692970205.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 61.9% and 9.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for ISRGBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ISRGCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Intuitive Surgical, Inc. here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Intuitive Surgical, Inc., but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is ISRG a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Intuitive Surgical, Inc., the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $5.56.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(ISRG) Worth Betting on Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-intuitive-surgical-130007891.html,1692968407.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this company have returned -11.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.8% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. belongs, has lost 10.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.56 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.45 indicates a change of +16% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.77 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $7.13 billion and $8.16 billion estimates indicate +14.7% and +14.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.4%. EPS of $1.42 for the same period compares with $1.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.35%. The EPS surprise was +7.58%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

185,85d5472c-80fa-322e-a30f-d6c2bca93de6,SBAC,2023-08-26,Here's Why SBA Communications (SBAC) is an Apt Portfolio Pick,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-sba-communications-sbac-131100866.html,1692969060,STORY,"['SBAC', 'T']","[SBA Communications Corporation SBAC owns an extensive wireless communications infrastructure portfolio globally. The company is likely to capitalize on the increased capital spending by wireless carriers to expand their networks amid accelerated 4G and 5G network deployment efforts. Also, its expansion efforts and solid balance sheet strength bode well.This July, this Boca Raton, FL-based communications tower REIT reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of $3.24, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14. Moreover, the figure increased 5.5% from the prior-year quarter.Management raised its outlook for 2023. It now expects AFFO per share in the range of $12.80-$13.16, up from the prior guided range of $12.55-$12.91. Analysts, too, seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 AFFO per share has been raised 1.4% over the past month to $12.86.Shares of the company have lost 5.2% in the quarter-to-date period compared with the industry’s decline of 3.6%. However, given the rise in wireless connectivity usage and the secular trends of the industry, there is immense scope for growth, and SBAC is expected to perform well in the quarters ahead. Hence, this marks a good entry point in the stock now.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors That Make SBA Communications a Solid PickHealthy Industry Fundamentals: The advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services has fueled the rise.This has led to greater capital spending by wireless carriers to meet this incremental demand, aiding demand for SBAC’s wireless communication infrastructure. With wireless consumer demand likely to shoot up considerably in the upcoming years, SBAC remains well-positioned to benefit from this trend. We expect a 3.1% increase in the company’s 2023 total revenues.Resilient Site-Leasing Business Model: The company has a resilient and stable site-leasing business model as it generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with built-in rent escalators. This assures stable site-leasing revenues for the company. In the second quarter of 2023, 89% of the total incremental domestic leasing revenues came from the big four carriers — AT&amp;T, Inc. T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Dish.Moreover, in late July 2023, SBAC signed a new five-year master lease agreement with AT&amp;T. The deal will help AT&amp;T deploy 5G and other advanced technologies by leveraging SBAC's vast U.S. tower portfolio, benefiting both companies.We expect 2023 site-leasing revenues to increase 7.1% year over year.Expansion Efforts: SBA Communications’ portfolio expansion efforts into select international markets with high growth characteristics position it well to take advantage of the secular trends in mobile data usage and wireless spending growth across the globe.Notably, in October 2022, it acquired 2,632 sites from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for roughly $725 million in cash. The recent 5G spectrum options in Brazil position SBA Communications well to benefit from the transaction.Further, in the second quarter of 2023, the company acquired nine communication sites for a total cash consideration of $7.2 million. It also built 64 towers during this period. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, SBAC purchased or is under contract to buy 134 communication sites for a total consideration of $72.9 million in cash. It expects to conclude these buyouts by the end of this year.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: SBAC is focused on maintaining a healthy balance sheet position with ample liquidity. As of Jun 30, 2023, it had $273.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments. Also, during the second quarter, its net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially to 6.6X from 6.9X. As of Jul 31, 2023, the company had $360 million outstanding under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. With ample financial flexibility, SBAC is well-poised to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Also, the company’s current cash flow growth is projected at 14.77% compared with the industry’s average of 9.37%.Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders, and SBA Communications has remained committed to that. In February 2023, it announced a quarterly cash dividend of 85 cents per share on its Class A common stock, representing a hike of 20% from the prior payout of 71 cents. Moreover, it has increased its dividend four times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 24.19%. Such efforts enhance shareholders’ wealth and boost investors’ confidence in the stock.

186,c0a466f9-0f41-3558-8e24-71f77ca5bcb0,RF,2023-08-26,Here's What We Like About Regions Financial's (NYSE:RF) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-regions-financials-nyse-rf-121722022.html,1693052242,STORY,['RF'],"[Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Regions Financial's shares before the 31st of August to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.24 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.96 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Regions Financial has a trailing yield of 5.2% on the current share price of $18.54. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Regions Financial Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Regions Financial's payout ratio is modest, at just 34% of profit.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, Regions Financial's earnings per share have been growing at 19% a year for the past five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Regions Financial has lifted its dividend by approximately 37% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Regions Financial? Companies like Regions Financial that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Regions Financial more closely.In light of that, while Regions Financial has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Regions Financial that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Of course, the downbeat month and the recent stretch of volatility are not pleasant in the moment. But pullbacks are healthy and vital parts of the stock market and one was desperately needed after the huge rally.The market swung between solid gains and losses through early afternoon trading on Friday as Wall Street attempted to make sense of Jay Powell’s Jackson Hole speech and its impact on near-term price action. Stocks then surged higher once again near the end of the session.The Fed chair continued to stay the course, saying the central bank is “prepared to raise rates further if appropriate,” while aiming to “proceed carefully.” Various headlines pointed to different snippets. The Fed boss also said that inflation was still “too high” and that they intend to “hold policy at a restrictive level” until prices cool even more.Powell was never going to declare victory with core inflation still solidly above the Fed’s floating target range. And investors should be pleased the Fed isn’t growing complacent since slightly higher rates for longer is a far better scenario than rebounding inflation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTaking a giant step back, August has been a historically bad month for the stock market over the last 30 or so years. More importantly, the downturn this time around was also very much needed to help cool things off after the huge rally. Plus, S&amp;P 500 earnings are projected to grow by double digits in both 2024 and 2025.The foundation that drove the market comeback is still in place. Investors with long-term horizons who can block out the near-term noise might want to consider buying proven large cap stocks and holding them for the long haul. The three stocks we explore today are Caterpillar (CAT), Walmart (WMT), and Visa (V).Story continuesCaterpillar (CAT) and its iconic yellow machines are the titans of the construction and mining sector, and business is booming. Caterpillar is benefitting from the ongoing surge in construction spending in the U.S. and it is set to benefit over the next decade-plus from the U.S. government-backed push for infrastructure spending, reshoring, and beyond.CAT topped our Q2 estimates in early August and boosted its guidance, with it projected to post massive top and bottom-line growth this year. Caterpillar’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. Meanwhile, CAT’s dividend tops its highly-ranked industry’s average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar stock has more than doubled the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years, with it also up 230% in the past 10 years vs. the benchmark’s 170%. CAT stock has surged 40% in the last year. The stock is trading around 7% below its recent highs and still above its 50-day moving average. Plus, Caterpillar’s valuation is appealing at the moment, trading 60% below its 10-year highs, nearly 20% below its median, and 15% beneath the Zacks Industrial sector at 13.4X forward 12-month earnings.Walmart (WMT) topped our quarterly estimates and boosted its guidance once again on August 17 as shoppers of all income levels continue to hunt for the best prices. WMT’s upbeat EPS outlook helps it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Zacks estimates call for its overall revenue to climb 5% this year and 4% higher next year to help lift its adjusted earnings by 2% and 9%, respectively.Walmart offers every form of delivery and pick-up possible and its subscription service is helping it better compete against Amazon (AMZN). The company is also actively expanding its digital advertising segment, pushing forward its automation frontiers, and more to help it thrive in the coming decades.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWMT stock has climbed 65% over the last five years vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 53%, and Amazon’s 36%. Walmart hit new highs earlier this month, with it now trading about 13% below its average Zacks price target, as it floats around its 50-day moving average. And it trades at a 14% discount to its own 10-year highs at 23.2X forward 12-month earnings.Visa Inc. (V) is a credit card powerhouse that remains influential in the U.S. and around the world despite all of the ‘disruptions’ from fintech. Visa operates an extensive and powerful payment and processing network and it takes a piece of the endless number of credit card payments in a world that is growing more cashless every day. Visa’s constant and never-ending role in the economy shows up in its consistent and impressive revenue expansion.  Visa beat our earnings and revenue estimates in late July as it has every quarter for the last five years. Visa’s EPS outlook has improved slightly since then, though it sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. Zacks estimates call for Visa to expand its bottom line by 15% this year and another 13% higher next year on the back of 11% and 10% higher revenue.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisa shares have climbed 450% in the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 240%. Visa stock has stalled out a bit over the last three years, with it currently neck and neck with Tech, up around 16%. Visa is trading around 10% below its average Zacks price target. And Visa trades 35% under its peaks and slightly below its decade-long median at 24.8X 12-month forward earnings. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 3.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Western Union due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Western Union Q2 Earnings Beat on High C2C TransactionsWestern Union reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 51 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 34.2%. The bottom line remained flat year over year.Total revenues rose 3% year over year on a reported basis or 6% on a constant-currency basis to $1,170 million. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.8%.The quarterly results were supported by growth in business originating from Iraq, Argentinian inflation and better-than-expected C2C transactions. Evolve 2025’s momentum and strength in the Middle East business further benefited the results, partially offset by higher expenses.Q2 PerformanceAdjusted operating margin of 21.8% deteriorated 150 basis points year over year due to increased incentive compensation, variable costs, currency impacts and investments in Evolve 2025 strategy. However, the adjusted operating margin beat our estimate of 18.4% as the negatives were partially offset by reduced marketing spend and savings from the redeployment program of operating expenses.Second-quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16% was lower than 16.9% in the year-ago period.Western Union’s total expenses came in at $927.4 million, up 6% year over year and 8.9% higher than our estimate. Higher cost of services and SG&amp;A expenses contributed to this increase in the second quarter.C2C SegmentThe C2C segment reported revenues of $1,072.2 million, which increased 4% year over year and beat our estimate of $950.4 million in the quarter under review, on the back of higher transactions. Operating income climbed 2% year over year to $230.7 million, beating our estimate of $158.4 million. Changes in Iraqi monetary policies also provided an impetus. The operating income margin of 21.5% fell from 22% a year ago.Story continuesTransactions within the C2C segment rose 4% year over year to 70.6 million, marking the highest growth since 2021 and beating our estimate of 63.5 million, on the back of its branded digital go-to-market program strength. Furthermore, higher transactions across the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, Latin American and Caribbean region and North America boosted the metric in the second quarter, partially offset by lower Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States transactions.Branded Digital revenues decreased 2% on a reported basis and constant-currency basis.

(V) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-trending-stock-130010123.html,1692968410,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +2.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has lost 2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share, indicating a change of +15.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.65 points to a change of +15.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.76 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $8.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The $32.6 billion and $35.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.2% and +10.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $8.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.7%. EPS of $2.16 for the same period compares with $1.98 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.72%. The EPS surprise was +2.37%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa.

193,fbaafa62-c0d9-35bb-9983-9e024c590741,MAR,2023-08-26,Marriott International's (NASDAQ:MAR) investors will be pleased with their favorable 98% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-internationals-nasdaq-mar-investors-143630222.html,1692974190,STORY,['MAR'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), which is up 95%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 19% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 23% , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Marriott International While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Marriott International was able to grow its EPS at 88% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 25% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Marriott International has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Marriott International, it has a TSR of 98% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Marriott International shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 10% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Marriott International better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Marriott International  that you should be aware of.But note: Marriott International may not be the best stock to buy.

Axios Media Deals Reporter Tim Baysinger joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what this means for the sports streaming landscape.As customers continue cutting the chord and moving to streaming services, ""it makes sense that sports is moving over"" as well, Baysinger says. ""In terms of how to figure out the future of ESPN, I mean, Disney has been very open that they are looking for some kind of strategic partner,"" Baysinger says. Baysinger explains that Disney has ""held talks with multiple different companies"" including the NBA, NFL, and MLB, ""so they’re clearly looking far and wide for someone to help them with this full-streaming version of ESPN.""Baysinger notes that ""a full-streaming version of ESPN is going to be easily the most expensive, you know, streaming service on the market."" ""Sports rights are not cheap, they’re only going to get more expensive"" and with ESPN’s sports deals, ""their costs are only going up,"" Baysinger says.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Amazon is reportedly in talks with Disney for a potential streaming partnership with ESPN. The information reporting that the two companies have discussed pricing for the service with Amazon exploring a minority stake in the sports network. So what does this all mean for the sports streaming landscape?Here to discuss, we've got Axios Media Deals Reporter Tim Baysinger. Tim, was this a surprise? It seems to make sense given the sports offerings Amazon already has.TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah, it's-- in some ways, it's not much of a surprise. Because, I mean, if you look at a lot of the recent reports and that in terms of how to figure out the future of ESPN, I mean, Disney has been very open that they are looking for some kind of strategic partner.They've held talks with multiple different companies. They've held talks with every single professional league, the NBA, the NFL, Major League Baseball, the NHL, obviously, Amazon. They've held talks with Verizon. So they're clearly looking far and wide for someone to help them with this full streaming version of ESPN.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: And, Tim, when you think about pricing especially we've seen some data recently about some of the churn that's happening as people kind of get subscription fatigue over all these subscriptions and where ESPN may end up being, the potential cost now, the potential cost if it's rolled up into Amazon, what are you hearing about pricing especially when you think about subscription shock?TIM BAYSINGER: I mean, it's fair to assume that a full streaming version of ESPN is going to be easily the most expensive streaming service on the market. I mean, you've seen the numbers. It could be anywhere, but they're-- currently, they're talking between $20 and $35 a month which is well more expensive than pretty much anything else out there.And obviously, the current version of ESPN's streaming service ESPN+, I mean, that's only like $5 a month, and they're making far less money off those subscribers versus the people that subscribe to ESPN on cable television. So a full version of ESPN streaming service is going to have to cost a lot more, because sports rights are not cheap. They're only going to get more expensive.ESPN not only is going to probably renew its NBA deal, that's up in a few years, it has its SEC football deal that's going to start pretty soon. So their costs are only going up.AKIKO FUJITA: Tim, it really-- things have really moved quickly when it comes to sports and streaming. Obviously, Amazon's had that deal with the NFL. You've got Apple with the MLB as well as MLS. What's the verdict so far, you think? I mean, for so long it was about-- the only reason to keep cable, to keep that cord was sports. And we've seen a lot of those move over to the streaming side.TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah, I mean, that was-- I would say about five or six years ago, that was the kind of talk you always heard was that sports were the one thing that was kind of holding the pay-TV bundle together. And while sports, especially the NFL, still get big viewership, it's turned out that people are still cutting the cord and moving to streaming, dropping their cable subscriptions. So it makes sense that sports is moving over to streaming.Now, I would describe what's happening as more of-- it's a lot of experimentation. I mean, the reason that Thursday Night Football went to Amazon was because it was on CBS, it was on NBC, it was on Fox before, and none of those networks really did that well with it, because, one, it had to be simulcast on NFL Network.And so it's really on Amazon. Because, frankly, a lot of the broadcast networks that have been NFL partners for years, they didn't really want it.DIANE KING HALL: And, Tim, I want to ask you. Akiko mentioned Apple. I know there had been talk about Apple potentially kind of bringing ESPN to its fold. Have you heard any recent talk of that especially when you think about what's happening now with Amazon?TIM BAYSINGER: I haven't heard that talk, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was happening because, as I said before, it really looks like Disney is talking to everybody in terms of how to help with ESPN. I mean, Disney CEO Bob Iger in their earnings call a few weeks ago, he mentioned one of the key things that they're looking for when talking for a strategic partner with ESPN is someone to help with distribution. Obviously, Amazon, Apple really kind of makes sense in a lot of those ways.AKIKO FUJITA: What do you think this means ultimately? And we should preface this by saying this is a report from the information. Disney hasn't necessarily come out and said, yes, we're teaming up with Amazon. But when you see where sports is moving in the streaming landscape, what does that ultimately mean for the viewing experience moving forward?Sure, we're used to sort of channel-hopping on sort of the traditional TV. But this is about subscription streaming services that viewers will need access to.TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah, I think you're going to see sports moving into this kind of bifurcation where more games are actually going to be on broadcast television. I've talked to my sources that are involved and have knowledge of the NBA's discussions that they're having is they want more games to be on ABC versus ESPN in the next deal.And what you're going to happen is you're going to see a lot of games, a lot of big ticket games move closer to broadcast. You're seeing it on the local side with some NBA teams like the Utah Jazz and the Phoenix Suns and in the NHL with the Vegas Golden Knights. They're taking their local television rights away from cable and moving them to broadcast.At the same time, there's this other wing that's going to be subscription whether that's some subscription companies or some streaming companies that are going to simulcast what's on broadcast television or you're going to see what's happening with the NFL and Amazon, or more specifically, the MLS and Apple which kind of went to a-- they'll have some games on Fox this season, but they're mostly going to a full subscription streaming model with Apple.And I think, big picture, what you're seeing is a lot of these leagues are going to be faced with this decision that used to not be a decision which is you can either get-- you can either reach the biggest audience, or you can make the most money. I don't think any more you can do both.AKIKO FUJITA: It'll be interesting to see how that all pans out, but it's good to get your take today. Tim Baysinger with Axios, appreciate your time.]"

Over the last six months, Disney shares have fallen 17% against a 9% gain for the S&amp;P 500.Disney has faced a slew of recent challenges that have dampened investor sentiment. The company's parks business is slowing. Its linear TV division is declining, and so are subscribers to its flagship streaming service Disney+. Not to mention the media giant seems to have lagged competitors at the box office.Some on Wall Street are advocating for a breakup, suggesting Disney should consider unloading unprofitable or ""non-core"" assets.A new report from The Information late Thursday said the company is in early talks with Amazon (AMZN) to help bring ESPN fully over the top as a direct-to-consumer streaming platform.The tech behemoth could offer ESPN through one of its streaming services, which would help boost its distribution, the report said. It's also possible Amazon could take a minority stake in the sports network.ESPN declined to comment on the report, while Disney and Amazon did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request.Disney is reportedly weighing a cost between $20 and $35 a month for the service, The Information said. That would be the highest-priced streaming platform on the market, which would debut at a time when more subscribers are canceling their streaming plans to combat rising costs.But analysts and media watchers have cautioned ESPN's full transition to streaming will be a difficult journey, particularly when it comes to the high costs of sports rights and consumers footing the bill for an additional streaming service versus watching sports as part of the cable bundle.Story continuesA new report from The Information said Disney is in early talks with Amazon to help bring ESPN fully over the top as a direct-to-consumer streaming platform (David Kohl/AP Photo, File)An 'expansive look'CEO Bob Iger last month said the company would take an ""expansive"" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, signaling the potential for strategic options that could include a sale.""Given the thinking you've done about the future of Disney, why doesn't it make sense to create two Disney companies: one focused on parks, Disney+, and then the studio IP that drives that flywheel, and then one on everything else? So why not make a clean break?""

The company is facing continued turmoil due to issues such as the falling profitability of linear television and dwindling theme park attendance. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down how Disney plans to recover from these challenges.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Disney closed at its lowest level in almost nine years yesterday as the company looks to implement a turnaround plan, including price hikes and cost cutting. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now with the breakdown. Hey, Alex.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, guys. Yeah, not a good time to be a Disney shareholder. And I wanna repeat that-- the lowest level in nearly nine years. October 17, 2014, the stock closed at that point, $82.68. That's actually a little better than what we saw shares close at on Thursday night, down 4%, trading at $82.47.If we look at shares right now, they are actually up about 1% but still below that critical $84 mark. And, uh, if we compare that to the S&amp;P 500 as well, Disney has underperformed the broader market, declining nearly 5% year-to-date compared to the S&amp;P's roughly 15% gain. And this comes amid a lot of challenges for this company.We have a parks business that is declining. We have subscriber losses. We have linear TV challenges. And there's a lot of uncertainty here as Bob Iger really tries to reset the tone and the future of this business.He's suggested that, perhaps, linear networks aren't core to the business. And they're exploring strategic options that could include a sale. We also have ESPN taking that fully over the top in the background, the information reporting that Amazon and Disney are currently in talks. And when you hear that, and you think about the future of this company, analysts have wondered, is Disney too big at this point? Do you split it up?And who's in that conversation? The FAANG names. We have the Apples, the Amazons of the world that could potentially come in there and gobble up some of those parts of the business. So a lot going on on top of the leadership problems.Story continuesWe don't have a permanent CFO. We don't know who will replace Iger at the end of the day. So I just think this murky future is having investors take a-- take a step back a bit.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, so there's a lot of hypotheticals in here, a lot of hypotheticals.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Uh-huh.JULIE HYMAN: If-- it could maybe do this and that.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes.JULIE HYMAN: What concrete steps do investors expect the company to take to maybe help the stock in the short to medium term?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think it's been pretty much set that ESPN is going to be fully over the top as a direct-to-consumer streaming service. We don't know the pricing of that. The information said that Disney is exploring between $20 to $35 a month. Now, that would be one of the highest, uh, streaming services on the market at a time when consumers are leaving and abandoning their plans due to higher prices across the board.And when you take a look at the landscape right now, all of the streaming giants really want to boost engagement. What boosts engagement? Sports and live news. That's what analysts have told me. That's why you saw Warner Brothers Discovery launch CNN Max, that 24-hour news, uh, section. Now, we'll see if that--JULIE HYMAN: You mean CNN+?ALEXANDRA CANAL: It's basically the rebrand--JULIE HYMAN: 2.0?ALEXANDRA CANAL: --of CNN+, yes. But that's a bid for engagement. It might not lead to a subscriber boost. But it's going to keep people on the platform longer. And sports has long been viewed as that as well.So, uh, I think that is one of the things that investors are really hinging their bets on moving forward. But in terms of everything else, you're right. The-- it could go a zillion different directions. So it's one of those companies we're just gonna have to continue to track.BRAD SMITH: All right, era of spinning teacups for Disney over there.]"

Specifically, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s third-quarter financial report for fiscal 2023 showed a 4% increase in revenue to $22.3 billion. In stark contrast to the $0.77 in earnings from the same quarter last year, the company recorded a loss of $0.25 per share from continuing operations. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, a small 5.5% decrease from the prior year.Disney+ subscribers fell, while the direct-to-consumer (DTC) sector increased revenue and cut operating losses. Utilizing well-known brands and franchises, investigating a seamless one-app experience, and considering options like sending ESPN's primary channels straight to customers are all part of the strategy.Strategic Goals and ReorganizationRestoring creativity, being cost-effective, and meeting evolving expectations are the main goals of the plan. The business also places a focus on profitability in its streaming division with the launch of Disney+, which is ad-supported, and bundled subscription choices.Story continuesThe reorganization strategy implemented by The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) over the past eight months under the direction of CEO Bob Iger strives to solve issues brought on by shifting customer tastes and market dynamics.Nevertheless, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is well-positioned for long-term success in the entertainment industry thanks to its tenacity in the parks, experiences, and products area and dedication to innovation.Why The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) Could Be An Interesting Turnaround CaseThe Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) can be considered a turnaround stock due to several factors:Disney+ Turnaround: Despite facing losses initially to establish Disney+, the direct-to-consumer segment's operating loss has narrowed significantly. The company anticipates the segment's profitability by the end of the following year. Cost controls and price increases for streaming services indicate a positive trajectory.Resilience in Movie Studios: The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) remains dominant in the film industry, with several high-grossing films in 2023. Its global appeal has enabled movies like Elemental to thrive internationally despite modest U.S. box office performance.CEO's Extended Tenure: The contract extension for CEO Bob Iger provides a more extended timeframe for executing the turnaround strategy. This allows for better asset management, long-term improvements, and succession planning.Thriving Theme Parks: Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s theme parks business continues to excel. Revenue and operating income remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Expansions in international resorts further contribute to growth prospects.Attractive Valuation: The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s stock is trading at historically low valuations. The projected earnings multiple for the upcoming fiscal year is only 17 times, which drops to just 10 for fiscal 2027. The increasing streaming service prices align with industry trends and signal improved profitability.Industry Recovery: The transition from traditional media to streaming has impacted the industry, making media stocks less attractive. However, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s strategic price increases and market leadership position it well for a potential recovery.Historic Premium: The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) has historically commanded a market premium, and its current lower valuation could offer an opportunity for investors seeking a turnaround play. The company's reputation and potential for profit growth contribute to its appeal.While challenges remain, these factors suggest that The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s strategic initiatives and growth potential could position it as a turnaround stock with future upside potential.Unveiling The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s Stock Valuation Amidst Triumphs and TrialsThe Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s stock valuation presents a complex picture marked by both positive strengths and challenges. On the positive side, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) boasts a powerful position in the entertainment industry with a unique combination of assets including theme parks, film studios, a vast content library, and a rapidly growing streaming business.While The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s stock has faced significant declines, it remains a dominant force in the media and entertainment industry. Most of the difficulties it faces are shared by its competitors, suggesting that these issues are industry-wide rather than exclusive to The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). The potential for The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) to reestablish itself as a growth-focused company and a top blue chip stock is a realistic prospect, though it may take a few years to fully materialize.Investment Opportunities and ValuationGiven its historical strengths and long-term opportunities, the current valuation of The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s stock, trading at 22.4x times forward earnings, could be an attractive entry point for long-term investors who believe in its ability to rebound over time.Favorably, DIS is currently trading at a significant discount to its intrinsic value of $160.56, and with a current price of $82.47 is well below the analyst's target price of $109.38, indicating potential upside for investors. The P/E ratio of 67.05 suggests that the stock may be overvalued compared to its earnings, but the P/S ratio of 1.72.Disney At A 9-year Low, Should You Buy?TakeawayAmid challenges, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s strength in parks, experiences, and innovation persists. Turnaround factors include Disney+'s narrowing losses, movie industry dominance, extended CEO tenure, thriving theme parks, attractive valuation, and industry recovery potential.The road to recovery is not without challenges, as evidenced by the recent box office and streaming setbacks. Ultimately, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s ability to communicate and execute its turnaround strategy, as well as navigate the evolving entertainment landscape, will play a critical role in determining its future trajectory.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, a small 5.5% decrease from the prior year.Disney+ subscribers fell, while the direct-to-consumer (DTC) sector increased revenue and cut operating losses. Utilizing well-known brands and franchises, investigating a seamless one-app experience, and considering options like sending ESPN's primary channels straight to customers are all part of the strategy.Strategic Goals and ReorganizationRestoring creativity, being cost-effective, and meeting evolving expectations are the main goals of the plan. The business also places a focus on profitability in its streaming division with the launch of Disney+, which is ad-supported, and bundled subscription choices.Story continuesThe reorganization strategy implemented by The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) over the past eight months under the direction of CEO Bob Iger strives to solve issues brought on by shifting customer tastes and market dynamics.Nevertheless, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is well-positioned for long-term success in the entertainment industry thanks to its tenacity in the parks, experiences, and products area and dedication to innovation.Why The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) Could Be An Interesting Turnaround CaseThe Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) can be considered a turnaround stock due to several factors:Disney+ Turnaround: Despite facing losses initially to establish Disney+, the direct-to-consumer segment's operating loss has narrowed significantly. The company anticipates the segment's profitability by the end of the following year. Cost controls and price increases for streaming services indicate a positive trajectory.Resilience in Movie Studios: The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) remains dominant in the film industry, with several high-grossing films in 2023. Its global appeal has enabled movies like Elemental to thrive internationally despite modest U.S. box office performance.CEO's Extended Tenure: The contract extension for CEO Bob Iger provides a more extended timeframe for executing the turnaround strategy. This allows for better asset management, long-term improvements, and succession planning.Thriving Theme Parks: Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s theme parks business continues to excel. Revenue and operating income remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Expansions in international resorts further contribute to growth prospects.Attractive Valuation: The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s stock is trading at historically low valuations. The projected earnings multiple for the upcoming fiscal year is only 17 times, which drops to just 10 for fiscal 2027. The increasing streaming service prices align with industry trends and signal improved profitability.Industry Recovery: The transition from traditional media to streaming has impacted the industry, making media stocks less attractive. However, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s strategic price increases and market leadership position it well for a potential recovery.Historic Premium: The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) has historically commanded a market premium, and its current lower valuation could offer an opportunity for investors seeking a turnaround play. The company's reputation and potential for profit growth contribute to its appeal.While challenges remain, these factors suggest that The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s strategic initiatives and growth potential could position it as a turnaround stock with future upside potential.Unveiling The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s Stock Valuation Amidst Triumphs and TrialsThe Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s stock valuation presents a complex picture marked by both positive strengths and challenges. On the positive side, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) boasts a powerful position in the entertainment industry with a unique combination of assets including theme parks, film studios, a vast content library, and a rapidly growing streaming business.While The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s stock has faced significant declines, it remains a dominant force in the media and entertainment industry. Most of the difficulties it faces are shared by its competitors, suggesting that these issues are industry-wide rather than exclusive to The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). The potential for The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) to reestablish itself as a growth-focused company and a top blue chip stock is a realistic prospect, though it may take a few years to fully materialize.Investment Opportunities and ValuationGiven its historical strengths and long-term opportunities, the current valuation of The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s stock, trading at 22.4x times forward earnings, could be an attractive entry point for long-term investors who believe in its ability to rebound over time.Favorably, DIS is currently trading at a significant discount to its intrinsic value of $160.56, and with a current price of $82.47 is well below the analyst's target price of $109.38, indicating potential upside for investors. The P/E ratio of 67.05 suggests that the stock may be overvalued compared to its earnings, but the P/S ratio of 1.72.Does Disney Have Value at 9-Year Low?TakeawayAmid challenges, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s strength in parks, experiences, and innovation persists. Turnaround factors include Disney+'s narrowing losses, movie industry dominance, extended CEO tenure, thriving theme parks, attractive valuation, and industry recovery potential.The road to recovery is not without challenges, as evidenced by the recent box office and streaming setbacks. Ultimately, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s ability to communicate and execute its turnaround strategy, as well as navigate the evolving entertainment landscape, will play a critical role in determining its future trajectory.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, M&amp;T Bank investors that purchase the stock on or after the 31st of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.20 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, M&amp;T Bank stock has a trailing yield of around 4.1% on the current share price of $125.58. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately M&amp;T Bank's payout ratio is modest, at just 30% of profit.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see M&amp;T Bank's earnings per share have risen 15% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. M&amp;T Bank has delivered an average of 6.4% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayHas M&amp;T Bank got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. In summary, M&amp;T Bank appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.In light of that, while M&amp;T Bank has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for M&amp;T Bank that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

218,095c7be6-71cd-3eab-a80c-8dc54f6aeb7b,CMCSA,2023-08-26,"Amazon, Disney discussing ESPN streaming deal: Report",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-disney-discussing-espn-streaming-202622848.html,1692995182,VIDEO,"['WBD', 'AAPL', 'DIS', 'NFLX', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'CMCSA', 'AMZN']","[Amazon (AMZN) and Disney (DIS) are in early talks about a potential ESPN streaming partnership, according to a report from the Information. Axios Media Deals Reporter Tim Baysinger joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what this means for the sports streaming landscape.As customers continue cutting the chord and moving to streaming services, ""it makes sense that sports is moving over"" as well, Baysinger says. ""In terms of how to figure out the future of ESPN, I mean, Disney has been very open that they are looking for some kind of strategic partner,"" Baysinger says. Baysinger explains that Disney has ""held talks with multiple different companies"" including the NBA, NFL, and MLB, ""so they’re clearly looking far and wide for someone to help them with this full-streaming version of ESPN.""Baysinger notes that ""a full-streaming version of ESPN is going to be easily the most expensive, you know, streaming service on the market."" ""Sports rights are not cheap, they’re only going to get more expensive"" and with ESPN’s sports deals, ""their costs are only going up,"" Baysinger says.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Amazon is reportedly in talks with Disney for a potential streaming partnership with ESPN. The information reporting that the two companies have discussed pricing for the service with Amazon exploring a minority stake in the sports network. So what does this all mean for the sports streaming landscape?Here to discuss, we've got Axios Media Deals Reporter Tim Baysinger. Tim, was this a surprise? It seems to make sense given the sports offerings Amazon already has.TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah, it's-- in some ways, it's not much of a surprise. Because, I mean, if you look at a lot of the recent reports and that in terms of how to figure out the future of ESPN, I mean, Disney has been very open that they are looking for some kind of strategic partner.They've held talks with multiple different companies. They've held talks with every single professional league, the NBA, the NFL, Major League Baseball, the NHL, obviously, Amazon. They've held talks with Verizon. So they're clearly looking far and wide for someone to help them with this full streaming version of ESPN.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: And, Tim, when you think about pricing especially we've seen some data recently about some of the churn that's happening as people kind of get subscription fatigue over all these subscriptions and where ESPN may end up being, the potential cost now, the potential cost if it's rolled up into Amazon, what are you hearing about pricing especially when you think about subscription shock?TIM BAYSINGER: I mean, it's fair to assume that a full streaming version of ESPN is going to be easily the most expensive streaming service on the market. I mean, you've seen the numbers. It could be anywhere, but they're-- currently, they're talking between $20 and $35 a month which is well more expensive than pretty much anything else out there.And obviously, the current version of ESPN's streaming service ESPN+, I mean, that's only like $5 a month, and they're making far less money off those subscribers versus the people that subscribe to ESPN on cable television. So a full version of ESPN streaming service is going to have to cost a lot more, because sports rights are not cheap. They're only going to get more expensive.ESPN not only is going to probably renew its NBA deal, that's up in a few years, it has its SEC football deal that's going to start pretty soon. So their costs are only going up.AKIKO FUJITA: Tim, it really-- things have really moved quickly when it comes to sports and streaming. Obviously, Amazon's had that deal with the NFL. You've got Apple with the MLB as well as MLS. What's the verdict so far, you think? I mean, for so long it was about-- the only reason to keep cable, to keep that cord was sports. And we've seen a lot of those move over to the streaming side.TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah, I mean, that was-- I would say about five or six years ago, that was the kind of talk you always heard was that sports were the one thing that was kind of holding the pay-TV bundle together. And while sports, especially the NFL, still get big viewership, it's turned out that people are still cutting the cord and moving to streaming, dropping their cable subscriptions. So it makes sense that sports is moving over to streaming.Now, I would describe what's happening as more of-- it's a lot of experimentation. I mean, the reason that Thursday Night Football went to Amazon was because it was on CBS, it was on NBC, it was on Fox before, and none of those networks really did that well with it, because, one, it had to be simulcast on NFL Network.And so it's really on Amazon. Because, frankly, a lot of the broadcast networks that have been NFL partners for years, they didn't really want it.DIANE KING HALL: And, Tim, I want to ask you. Akiko mentioned Apple. I know there had been talk about Apple potentially kind of bringing ESPN to its fold. Have you heard any recent talk of that especially when you think about what's happening now with Amazon?TIM BAYSINGER: I haven't heard that talk, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was happening because, as I said before, it really looks like Disney is talking to everybody in terms of how to help with ESPN. I mean, Disney CEO Bob Iger in their earnings call a few weeks ago, he mentioned one of the key things that they're looking for when talking for a strategic partner with ESPN is someone to help with distribution. Obviously, Amazon, Apple really kind of makes sense in a lot of those ways.AKIKO FUJITA: What do you think this means ultimately? And we should preface this by saying this is a report from the information. Disney hasn't necessarily come out and said, yes, we're teaming up with Amazon. But when you see where sports is moving in the streaming landscape, what does that ultimately mean for the viewing experience moving forward?Sure, we're used to sort of channel-hopping on sort of the traditional TV. But this is about subscription streaming services that viewers will need access to.TIM BAYSINGER: Yeah, I think you're going to see sports moving into this kind of bifurcation where more games are actually going to be on broadcast television. I've talked to my sources that are involved and have knowledge of the NBA's discussions that they're having is they want more games to be on ABC versus ESPN in the next deal.And what you're going to happen is you're going to see a lot of games, a lot of big ticket games move closer to broadcast. You're seeing it on the local side with some NBA teams like the Utah Jazz and the Phoenix Suns and in the NHL with the Vegas Golden Knights. They're taking their local television rights away from cable and moving them to broadcast.At the same time, there's this other wing that's going to be subscription whether that's some subscription companies or some streaming companies that are going to simulcast what's on broadcast television or you're going to see what's happening with the NFL and Amazon, or more specifically, the MLS and Apple which kind of went to a-- they'll have some games on Fox this season, but they're mostly going to a full subscription streaming model with Apple.And I think, big picture, what you're seeing is a lot of these leagues are going to be faced with this decision that used to not be a decision which is you can either get-- you can either reach the biggest audience, or you can make the most money. I don't think any more you can do both.AKIKO FUJITA: It'll be interesting to see how that all pans out, but it's good to get your take today. Tim Baysinger with Axios, appreciate your time.]"

On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues increased courtesy of sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.Moreover, URI has lifted its guidance for 2023, given the strength of the present market condition and the multi-year tailwinds the company sees across infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy and power.Also, it unveiled a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with an annualized yield of approximately 1.3%. The company also repurchased $500 million of stock year to date under its existing $1.25 billion share repurchase program.Inside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings of 9.88 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.23 by 7%. The reported figure increased by 25.7% from the prior-year figure of $7.86 per share.Total revenues of $3.55 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $3.43 billion by 3.5% and grew 28.3% year over year.Rental revenues increased 21.1% from the year-ago quarter to $2.98 billion. This upside was mainly attributable to broad-based demand growth across end markets served by the company. Also, Ahern Rentals buyout contributed to the growth. However, fleet productivity was down 2%, but average original equipment costs increased by 25.5% year over year.Used equipment sales rose 132.9% from a year ago. The Used equipment sales produced an adjusted gross margin of 57.3%, which contracted 490 basis points (bps). This downside was due to the expected normalization of channel mix, including the expanded use of wholesale channels, and the impact of sales of equipment acquired in the Ahern Rentals acquisition.Story continuesSegment DiscussionGeneral Rentals: This segment registered 22.5% year-over-year growth in rental revenues to $2.19 billion. Rental gross margin contracted 270 bps year over year to 36% due to the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition.Specialty: Segmental rental revenues increased 17.3% year over year to $792 million. Rentals’ gross margin expanded 240 bps on a year-over-year basis to 48.6%.

Free cash flow, including merger and restructuring-related payments, dropped 13.3% year over year to $340 million for the quarter due to higher net rental capital expenditures.2023 Guidance RaisedTotal revenues are expected to be in the range of $14-$14.3 billion versus $13.7-$14.2 billion projected earlier. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $6.75 billion and $6.9 billion compared with the prior projection of $6.6-$6.85 billion.Net rental capital expenditure after gross purchases is projected within $1.9-$2.1 billion (versus the prior expectation of $2-$2.25 billion), indicating a decrease from $2.471 billion in 2022.Net cash provided by operating activities is anticipated to be in the range of $4.5-$4.8 billion (compared with $4.4-$4.8 billion expected earlier), suggesting a rise from $4.433 billion in 2022.

224,e49bfd14-9bf4-304b-b6e1-44500cab8aed,MU,2023-08-26,US Commerce chief heading to China with aim of boosting business ties,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-commerce-chief-heading-china-140152428.html,1692972112,STORY,"['BA', 'MU']","[By David Shepardson and Trevor HunnicuttWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visits China for four days starting Sunday, aiming to boost business ties between the world's largest two economies even as the Biden administration has taken a series of steps to prevent exports of sensitive American technology.Raimondo has repeatedly said the United States does not want to ""decouple"" from China, but also noted she has aggressively placed Chinese companies on an export control list.""There’s a lot of benefit to doing business (with China) where we can. Having said that, we have to protect what we must, and be eyes wide open about the threats and strategic competition,"" Raimondo said in July.Tensions are high as the United States works with allies to block China's access to vital equipment needed to keep its chip industry competitive and Beijing restricts shipments from prominent U.S. firms like planemaker Boeing and chip company Micron Technology.Ahead of Raimondo's arrival in Beijing on Sunday, several recent announcements from the U.S. have likely pleased Chinese officials. On Tuesday, China welcomed the U.S. decision to lift export control restrictions on 27 Chinese entities, saying it is conducive to normal trade between Chinese and U.S. firms.And on Wednesday the United States said it is seeking a six-month extension to a decades-old science and technology agreement with China, a deal Chinese officials have expressed a desire to extend.The two biggest economies in the world used to be each other's largest trade partners, but Washington is now trading more with neighboring Canada and Mexico, while Beijing is trading more with Southeast Asia.The visit comes after a blitz of intense diplomacy over several months by U.S. President Joe Biden’s top aides aimed at easing tensions between Washington and Beijing.Officials are hoping to see concrete signs of progress in the relationship, in potential areas ranging from trade to climate, in time for a potential face-to-face meeting between Biden and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping before the end of the year.Story continuesThe semiconductor chip industry is eager to protect its profits in China as the Biden administration considers another round of restrictions on chip exports to China. Last year, China accounted for $180 billion in semiconductor purchases, more than a third the worldwide total of $555.9 billion and the largest single market, according to Semiconductor Industry Association.Raimondo in May said the United States ""won't tolerate"" China's effective ban on purchases of Micron memory chips and is working closely with allies to address such ""economic coercion.""Raimondo said in July the Biden administration is seeking to carefully target U.S. controls on exports to China, but rules will cost firms some revenue.Restrictions should not be so broad ""that you deny American companies revenue and China can get the product elsewhere, or China can get the product from other countries,"" Raimondo said. Rules ""will deny some revenue to American companies, but we think it's worth it.""One big open question is when will China resume deliveries of Boeing 737 MAX passenger jets. Raimondo, who has spoken to Boeing executives on numerous occasions, said in 2021 the Chinese government was preventing its domestic airlines from buying U.S.-manufactured Boeing airplanes.""There's tens of billions of dollars of planes that Chinese airlines want to buy, but the Chinese government is standing in the way,"" she said.Raimondo’s trip may be the last face-to-face interaction between top U.S. officials and their Chinese counterparts ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris’ Sept. 4-7 trip to the ASEAN meetings of Southeast Asian countries, Biden’s Sept. 7-10 trip to India for the Group of 20 meetings and the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations later in September.On the sidelines of those meetings, Biden and Harris are expected to spend time wooing neighboring countries anxious about China’s assertive posture in the Indo-Pacific and declining economy.(Reporting by David Shepardson and Trevor Hunnicutt; editing by Jonathan Oatis)]"

You can skip our analysis of the global economic power dynamics, and head over directly to the 10 Most Economically Powerful Countries in the World.As the old adage goes, there is no free lunch. Large and prosperous economies around the world have used development assistance, or simply foreign aid, as a foreign policy tool to expand their national interests. While in doing so they have without doubt contributed to improving human welfare, but the primary motive behind channeling billions of dollars to weaker, developing countries has always been to receive something back in return. Aid has been used to reward friendly countries for their compliant policies, and aid has been withdrawn to destabilize nations with antagonistic regimes.Abubacarr Tambadou, Gambia’s Justice Minister in 2020 took Aung San Suu Kyi to the world court in The Hague over the persecution faced by Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, but it is hard to conceive that an African country would seek to do the same with any Chinese leader over the happenings in Xinjiang province with Uyghurs, primarily due to hefty development aid a number of African countries receive from China. Pakistan pulled out of the 2019 summit of Muslim nations hosted by Malaysia after Saudi Arabia and UAE expressed reservations about Islamabad joining the meeting, which they felt could rival the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Both of these countries host large Pakistani expatriate communities and have repeatedly assisted Pakistan in times of financial distress.Similarly, powerful countries have also used foreign investments as a means of pursuing foreign policy goals by expanding their cultural influence. Due to the size and strength of their economies, these countries are home to some of the world’s largest corporations with funds available to expand geographically. One much talked about example in the last century has been the global expansion of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). After American troops went overseas for World War II, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) vowed to make Coke available for the soldiers wherever they were and began building bottling stations on the Western Front and the Pacific.Story continuesAfter the war was over, the company started expanding its operations across Europe and Asia, and that marked the beginning of a concept that came to be known as ‘coca-colonization’ – a term that signified the Americans pushing forward their ideals in areas under their sphere of influence. In 1948, the French government openly stood against the drink and even accused The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) of being an espionage network. As of 2015, Coca-Cola is distributed in more than 200 countries. Coca Cola is considered to be the second-most commonly understood word in the world after ‘okay’ according to the company's website.Another brand that rode the coattails of America’s economic and cultural dominance is Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI). It is hard to imagine any garment today that is as widely embraced and worn across the world as jeans are. First designed in the 19th century by Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI) for laborers, jeans, despite gaining popularity in the decades that followed, were worn only in the western states of the US till World War II. Soon the trend caught up among middle class Americans and started to gain popularity in Europe as well where American soldiers often wore Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI)’s jeans when they were off duty. Jeans represented symbols of democratization and a happy, prosperous American way of life for the Europeans.Fast food culture is also widely seen as a representation of American marketing dominance. Brands such as McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM)'s KFC and Pizza Hut have thousands of outlets around the world today. China has the most Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM)’s KFC restaurants in the world. India is the second largest market for Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) after the United States, while China and Japan race to claim second spot for the most McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) outlets by country.MethodologyWe have ranked the 30 most economically powerful countries in the world using two metrics: nominal GDPs of these countries in 2022 and the average foreign aid given by these nations to developing countries between 2020 and 2022. Data measuring the size of the GDP has been sourced from the IMF, while OECD's Net ODA Database and other reliable and independent sources were studied to get figures related to the foreign aid these countries gave out. Equal weightage has been given to both metrics and then summed to get an aggregated score. We have listed countries in this article in ascending order of those scores.30 Most Economically Powerful Countries in the WorldS-F/Shutterstock.comLet’s now head over to the list of the most economically powerful countries in the world.30.

Shares have added about 4.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Seagate due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Seagate Q4 Loss Narrower Than ExpectedSeagate reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP loss of 18 cents per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.59 in the year-ago quarter.Management expected non-GAAP earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter to be 20 cents per share (+/- 20 cents).Non-GAAP revenues of $1.602 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%. The figure declined 39% on a year-over-year basis and fell 14% sequentially. Management projected revenues of $1.7 billion (+/- $150 million) for the quarter under review.Seagate noted that bumpy economic recovery in China, cautious enterprise spending and continued inventory digestion by clients affected the top-line performance. The company expects these trends to persist through the first half of fiscal 2024. Seagate remains on track to ramp up volume of HAMR 30+ TB drives in early calendar-year 2024.Exabyte Shipments in DetailIn the reported quarter, Seagate shipped 91.2 exabytes of HDD storage. This marked a decline of 41% on a year-over-year basis and 23% sequentially. Average mass capacity decreased 18% year over year and 22% sequentially to 6.4 TB.The company shipped 75.2 exabytes for the mass-capacity storage market (including nearline, video and image applications and network-attached storage). This recorded a year-over-year and sequential plunge of 46% and 28%, respectively, in exabytes shipments. Average mass capacity per drive fell sequentially to 9.6 TB from 13 TB.In the nearline market, it shipped 54.7 exabytes of HDD, down 54% year over year and 37% sequentially.Seagate shipped 16 exabytes for the legacy market (which includes mission-critical notebooks, desktops, gaming consoles, digital video recorders or DVR and external consumer devices), down 1% year over year in exabyte shipments but up 9% sequentially. Average capacity improved sequentially by 10% to 2.5 TB.Story continuesRevenues by Product GroupTotal revenues for HDD (86.5% of revenues) tumbled 43% year over year to $1.385 billion in the reported quarter. On a sequential basis, revenues were down 14%.Non-HDD segment’s revenues (13.5%) including enterprise data solutions, cloud systems and solid-state drives were $218 million, unchanged on a year-over-year basis. However, this figure decreased 15% sequentially owing to lower enterprise systems volume.Margin DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin fell to 19.5% compared with the prior-year quarter’s 29.3%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 26% on a year-over-year basis to $258 million mostly due to cost cutting efforts and lower variable compensation.Non-GAAP income from operations totaled $55 million, down from $422 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin dipped to 3.4% compared with the year-ago quarter’s 16.1%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Jun 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $786 million compared with $766 million as of Apr 1, 2023.As of Jun 30, 2023, long-term debt (including the current portion) was $5.451 billion compared with $5.958 billion as of Apr 1, 2023.Cash flow from operations was $218 million compared with $228 million reported in the previous quarter. Free cash flow amounted to $168 million compared with $174 million in the previous quarter.The company paid $145 million as dividends in the fiscal fourth quarter. It exited the quarter with 207 million shares outstanding.OutlookManagement anticipates first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to be $1.55 billion (+/- $150 million). Non-GAAP loss for the fiscal first quarter is expected to be 16 cents per share (+/- 20 cents).How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -84.15% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Seagate has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Seagate has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlordRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsWorried about the economy? Here are the best shock-proof assets for your portfolio. (They’re all outside of the stock market.)“Our members just ratified the most lucrative agreement the Teamsters have ever negotiated at UPS. This contract will improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of workers,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien in a media statement.“Teamsters have set a new standard and raised the bar for pay, benefits and working conditions in the package delivery industry. This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention.”Here’s what the landmark contract looks like — and what one UPS driver has to say about the CEO’s claim.What’s in the contractUnder the new contract, existing full- and part-time UPS workers (in the Teamsters union) will get $2.75 more per hour in 2023 — and over the length of the contract, wage increases will total $7.50 per hour.Existing part-timers will get an immediate pay bump to at least $21 per hour and wage increases for full-timers will improve the average top rate of delivery drivers to $49 per hour over the course of the deal.Story continuesThe contract will also create 7,500 new full-time union jobs at UPS and the fulfillment of 22,500 open positions, giving more opportunities for part-timers to transition to full-time work.“This is the richest national contract I’ve seen in my more than 40 years of representing Teamsters at UPS,” said Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman. “There are more gains in this contract than in any other UPS agreement and with no givebacks to the company.“But the hard work doesn’t end here. We will continue to fight like hell to enforce this contract and make sure UPS lives up to every word of it over the next five years.”Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howUPS driver sets the record straightDuring a recent earnings call, UPS CEO Carol Tomé said the average full-time driver will earn around $170,000 annually in pay and benefits by the end of the five-year contract.When the new contract was first proposed, some people balked over the suggested $170,000 annual pay — especially on social media.TikTok user Skyler Lee Stutzman, who says he’s a driver for the parcel company, took to the video-sharing platform to set the record straight in a viral video that has been viewed nearly 20 million times.In the clip, which was posted before the contract was ratified, Stutzman claimed he was making $41.51, but under the new terms his pay would increase to $44.26 an hour — which aligns with the $2.75 increase in 2023 in announced by the Teamsters. He then multiplied that hourly rate by 2,080 hours (40 hours a week) to reach annual pay of about $92,000.Using the same formula, working 40 hours a week at $49/hour would pay just shy of $102,000 annually.“But that’s not including overtime,” Stutzman pointed out. “It’s also not the important part we’re missing here.“One of the other things that a lot of people don’t take into consideration is our medical insurance and our pension.”According to Stutzman’s breakdown, average pension contributions would account for an additional $24,960 a year. For its part, UPS says it contributes more than $23,000 a year to each full-time employee’s pension plan.As for medical insurance, Stutzman doesn’t give an estimate — but a survey commissioned by the Kaiser Family Foundation found the average annual premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance in 2022 were $7,911 for single coverage and $22,463 for family coverage.“You can quickly see that it would actually take about a $170,000 a year job to replace this one for me,” Stutzman acknowledges, saying the company is “amazing” to work for.In a later TikTok video that was also published before the contract was ratified, Stutzman made the claim that, although the Teamsters negotiated a “strong” contract, he believes if inflation continues at its current rate the new deal “still is not keeping up with inflation.”What to read nextThe US dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971 — invest in this stable asset before you lose your retirement fundHow can I stop the pain and make money in this nightmarish market?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Countries That Eat Chocolate the Most in the World.A Go-To Confectionery of All TimesOur very own affordable indulgence and beloved snack, chocolate, is a confectionery food which comes from cocoa beans and is consumed raw as well as a coating for various bakery products and sweet dishes. The origins of chocolate are traced 3,000 years back to the civilization of Maya where cocoa beans were used to make a ceremonial beverage. However, they were considered to be so sacred that people were buried with heaps of these beans. Chocolate was then introduced in the Spanish courts as a hot beverage seasoned with vanilla and cinnamon. It then took the shape of sweet eating chocolate and milk chocolate as it evolved. As we notice from this evolution, chocolate has been famous for many decades.On June 23, Reuters reported that cocoa hit the highest price in 46 consecutive years. This was due to the rainfall season in the African region which didn’t let the harvested cocoa dry and flooded the whole cocoa field.The Chocolate IndustryAccording to a report by Vantage Market Research, the global chocolate market was valued at $136.76 million in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.4% from 2023 to 2030.Around the world, Europe dominates the chocolate market. This high market share can be attributed to a number of factors such as the increase in chocolate imports, high chocolate production alongside the highest chocolate consumption per capita in some of the European countries such as Germany, the UK, and Russia.Asia Pacific is said to be the highest-growing market during the forecast period. This is due to the rise in disposable incomes, and more demand for nutritious chocolates with health consciousness.Story continuesNoteworthy NamesThe chocolate market is really saturated, with many incumbents. These incumbents strive to leverage their market shares by constantly adding to their product varieties. On August 10, ConfectioneryNews reported that the famous Swiss chocolate brand, Lindt, has recently launched its chocolate wafers in boxes, bars and bundles for the UK market.The producer of Smarties, KitKats and Quality Street chocolates, Nestle (OTC:NSRGY) is also looking forward to expanding its business in mature markets such as Mexico. On August 10, MSN reported that Nestle (OTC:NSRGY) is all set to invest $2.7 billion dollars in its Brazilian chocolate market. This amount is meant to improve the production lines for the KitKat manufacturing plant at Kavakava and the Vila Velha plant which produces Garoto chocolates for Nestle (OTC:NSRGY). Elaborating on the expansion of operations in Brazil, here’s what the Vice President of biscuits and chocolates for Nestle (OTC:NSRGY) Brazil said:""Nestlé's Brazilian operation has been growing consistently and sustainably over the years. In the last 12 months alone, we have seen an increase of 24%, based on the high demand in Brazil for the chocolate and biscuit portfolio.""Other big companies in the chocolate industry include Mars, Inc., Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY). Let’s take a look at all of them.Based in the United States, Mars, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of confectionery items, pet food and beverages. Mars Wrigley Confectionery is the candy making subsidiary of Mars, Inc. that produces all the skittles, M&amp;Ms, Mars bars and Milky Ways that we consume everyday.Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is an American producer of chocolates, chewing gum and other confectioneries. Ranked as one of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023, the company wins the hearts of chocolate lovers through its Cadbury Dairy Milk, Cote D’ Or, Milka, and Toblerone. Toblerone was the all-time favorite Swiss chocolate which Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) acquired. The company recorded $8.50 billion in revenue, a 17% year on year increase, in the second quarter of 2023.The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) is one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world. The company is also a member of the World Cocoa Foundation. On March 7, CNN reported that the company has launched its two new vegan products, ‘Hershey’s plant based extra creamy with almonds and sea salt’ and ‘Reese’s plant-based butter cups’. Net sales of $2.49 billion were recorded in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 5% from the previous year.On August 8, Reuters reported that due to the recent surge in cocoa prices, companies like The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) and Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) are experiencing less sales as consumers tend to give up on their expenditure on chocolate rather than paying high prices to satisfy their cravings.Modern Day Trends and ChallengesSince ages, chocolates have served to be a kind gesture offered at special occasions. We tend to see chocolates everywhere around us during festivities such as Christmas or Easter. Apart from chocolate being given as a gift, they are also consumed as a product of indulgence as mentioned above. As we see the public getting more aware of healthy ways of eating, chocolate products which are more organic and hygienic are getting more popular. Mordor Intelligence reports that the Functional Chocolate Company launched its dark chocolate by incorporating proportions of various minerals which could help consumers with their attention and focus. Radical innovation can also be seen in this industry as introduced by California Cultured, an innovative US based firm which produces chocolate in a sustainable way by avoiding deforestation. This is done by extracting the best cocoa seeds which are fed to replicate themselves.However, the trend of a healthy lifestyle has promoted an increasing health consciousness especially among those suffering from diabetes. Chocolates are still seen as hazardous products which boost blood sugar, leading to diseases in the longer run. Apart from this, sustainable production of chocolate products has been a concern for consumers. On June 21, Forbes reported that 5 to 6 million farmers around the world are involved in a strenuous cocoa production process. These farmers are deprived of the awareness and training they need for sustainable cocoa production. Although these farmers engage in hand labor for long hours, their efforts go unnoticed as they receive less than $1 per day which is a negligible amount. Furthermore, cocoa production and processing also involves child labor which is again an ethical issue. Cocoa is also vulnerable to diseases as evident from its past. Africa being the major cocoa production area is still subject to diseases like cacao swollen shoot virus which deeply infects the beans, ruining the overall yield.Now that we have looked over the chocolate industry and what companies like Mars, Inc., Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Nestle (OTC:NSRGY), and The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) are up to, let's take a look at the most chocolate eating countries in the world.20 Countries That Eat Chocolate The MostMethodologyIn order to generate a comprehensive list of countries that eat chocolate the most, we have used domestic supply of cocoa as a metric. We have found the domestic supply of cocoa for every country from the official database of  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The rationale behind choosing this metric was that domestic supply as quoted by the UN represents “the total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country, added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period”. Therefore, domestic supply represents exactly the amount of chocolate locally produced and imported or in other words, the amount of chocolate available for consumption in a country. We further screened these countries to find the top 20 countries that eat chocolate the most. Finally, we have ranked the countries in an ascending order of their domestic supplies, as of 2020, as follows:20. NigeriaDomestic Supply Quantity: 55 Thousand TonesAmong the top producers of cocoa lies Nigeria which is located in Africa. Although it supplies large volumes of cocoa to the world, the resulting wealth is not really retained in the area. The domestic chocolate market is being promoted by local manufacturers such as Loshes chocolates, Kalabari Gecko chocolates and Loom chocolate. As of 2020, the chocolate available for consumption in Nigeria was 55,000 tonnes.19. CameroonDomestic Supply Quantity: 56 Thousand TonnesHaving 90% of its cocoa produce exported to Europe, Cameroon also faces injustice like Nigeria. Most of the cocoa is exported, leaving the market with nothing. Barely any money comes back to the country. As of 2020, the domestic supply quantity of cocoa in Cameroon was 56,000 tonnes.For investors looking to increase their exposure to the chocolate market, some notable stocks to look up include Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Nestle (OTC:NSRGY), and The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY).18. JapanDomestic Supply Quantity: 64 Thousand TonnesMajor Japanese chocolate manufacturers include Lotte, Moringa &amp; Co. and Meiji Seika Kaisha. The Japanese people prefer more soft and less sweet products than sugary products. Chocolates also sell in high volumes on Valentines Day in Japan when the nation follows a tradition of girls buying chocolates for their partners and male peers. As of 2020, the domestic supply quantity of cocoa in Japan was 64,000 tonnes.17.PeruDomestic Supply Quantity: 84 Thousand TonnesA home to Theobroma cacao which is a small cocoa bearing tree, Peru, is one of the 20 countries that eat chocolate the most in the world. The Amazon basin in Peru is known for its cocoa production. As of 2020, the domestic supply quantity of cocoa in Peru was 84,000 tonnes.16. SpainDomestic Supply Quantity: 104 Thousand TonnesCocoa, the core component of chocolate, first arrived in Spain from Mexico and was deemed to be bitter by the Spanish. Eventually, they added vanilla, sugar and honey to make it sweet and that is how it ended up becoming a famous confectionery in the form of chocolate.  Spain ranks as one of the largest cocoa importers in Europe. As of 2020, the domestic supply quantity of cocoa in Spain was 104,000 tonnes.15. Russian FederationDomestic Supply Quantity: 106 Thousand TonnesPopular Russian chocolate makers include Babaevsky, Krasny Oktyabr, and Rot Front.

As of 2020, the domestic supply quantity of cocoa in Russia was 106,000 tonnes.14. United KingdomDomestic Supply Quantity: 117 Thousand TonnesThe country has witnessed a reduction in cocoa imports as well as exports after 2021 due to Brexit. More than half of the cocoa imported comes directly from Ghana and Ivory Coast. Milk chocolate is mostly preferred with a niche inclining towards dark chocolate to seek its health benefits. Famous chocolate brands known in the United Kingdom include Cadbury, Galaxy, and Maltesers. As of 2020, the domestic supply quantity of cocoa in the United Kingdom was 117,000 tonnes.13.

GhanaDomestic Supply Quantity: 144 Thousand TonnesThe land of cocoa production, Ghana, fulfills the chocolate requirement of many chocolate enthusiasts.

As of 2020, the domestic supply quantity of cocoa in Ghana was 144,000 tonnes.9. TürkiyeDomestic Supply Quantity: 161 Thousand TonnesChocolate is mostly taken as a token of pleasure instead of a product of nutritional value in Turkey.

FranceDomestic Supply Quantity: 238 Thousand TonnesKnown as the fourth largest cocoa importer of Europe, France enjoys its place in the top 20 countries that eat chocolate the most.

Côte d'IvoireDomestic Supply Quantity: 305 Thousand TonnesThe biggest producer of cocoa beans in the world, Côte d'Ivoire, also known as the Ivory Coast, is a state in West Africa. In order to reap the benefits of something the local farmers have harvested with their own hands, some of them have started to convert cocoa beans into local industry products like cocoa tea, chocolate spread and paste. As of 2020, the domestic supply quantity of cocoa in Côte d'Ivoire was 305,000 tonnes.Some of the top companies in the chocolate industry include Mondelez International Inc.

That process consumes around 8 billion tons of sand (out of the 40-50 billion tons used annually) which has, in part, led to acute shortages of the building commodity in recent years. At the same time, we generate about 10 billion kilograms of used coffee grounds over the same span — coffee grounds which a team of researchers from RMIT University in Australia have discovered can be used as a silica substitute in the concrete production process that, in the proper proportions, yields a significantly stronger chemical bond than sand alone.“The disposal of organic waste poses an environmental challenge as it emits large amounts of greenhouse gases including methane and carbon dioxide, which contribute to climate change,” lead author of the study, Dr Rajeev Roychand of RMIT's School of Engineering, said in a recent release. He notes that Australia alone produces 75 million kilograms of used coffee grounds each year, most of which ends up in landfills.Coffee grounds can't simply be mixed in raw with standard concrete as they won't bind with the other materials due to their organic content, Dr. Roychand explained. In order to make the grounds more compatible, the team experimented with pyrolyzing the materials at 350 and 500 degrees C, then substituting them in for sand in 5, 10, 15 and 20 percentages (by volume) for standard concrete mixtures.The team found that at 350 degrees is perfect temperature, producing a ""29.3 percent enhancement in the compressive strength of the composite concrete blended with coffee biochar,"" per the team's study, published in the September issue of Journal of Cleaner Production. ""In addition to reducing emissions and making a stronger concrete, we're reducing the impact of continuous mining of natural resources like sand,"" Dr. Roychand said.""The concrete industry has the potential to contribute significantly to increasing the recycling of organic waste such as used coffee,"" added study co-author Dr Shannon Kilmartin-Lynch, a Vice-Chancellor’s Indigenous Postdoctoral Research Fellow at RMIT. ""Our research is in the early stages, but these exciting findings offer an innovative way to greatly reduce the amount of organic waste that goes to landfill,” where its decomposition would generate large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide.]"

The increase in revenue was driven by increased comparable-store sales, which surged 8%, strong new store performance, and growth in other revenue, the company said.“The Ulta Beauty team delivered another quarter of strong performance, with sales, gross profit, and SG&amp;A expenses all better than our internal expectations,” stated CEO Dave Kimbell about Ulta’s earnings report. “The beauty category has continued to deliver healthy growth, as consumers maintain their post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty.”Even though Ulta beat on earnings, its margins were under pressure in the quarter, including a 110 basis point contraction in its gross margin to 39.3%, which is said was “primarily due to lower merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs.”The beauty retailer’s stock reacted to the news by falling slightly at the open of the day’s trading session. It was down about 3% by Friday early afternoon.Shrink, the retail industry’s terminology for theft, has been a major theme this earnings season, especially in the reports of Dick’s Sporting Goods, Target, Dollar Tree, and Foot Locker, as Kiplinger recently reported.“Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind this quarter. Our efforts to address shrink are having an impact, but the overall environment remains challenging,” Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten stated on the conference call.Fortunately, Ulta has been able to navigate the many issues facing the industry and still deliver better-than-expected earnings. As a result, Ulta raised its full-year outlook for 2023. It now expects revenue in the range of $11.05 billion to $11.15 billion, comparable-store sales growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, an operating margin in the range of 14.6% to 14.8%, and diluted EPS of $25.10 to $25.60.Story continues“Our updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance while continuing to consider risks and uncertainties that could impact demand in the second half of the year, including rising consumer debt levels and the expected resumption of student loan repayments,” Settersten stated.“As we look to the future, we are focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the beauty category and executing our strategic framework to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all our stakeholders,” Settersten concluded.Related ContentMacy’s Sales Slide As Retailer Issues ‘Cautious' 2023 OutlookToll Brothers Beats Q3 Estimates As New Home Sales RiseAdvance Auto Parts Updates Guidance As Profits Fall]"

Dave?Story continuesDave Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, gross profit and SG&amp;A expenses all better than planned. Net sales increased 10.1% to $2.5 billion and comparable sales increased 8%. Operating profit was 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share. In addition to delivering great financial results, our teams executed against our operational priorities. During the quarter, we drove growth across all major categories, increased the number of loyalty members, strengthened our brand engagement and achieved important milestones within our multiyear transformation initiatives. Through the first half, our financial results are ahead of our internal expectations and I remain confident we can deliver against our updated guidance for fiscal 2023.I want to express my sincere appreciation to all Ulta Beauty associates for their continued commitment to delivering great guest experiences while working collaboratively to execute our ambitious transformational agenda. Starting with the discussion of our operational results, we saw strong solid sales performance across both our store and digital channels, driven by double-digit traffic growth. All major categories delivered comp growth for the quarter, supported by strong engagement with the overall beauty category, compelling product newness and innovation and successful execution of cross-category promotional events, including our reimagined Big Summer Beauty Sale. Building on last year's promotional events, we consolidated key summer events like our popular Jumbo Love and Mix and Match Minis into a broader, more cohesive event with holistic storytelling and impactful messaging.The three-week long Big Summer Beauty Sale drove market disruption, member conversion and strong sales across our Hair Care, Makeup and Skin Care categories. Turning to performance by category. Skin Care continues to be one of our strongest categories even as we lap unprecedented growth during the pandemic. For the quarter, both Prestige and Mass skin care delivered double-digit growth. Newer brands, including Bubble, BYOMA and Beautycounter and innovation from existing brands like The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant and Supergoop! contributed to the strong sales results. Reflecting consumer interest in dermatologist recommended brands, La Roche-Posay and CeraVe continued to perform well and brands like Good Molecules, Hero Cosmetics and Peach Slices continue to benefit from social virality.The Fragrance and Bath category delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Layering and wardrobing scents as a form of self-expression especially among Gen Z consumers, continues to drive category engagement. Newness from Ariana Grande, Valentino and Burberry contributed to the category's performance and key gift-giving events like Mother's Day and Father's Day drove growth for luxury brands like Carolina Herrera, Chanel and YSL. The Hair Care category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth driven by newness and guest engagement with our strategic events. Hair Care focused on bonding, scalp treatments and other repair solutions as well as products that offer healthy heat styling options continue to drive consumer engagement. Trend-relevant products from professional brands of Redken, Biolage and Matrix as well as newness from prestige brands Way and IGK resonated strongly.New brands, including exclusive brands LolaVie created by Jennifer Anderson, and Donna's Recipe also contributed to growth this quarter. While still challenged as we lap several years of strong growth, sales trends in hair tools improved from the first quarter, driven by compelling newness from Dyson and innovation from Bio Ionic. Finally, makeup delivered low single-digit comp growth, driven by strong performance in mass cosmetics. New brands like Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Beautycounter drove growth during the quarter, while new and exclusive products from a wide range of brands, including e.l.f, NYX and OPI also contributed positively. Compelling events, including our Big Summer Beauty Sale, National Lipstick Week and our foundation event as well as successful Barbie and Little Mermaid collaborations drove guest engagement.While the performance of mass cosmetics benefited from engaging newness in social content, our prestige makeup business was challenged as we lapped the significant impact of the Fenty launch last year. Our Services business delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter, primarily driven by increased appointments. Guests are engaging in core cut, color and blowout services as well as newer services, including extensions and scalp and hair treatments. We continue to enhance our service offering, and this quarter, we launched ear piercings chain-wide and introduced a new Keratin Express treatment. The Beauty category growth remains healthy across both Prestige and Mass price tiers as consumers maintain their post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty.When we look at the total beauty market, our analysis demonstrates we continue to gain market share. In Mass Beauty, we gained share this quarter across all major categories. In Prestige, we continue to drive solid gains in skin and fragrance but saw pressure in makeup and hair based on Circana's beauty sales data. Our proprietary insights suggest consumers are becoming less focused on product pricing tiers and are trading around, choosing to engage with brands that offer on-trend newness and compelling social media content. As the only beauty retailer to offer a curated assortment of products from entry-level mass to luxury and everything in between, we are uniquely positioned to capture share of the total beauty market as consumers shift.We remain confident in the resilience of beauty. Our strategic framework guides our priorities and positions us to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth. Let me share some highlights of the progress we made against this framework in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Newness and Innovation are critical growth drivers for Beauty. Newness comes to life in the form of new brands, products and product lines, shade extensions and reformulations, and fuels discovery and drive trips and engagement. As we seek to continuously delight guests with All Things Beauty, we continue to expand our assortment and innovate -- with innovative and emerging brands.Building on newness introduced in the first half, we have several exciting launches planned for the third quarter, including Half Magic, a vegan and cruelty-free makeup brand created by Euphoria makeup artist Donni Davy exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Polite Society, a prestige makeup brand exclusive to Ulta Beauty created by the founders of Too Faced Cosmetics. Rabanne, a contemporary and relevant Spanish fashion brand launching cosmetics exclusively at Ulta Beauty. Hair styling tools at accessible price points from Shark Beauty. PanOxyl, a dermatologist recommended brand popular with Gen Z and Sniph, an emerging fragrance band offering gender neutral sense available only at Ulta Beauty. Reflecting the growth and popularity of luxury products with younger generations, last quarter, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty in 200 stores and on ulta.com.The program has exceeded our expectations and we continue to see strong guest engagement with our offerings across all categories. Building on this success, we are excited to launch Pat McGrath Labs, a BIPOC, LUXE Artistry makeup brand. Pat McGrath is a trusted expert who has shaped and disrupted the cosmetic category. Now let me share an update on our key cross-category platforms which lean into broader emerging trends in beauty, products that are good for the world, inclusivity and wellness. As we seek to provide guests with a diverse assortment that reflects their personal values and individual needs, we continue to expand our assortment of brands featuring clean, cruelty-free and vegan ingredients, leveraging sustainable packaging and driving positive impact through our Conscious Beauty platform.At the end of the quarter, 314 brands were certified in at least one pillar, with more than 270 brands certified in multiple pillars. To ensure all guests feel connected and reflected at Ulta Beauty, we continue our important efforts to drive inclusivity. In addition to amplifying our portfolio of BIPOC brands through informative marketing and in-store presentations, this quarter, we hosted a summit for our BIPOC brands, providing them with opportunities to network with peers while learning more about the beauty industry and operational best practices. Lastly, as the importance of beauty as a form of self-care and wellness continues to build, we enhanced the wellness shop assortment with the launch of two exciting supplements. Lemme Gummies created by Kourtney Kardashian and the introduction of Big Brain Probiotics from Love Wellness.Turning now to our second strategic pillar, All in Your World. We are enhancing guest experiences across all of our touch points. Guests continue to shift effortlessly between physical and digital channels, depending on their individual needs, and we are committed to meeting them wherever they are in their beauty journey. Reflecting our efforts to enhance our Buy Anywhere, Bill Anywhere capabilities, we have expanded our same-day delivery option to essentially every store and improved our store fulfilment process to drive greater efficiency and speed. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our e-commerce sales and 39% of our digital orders were fulfilled by our store teams this quarter. Our consumer insights and member data confirm the importance of physical shopping in beauty.More than 75% of our members choose to transact with us only in stores, and yet we know many of these members use our digital platforms for discovery, try-on and inspiration. Converting these members to omni-channel members is a meaningful opportunity to increase engagement and spend per member as omni-channel shoppers spend 2.5 times to 3 times more than single channel shoppers. Importantly, the increase in spend is largely incremental. Expanded engagement with our mobile app is one way we are driving omni-channel conversion. Through our digital store refresh, we enhanced the user search and discovery experience, seamlessly blending commerce and content for a more personalized experience. We also continue to expand and enhance our digital try-on capabilities.This quarter, we launched a virtual try-on tool that enables guests to try multiple nail looks simultaneously, and we upgraded our virtual hair try-on experience with expanded color options and enhanced transfer quality and speed. These enhancements, combined with awareness campaigns, unique offers to drive utilization and increased associate education have delivered meaningful growth. Over the last 12 months, 9 million active members have engaged with our mobile app, double the number of members who engaged with the app before the pandemic. And we're seeing stronger engagement, with more than 55% of e-commerce sales coming through our mobile app. Turning to our partnership with Target. We opened 62 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 421 shops.Our marketing teams work closely with our target partners to build awareness for newer brands, including Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande Fragrances, Glamnetic and Living Proof, while also amplifying Summer Prestige must-haves and minis. As the partnership scales, we are learning more about the Ulta Beauty at Target guests and the role this touchpoint plays in their beauty journey and we will continue to leverage our expertise to develop unique assortments that reflect the preferences of the Ulta Beauty at Target guests. Moving to our third strategic pillar, operating at the Heart of the Beauty community, we are focused on driving greater love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. We began this quarter with a Mother's Day campaign that highlighted exclusive cross-category gifts, including our luxury assortment and hero fragrances.Moving into June, we positioned Ulta Beauty as the destination for Summer Beauty, driving top-of-mind awareness and traffic with compelling points offers and special deals across the assortment to celebrate our members. Finally, we closed the quarter with our Big Summer Beauty Sale, a bold and disruptive event that offered opportunities to save on fan favourite beauty items across all categories and price points from a variety of established and emerging brands. These key events, paired with our culturally-relevant content amplifications, drove record-level highs in unaided awareness, with our greatest gains among Gen Z consumers. Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 41.7 million active members, 9% higher than last year, driven by strong member acquisition and reactivation combined with healthy retention of existing members.Spend per member also increased, driven by greater shopper frequency. The strength of our loyalty program continues to be a powerful and differentiated strategic asset for Ulta Beauty and we are pleased with its elevated growth and performance. Our continued efforts to nurture the member life cycle is driving results. We accelerated new member acquisition and continue to engage and retain members with meaningful events, compelling points offers, personalized content and special guests. These strategies also delivered growth in our Diamond and Platinum tiers, which increased nearly 30% compared to the same period last year, reflecting strong loyalty and engagement with all Ulta Beauty offers. Turning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization.We are executing an ambitious multiyear road map of transformation initiatives intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our future growth. As we have discussed on previous calls, we are expanding and optimizing our supply chain, upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform, transitioning our digital store to a new platform, enhancing our data management systems and upgrading store POS systems. I am pleased to share that our teams have delivered several key milestones. Our new Greer, South Carolina market fulfillment center began receiving inventory last month, and we expect to start shipping to stores next week. We completed the installation of a new automated storage and retrieval system in our Greenwood distribution center, which will increase capacity and enable greater productivity.We expanded our ship-from-store capabilities to an additional 276 stores. Today, we fulfill e-commerce orders from 400 strategically-located stores, enabling faster, more cost-effective delivery to the guest. We successfully transitioned two distribution centers, Jacksonville and Greer, to our new ERP platform. As part of our digital store transformation, we successfully completed a large-scale upgrade of our end-to-end e-commerce platform and migrated to a new, modernized platform that includes a new promotion engine, guest account, cart and checkout. This is a significant milestone in our multiyear effort to elevate our digital experience in a way that positions us for long-term growth in this critical channel. Finally, we completed the POS upgrade in all stores.While our transformation agenda is not finished, we have made significant progress, and I am proud of how our teams have worked to execute our plans while limiting disruption to guests and associates. Looking forward, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment. While consumer confidence has strengthened, there are signs pointing to moderating growth going forward. Many consumers have begun to reduce overall spending, credit card debt remains high and the restart of student loan repayments is approaching. It is unclear how these factors will impact consumer behavior in the near term, but despite these factors, Beauty has remained a bright spot. Based on Circana's beauty sales data, total US beauty sales for the first half of 2023 increased double-digits compared to the same period last year with Prestige beauty channels delivering higher growth than Mass beauty channels.Looking to the rest of the year, we believe growth for the US beauty market will remain healthy but normalize into the mid-single digits as we lap two years of strong growth, experience less impact from pricing and face more economic uncertainty. As category growth normalizes, we continue to expect promotional activity within the category will also normalize. Over the last two years, unprecedented category growth and strong demand limited promotional activity. As a result, the promotional environment in 2021 and 2022 was unsustainably low. Reflecting these factors, we planned for higher promotional activity this year but continue to expect promotions will remain well below 2019 levels. In closing, we operate in an attractive and growing category.We have a strong, proven business model and a winning culture and outstanding teams. Through the first half of fiscal 2023, we have exceeded our internal financial expectations and we remain confident we can deliver our updated expectations for the rest of the year. And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave shared, we delivered second quarter financial results that were ahead of our expectations. Strong sales growth supported by healthy guest engagement and strong in-store sales performance drove better-than-expected gross margin. SG&amp;A spend was also lower than planned, resulting in an operating margin of 15.5%. Turning to the P&amp;L. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.1%, driven by 8% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenues. Transactions for the quarter increased 9%, primarily driven by healthy traffic across both channels. Average ticket decreased 1% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of higher average selling price.The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by the impact of retail price increases, many of which were executed last year. We estimate price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp. During the quarter, we opened three new stores and relocated two stores. In addition, we re-modeled three stores. Second quarter gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 39.3% compared to 40.4% last year. The decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin, an increase in inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs. Overall merchandise margin was lower due primarily to increased promotional activity, unfavorable category mix and less benefit from the timing of retail price changes. While promotional activity continues to normalize, it is important to note that overall promotions remain well below 2019 levels.Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind this quarter. Our efforts to address shrink are having an impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. Today, we have the new fragrance fixtures in more than 50% of our stores and expect to have these installed in 70% of the fleet by year-end. We remain focused on taking action in areas we can control, including continued investment in fixtures, associate training, staffing as well as operational improvements and leveraging our influence to enact broader changes that will disincentivize unlawful behavior. Supply chain costs were higher, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our supply chain transformation, as we made progress on the retrofit of our Dallas and Greenwood distribution centers and prepared to open our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina.These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs due to top line sales growth. SG&amp;A increased 12.4% to $600.7 million. SG&amp;A increased 40 basis points to 23.7% compared to 23.3% last year. The increase in SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales was driven by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments, planned increases in store payroll and benefits and higher store expenses, which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, other IT capabilities and UB Media. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested a little less than half of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives.The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned growth in average wage rates and increased staffing levels compared to the same period last year. Incentive compensation was a tailwind in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. Operating income for the quarter was $391.6 million, flat to last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 15.5% compared to 17% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share compared to $5.70 per share last year. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 9% to $1.82 billion compared to $1.67 billion last year.In addition to the impact of 37 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand, increases in product costs and new brand launches. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter compared to $49.4 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in IT and supply chain to support our transformational agenda as well as merchandising investments to support the rollout of our luxury assortment and brand expansions. Depreciation was $61.9 million in the quarter compared to $60.9 million last year. We ended the quarter with $388.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 594,000 shares at a cost of $275.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $559 million.At the end of the second quarter, we had $541 million remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. Moving to our outlook. We are updating our guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our better-than-expected second quarter performance. We have raised our top line expectations and now project net sales will be between $11.05 billion and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. Our updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance while continuing to consider risks and uncertainties that could impact demand in the second half of the year, including rising consumer debt levels and the expected resumption of student loan repayments. We continue to expect comps will moderate to the low single-digits in the second half of the year, and we remain on track to open 25 to 30 new stores and renovate or relocate 20 to 30 stores this year.Reflecting our year-to-date performance, we've raised the low end of the range of operating margin and now expect operating margins for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come fairly evenly from both gross margin and SG&amp;A. Our expectations reflect the continuation of the trends we experienced through the first half of the year around shrink, promotional activity and supply chain costs, as well as greater headwind from lapping the merchandise margin benefits from the timing of retail price increases last year. For modeling purposes, we expect third quarter operating margin will be meaningfully more pressured than what we saw in the second quarter as we lap greater pricing benefits in the third quarter last year, as well as a shift of investment spending from Q2 to Q3.As a result, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter will be lower than last year. Reflecting these updated assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $25.10 and $25.60. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share. In closing, our results through the first six months of fiscal 2023 highlights the ongoing power and resilience of our business model. I'd like to thank our associates for their dedication and commitment to keeping our guests at the center of all we do and giving them more reasons to shop Ulta Beauty. As we look to the future, we are focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the beauty category and executing our strategic framework to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all our stakeholders.And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&amp;A session.See also Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks and 11 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks to Buy.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Ashley Helgans: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. To start, maybe any details you can share on how traffic progressed throughout the quarter and what you're seeing now in August? And then also on the fragrances being locked up, have you seen any adverse effects on sales? Thanks.Dave Kimbell: Yes. Ashley, for the quarter, we saw strong traffic throughout the quarter with double-digit traffic. And we continue to be pleased with the engagement that we're seeing, and we saw actual comp performance sequentially accelerate through the quarter as well. And all of those trends are reflected into our updated and elevated guidance for the full year. On Fragrance, the -- I'll let Kecia kind of discuss what we're doing in Fragrance and how that's impacting our business.Kecia Steelman: Yes. Actually, we've locked up about 50% of our stores right now. And what we're seeing is in the initial stores that we rolled out the locked fragrance cases for, we actually saw sales improvement because we were in stock with the product and we had it available to the guests. So we're staying very close to that. We're also investing in labor because we don't want to be sales preventative from the guests being able to purchase. So that's a little bit of the investment in labor that you heard earlier from Scott, is that in these stores, we are upping our labor a bit because we want to make sure that we're able to take care of the guests. So we're staying close to it. The bottom line is that we're pleased that we're able to maintain our in-stock for our guests, and quite frankly, keep the bad actors from coming into our stores.Ashley Helgans: Okay. Thanks.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.Michael Baker: Thanks. I'm just curious, you said you expect the beauty industry to grow mid-single digits, yet you're only expecting comps to be up low single digits. And even if you add in store growth, you're still expecting to grow maybe up, but seemingly below the industry. I don't suppose you guys think you're losing share, so I'm just wondering if you can help flesh that out a little bit?Dave Kimbell: Yes, I'd say, yes, we do anticipate continuing to gain share. We've done so through the first half of the year, and that is our outlook. The commentary is really as we look into the second half of the year, we see some strength. Engagement continues to be high. Certainly, our business is performing very well. We're attracting new members. We're growing across all key categories, both and then in both e-com and stores. But we also see some uncertainty as we get in later into the year. So while we're confident in the category, we're just incorporating into our outlook some full -- some of that. And for the full year, we're looking at revenue in the plus 8% to 9% range, so we anticipate gaining share for the year being ahead of the total category growth. That will be our plan.Michael Baker: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.Olivia Tong: Thank you. My first question is around Prestige versus Mass breakout, because you mentioned in Skin that you're still seeing strong growth in both Prestige and Mass. But only in Mass from makeup, but you mentioned that the launch of Fenty a year ago was a big contributor. So if you exclude that, are you seeing anything different there? And then going forward, as you think about your expectations on growth in Mass versus Prestige, what implications may that have on comp, in your view? Thank you.Dave Kimbell: What was the last part of that question? What was -- could you repeat the last?Olivia Tong: Yes. Just the implication on comp, if what you're thinking in terms of growth of Mass versus Prestige across your stores? And what implications that might have in terms of comp if Mass becomes a bigger piece of the driver of growth?Dave Kimbell: Well, yes, we -- as I discussed, we've seen strong performance really across our entire assortment as we look at it, but Mass has been a bit stronger for a couple of quarters now in -- across our business. And that's driven largely by strong consumer engagement across some key brands in Makeup, Health, Mix and some others are really hitting the market with great innovation, great marketing, great consumer engagement. And the fact that we offer the full assortment from Mass to Prestige is a real benefit. We're able to capitalize on strong trends and strong engagements across all aspects of that. In Skin Care, we're seeing brands, particularly in the dermatologist recommended area driving strong growth, and that's great.We -- strong player for us. As we look forward, it's always our intent to continue to adapt and adjust and lean into the areas that are driving growth, find ways to strengthen those that may be more challenged, but we're confident in the outlook going forward. And the fact that we have both is unique. Of course you know that, but the fact that we're the only ones that offer Mass, Masstige, Prestige and a growing established now business in luxury. We're seeing strong points across all. We'll continue to flex and adapt and incorporate it into our comp guidance is our ability to continue to drive growth. But through the first half of the year, we're really pleased with the Mass performance and several brands driving strong growth, and continue to lean in and bring innovation into the Prestige side of the business.And collectively, it's working to allow us to gain share across Ulta Beauty.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate, is your line on mute.Dave Kimbell: We go to the next person.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Anthony Chukumba: Good afternoon. Congrats on the solid results and thanks for taking my question. So just a real quick one. You mentioned Luxury, and in fact, it's exceeding your expectations. You mentioned launching Pat McGrath Labs. It's all one related question in just two parts. First off, what -- is Luxury -- what percentage of your assortment, I guess, is Luxury in the stores that it's in? And is it big enough at this point to be a comp driver?Dave Kimbell: Yes. Won't break out exact percentages. Again, to reiterate, it's in 200 stores. We're really pleased with it, a strong assortment across a number of the very best brands in Luxury. Chanel, Dior, NATASHA DENONA, HOURGLASS, an extension of Chanel with Chanel Numero Un, Lancome, Absolute , now Pat McGrath. A Luxury fragrance business with brands like YSL and Tom Ford and Viktor&amp;Rolf. So we won't get into exact percentages, but it is an important part of our overall strategy. We know there's growth in the Luxury side of the business. We've been in Luxury for a while, but now with this expanded residence, it is a contributor to our total comp. We're excited about the addition of Pat McGrath and we'll continue to innovate and evolve and find ways to drive further growth down the road. So, yes, we think it's -- we know it's contributing to our growth and we're excited about our guest response to an expanded luxury experience.Anthony Chukumba: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Christopher Horvers: Thanks. Good evening. A layered gross margin question. So how did shrink in the promotional environment play out in the second quarter relative to your expectations? Have you changed any of your expectations around those line items in the back half? And do you expect any improvement perhaps in the shrink line? And then Scott, could you remind us of the price cost headwind that we faced in the third quarter? Because I know that was pretty significant last year. Thank you.Scott Settersten: Sure, Chris. So, yes, versus -- we did say, again, versus our expectations for the quarter, we're very happy with the overall financial results we were able to deliver. So breaking it down a little bit more, I'd say merchandise margin was better than what we expected and so that speaks partially to the promotional lever that people are focused on here. So again, generally better than what we expected, so we can lean in and lean out. That's one of the great strengths of our business, being able to have real-time information and be able to take quick action and be agile. I'd say shrink generally directionally about the same as what we saw in the first quarter. As we look out to the rest of the year, we don't really -- we're not anticipating a significant turn in expectations there.We expect it to be tough the rest of the way. And we'll say maybe the fourth quarter may be slightly less negative than it was early part of the year because remember, last year in the fourth quarter was the first time we really called out and quantified what the shrink impact was, so we did have a little bit of a catch-up there. Over -- and then fixed -- store fixed costs we talked about, that was stronger than what we -- going in expectation because sales were a bit stronger than what we thought. And then channel mix overall helped us as well. As we look to think about gross margin the second half of the year, I'd say the drivers, the headwinds are consistent with what we've seen in the first half of 2023. Again, we're taking a prudent approach as we always do with our guidance, and we'll work hard to do better than that.Christopher Horvers: And then the price cost in 3Q?Scott Settersten: Yes. So there was -- we -- third quarter last year is where we saw a significant step-up in the pricing increases across the portfolio, and really, the margin benefit started really rolling through in the second quarter and into the back half of the year. So this is really the toughest anniversary point in the year is ahead of us right now, and that's why we're calling out third quarter. Third quarter is kind of peak on a number of different fronts. Again, every year is a little unique, but the third quarter now, we've got a little bit of delays in some of our project work, which is shifting back some of our IT expense into the third quarter. And a lot of that flows through SG&amp;A, so we'll see more pressure there than we saw earlier in the year, and then likewise, with gross margin.And a little -- more moderate sales growth expectations, coupled with cycling over the margin benefits last year from the price increases step up in the back half of the year, putting more pressure on third quarter than maybe some would expect. But again, by the time we get in the fourth quarter and get back to focusing on sales in the holiday, we expect that to bounce back in a healthy manner.Christopher Horvers: Got it. Thank you.Operator: Our next question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Adrienne Yih: Great. Thank you very much. Scott, I'm going to stay on that topic with the third quarter. If I'm not mistaken, it seems like about $10 million to $12 million of the SG&amp;A spend perhaps is moving into the third quarter. And if we have a little bit more gross margin pressure, does that imply that EPS could be down sort of high single-digit range? Just wondering if I'm in the right ballpark.Scott Settersten: Yes. We don't want to -- into quantifying it specifically, Adrienne. But I'd say directionally, you're in the right zip code. So yes, on the SG&amp;A side, that's roughly the shift back into the third quarter on some of the IT spend. And yes, operating margin is going to be down meaningfully versus what we saw earlier this year, and that's going to result in negative EPS growth year-over-year for the third quarter.Adrienne Yih: Super helpful. And then to just follow through with the SG&amp;A. So can you help us walk through the phases? I know there's four phases of Project SOAR and all of the other investments. It seems like you're running sort of dual structures perhaps on some of the DCs and then the website or, let's call it, 1/3 or half of the year. How should we think about that rolling off? Because a lot of this kind of redundancy will go away next year. I know you're not giving guidance, but just to help us shape sort of what SG&amp;A growth looks like last next year? Because it seems like it comes down a lot on the consensus. I just want to make sure we have that correct in our mind. Thank you.Kecia Steelman: Adrienne, I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to Scott. So yes, we're in the middle of an ambitious transformational agenda. That's for sure. And part of this is really positioning all parts of the organization for our future efforts, and now we're really pleased with how our progress is working. But anyone who's taken on this large scale of a project, we definitely have timing shifts that happen because we want to make sure that while we're staying forward, progressing and moving, we are really limited in our distraction and our disruption for our guests and also for our associates. So we've adopted a few of our time lines and have shifted a couple of the projects from Q2 into Q3, and we might even see some shifting from Q3 into Q4, but we're still on track to spend the $60 million to $70 million incremental to the prior year.And while we've got some of those shifts, we still are very confident that we're going to stay with our overall time line and how things wrapped up by the right time line for next year, which is more mid-2024. I'll turn it over to Scott.Scott Settersten: Yes, and you're exactly right. We're not providing guidance for 2024 here today, but yes, investors should expect that we will cultivate, recoup benefits from the significant investments that we're making in our core systems year 2022 into '23 and that we're going to see benefits materialized in 2024 and beyond. Again, you've heard us talk about, these are major initiatives here that we expect to see dividends for a number of years into the future, but I would also caution investors just to be prepared. I mean there's -- we are in the business of growing Ulta Beauty for the long term, and so there's plenty of other great growth initiatives out there that we've got in the queue that we're ready to go tackle. As soon as we get through some of more of this, I'd call core transformation work here in '23 and early 2024.Adrienne Yih: Thank you. That's very helpful. Best of luck.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kelly Crago with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Kelly Crago: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a couple of quick ones on categories. Just on Makeup, it looks like Makeup's growth decelerated from high-singles in 1Q to mid-singles in 2Q. Was that driven by a slowdown -- a subsequent slowdown in Prestige? Did both decelerate? And how should we think about Makeup growing in 2H? And then just secondly on Skin, we've heard from some of the brands that maybe there's slowing growth in that category, but you do under index versus the category overall. So just curious whether that dynamic can help offset maybe some weaknesses that we're seeing or starting to see in Skin? And any thoughts on the growth there would be great. Thank you.Dave Kimbell: Yes. I'd say on Makeup, the main driver is while our -- we're bringing a lot of innovation and newness across that Prestige portfolio, lapping -- really, one of the biggest launches in the history of Ulta Beauty with Fenty, lapping that fully in the second quarter is probably the biggest driver. We're excited though as we look forward. I mentioned a few launches that we that we have coming out Rabanne, Pat McGrath, Polite Society, among others that many of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty and are coming into our business in the second half of the year. But we anticipate as we lap that launch, we'll continue to see pressure on Prestige. Mass continues to drive growth behind great innovation, great engagement. And so we're pleased with the total Makeup side of the business even as we address some of the pressure in lapping previous launches.In the Skin Care side, yes, we are -- we have somewhat lower share than we do in makeup, but our -- we have established over time a meaningful share position and the fact that we're able to continue to drive growth is, again, a testament to our model, our ability, the strength we have across price points. We're seeing strong healthy growth in both Mass and Prestige, really leaning into dermatologist recommended space and believe that we can continue to drive growth going forward and continue to drive share. The category, we think, is healthy. As I said, with the total beauty category, we do anticipate some moderation. It's unlikely to see double-digit growth forever, but we're leaning in. We've got a great skin business. Our merchants continue to bring strong innovation.Our store teams are doing a great job educating our guests, and we're delivering a lot of growth and we see more coming.Kelly Crago: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Kate McShane: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for giving me another chance here to ask our question. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the strategy behind combining your promotional events like you did this past quarter? And did you see a bigger lift as a result of that change versus last year? Will there be any similar approaches to some of your promotional events being taken in the second half?Dave Kimbell: Great. Yes, I almost used your silence to answer any question that I wanted to. Maybe in the earlier case, but glad you got back in the queue. Yes, we're excited. We -- I think what we did in the second quarter, what our teams did, our merchant marketing, digital, store teams, our go-to-market teams, really, we -- they are continually evaluating how we can get better and how we can elevate the impact, and the summer sale is an example of that. We had strong events, solid events that were delivering for years, but the team, through great consumer insights, continued understanding of guest behavior and full understanding of what unique strengths we bring to the table, re-evaluated that. And we're pleased with the results of that event, the Big Summer Sale as well as, really, our entire promotional strategy.It was not a huge acceleration in promotional intensity as much as a smarter strategy and it worked. Our guests engaged, we attracted new members, it delivered strong comp growth, we saw strength in both stores and on our e-commerce business, traffic was healthy. So it's -- frankly, didn't surprise me because I know how the team continues to look for ways to elevate, and it's another example of great strategy leading to a strong execution. As we look into the second half of the year, we're evaluating, as we always do, every aspect of our go-to-market strategy. We continue to evolve our efforts. We'll adapt to competitive changes, consumer insights and make sure we're delivering at a high level. Sunday, Kate, starts 21 Days of Beauty, one of our biggest events of the year.And I think you'll see as that rolls out, a program that's been around for a while, continued innovation and ways to engage our guests in new ways, so we're excited to get that going.Kate McShane: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Neil here on for Oliver. I would love to hear more about your thoughts on the broader beauty consumer. Someone made a comment about consumers are being less focused on pricing and kind of trading around different price points, so just curious how that behavior holds against the different macro headwinds you mentioned, particularly student loans? What's your exposure to that? Or how do you quantify that impact as we get closer to the October time frame when that becomes more material? Thanks.Dave Kimbell: Yes. Well, I'd say first of all, we're just pleased overall with the continued engagement that beauty enthusiasts are showing for this category. Coming out of the pandemic for these last a couple of years now, just a high level of engagement. You know how over the long-term, last 50 years, this has been a strong grow -- consistently growing category because of the emotional connection that it plays in our guest lives, the importance it has and how they express themselves to the world, and that is more true now than ever. And some of the behaviours and engagement tools that emerge coming out of the pandemic continue to fuel the category. Strong innovation, strong connection through marketing and consumer tools and an increased understanding of the role of beauty to wellness and self-care.So when we look at the consumer going forward, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for this category and the strength of the beauty enthusiast to fuel it going forward. As I mentioned in the -- in my comments, there's a lot of uncertainty, and there has been, frankly, for the last couple of years. But we look into the remainder of this year, we know we're lapping. We continue to lap strong growth. We've been on this strong category growth for a while now. We have more changes coming, including student loans. So we're cautious and certainly watching carefully how that evolves. Historically, it's been difficult to tease out any kind of economic or stimulus shift and how directly that impacts the category or our business, and our business and the category itself has been largely resilient.Not immune, but largely resilient. So when we look out, I guess I'd say we're optimistic but watching closely and carefully. Staying really close to our guests, understanding what's happening in their lives and what's influencing their decisions and making sure we're adapting. Last thing I'd say and I know I've said this many times, but our position, our unique model of having all price points and a really accessible experience, both in-store and online positions us well. So even if there's shifts, even if there are pressures on consumers, history says we are able to adapt, and I know that's the strategy that we're implementing to make sure we're here for our guests to deliver regardless of what goes on in the broader environment around them.Kiley Rawlins: Paul, I think we have time for maybe one more question.Operator: Thank you. Our final question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your queen.Steven Forbes: Good afternoon. Dave, Scott, you both mentioned in your prepared remarks the expectation for promotions to remain well below 2019 levels. And I was hoping you could just maybe clarify that statement? Is it isolated in 2023? Or is it meant to be a longer-term comment? And as we think about merchandise margin risk in the model, is there any way to frame what the sort of structural change in promotional activity in the category means for the margin profile in and of itself?Scott Settersten: Yes. So when we're talking -- again, this has been an evergreen topic, I think, with investors now for quite a while, pointing back to 2019. So the business is in a much different position today than it was back in 2019. Again, for those that have been following 2019, we had some major disruption in the middle of the year in the Makeup category, unexpected deceleration there. There were channel mix headwinds that we were dealing with as a business. There was some investment in some international expansion that was causing some significant deleverage on the business. And so during the course of the pandemic, some initiatives that have been started pre-pandemic. But during the pandemic, we were able to take advantage of making sure that we fully leverage some of our cost optimization initiatives by way of ESG, and now continuous improvement initiatives layered on top of that.I would say the scale of the business, much larger today than it was back in 2019. So we're going to get the benefit of the fixed store cost leverage in the base business far and above what we were looking at pre-pandemic. Things around our capabilities like ship-from-store and focus capabilities that really did not exist in any meaningful way back in 2019 that now you heard us say again today. 30% of those digital sales are being serviced out of our store fleet, so a much more efficient delivery to the consumer and a much better overall margin profile of those sales. Things like our credit card program, our Ulta Beauty and Target relationship. UB Media, new business for us, just really out of the starting gate here over the course of the last year, puts us in a much better position overall than we were back in those days.So again, that's not promotion directly, but those -- all those elements play a role in gross margin and operating margin and expanding that over the course of time. So we feel confident that the promotion levels, again, they are going to moderate. We've been talking over the last couple of years that extraordinary environment that we saw in '21 in '22 was not sustainable for the long term. And that -- as people got back in the business and people were back in malls and other retail outlets that the promotion level was probably going to come back to us a little bit, and that's kind of how -- what we're seeing play out today. So again, there's nothing unexpected here. It was in our forecast, our plans for the year. We're moderating and navigating our way through that in an effective manner, and again, nothing -- I don't think anything that should be overly concerning to investors.Again, we're confident that we're going to be able to manage our way through that with new capabilities, new lines of business, our loyalty program and CRM capabilities being much more mature today than they were back in the pre-pandemic days. So we're confident we're going to be able to deliver healthy operating margins in that 14% to 15% range and a very moderate growth expectation of 3% to 5%. So feeling good about our position and where we're headed for the future.Steven Forbes: Thank you for that.Dave Kimbell: Great. Thank you all for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and engagement in Ulta Beauty. I want to close by thanking all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued care for our guests while delivering another quarter of strong financial results. We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the third quarter on November 30. Thanks again, and have a good evening.Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

A surge was seen in their demand after COVID-19 because it made their users feel more protected. According to a report from avian data firm WingX, there were 5.5 million private jet flights in the year 2022. This was more than double the flights in the year 2020.Private jet companies have completely changed the outlook of air travel with their consistent pursuit of innovation and technology, offering a wide variety of popular jet aircraft to their clients. Some of the top private jet-selling public companies include Jet.AI Inc.

The owner of Tesla and Corporation X, Elon Musk, bought a new private jet and made 171 flights in the year 2022. Story continuesThe CEO of PrivateFly, Adam Twidell, says,“.... your itinerary is completely flexible based on your needs. Since many private-jet customers tend to be business travelers, this is a huge advantage, especially when important meetings run longer than expected, the aircraft will still be at the airport waiting for you, rather than needing to book a new flight as you would with a commercial airline.”  The private jet market has been steadily increasing for some time now.

Similarly, Jet Finder states that the US alone has 65% of private jets, while Europe has approximately 15% of private jets. The private jet market in 2021 was about $30 billion which is expected to go beyond $40 Billion by the year 2028.Amongst this surge in their demand, every aircraft manufacturer claims to produce the best jet.

253,5cdb595c-c46b-3645-b2b5-ffb39fdd02da,KO,2023-08-26,The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 62% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-company-nyse-ko-120024629.html,1693051224,STORY,['KO'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Coca-Cola's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownershipUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyIf you want to know who really controls The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 62% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Coca-Cola already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Coca-Cola, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Coca-Cola. The company's largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 7.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Coca-ColaThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that The Coca-Cola Company insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.7b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Coca-Cola. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 9.2% of Coca-Cola stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Coca-Cola is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

You can skip our analysis of the global economic power dynamics, and head over directly to the 10 Most Economically Powerful Countries in the World.As the old adage goes, there is no free lunch. Large and prosperous economies around the world have used development assistance, or simply foreign aid, as a foreign policy tool to expand their national interests. While in doing so they have without doubt contributed to improving human welfare, but the primary motive behind channeling billions of dollars to weaker, developing countries has always been to receive something back in return. Aid has been used to reward friendly countries for their compliant policies, and aid has been withdrawn to destabilize nations with antagonistic regimes.Abubacarr Tambadou, Gambia’s Justice Minister in 2020 took Aung San Suu Kyi to the world court in The Hague over the persecution faced by Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, but it is hard to conceive that an African country would seek to do the same with any Chinese leader over the happenings in Xinjiang province with Uyghurs, primarily due to hefty development aid a number of African countries receive from China. Pakistan pulled out of the 2019 summit of Muslim nations hosted by Malaysia after Saudi Arabia and UAE expressed reservations about Islamabad joining the meeting, which they felt could rival the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Both of these countries host large Pakistani expatriate communities and have repeatedly assisted Pakistan in times of financial distress.Similarly, powerful countries have also used foreign investments as a means of pursuing foreign policy goals by expanding their cultural influence. Due to the size and strength of their economies, these countries are home to some of the world’s largest corporations with funds available to expand geographically. One much talked about example in the last century has been the global expansion of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). After American troops went overseas for World War II, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) vowed to make Coke available for the soldiers wherever they were and began building bottling stations on the Western Front and the Pacific.Story continuesAfter the war was over, the company started expanding its operations across Europe and Asia, and that marked the beginning of a concept that came to be known as ‘coca-colonization’ – a term that signified the Americans pushing forward their ideals in areas under their sphere of influence. In 1948, the French government openly stood against the drink and even accused The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) of being an espionage network. As of 2015, Coca-Cola is distributed in more than 200 countries. Coca Cola is considered to be the second-most commonly understood word in the world after ‘okay’ according to the company's website.Another brand that rode the coattails of America’s economic and cultural dominance is Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI). It is hard to imagine any garment today that is as widely embraced and worn across the world as jeans are. First designed in the 19th century by Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI) for laborers, jeans, despite gaining popularity in the decades that followed, were worn only in the western states of the US till World War II. Soon the trend caught up among middle class Americans and started to gain popularity in Europe as well where American soldiers often wore Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI)’s jeans when they were off duty. Jeans represented symbols of democratization and a happy, prosperous American way of life for the Europeans.Fast food culture is also widely seen as a representation of American marketing dominance. Brands such as McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM)'s KFC and Pizza Hut have thousands of outlets around the world today. China has the most Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM)’s KFC restaurants in the world. India is the second largest market for Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) after the United States, while China and Japan race to claim second spot for the most McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) outlets by country.MethodologyWe have ranked the 30 most economically powerful countries in the world using two metrics: nominal GDPs of these countries in 2022 and the average foreign aid given by these nations to developing countries between 2020 and 2022. Data measuring the size of the GDP has been sourced from the IMF, while OECD's Net ODA Database and other reliable and independent sources were studied to get figures related to the foreign aid these countries gave out. Equal weightage has been given to both metrics and then summed to get an aggregated score. We have listed countries in this article in ascending order of those scores.30 Most Economically Powerful Countries in the WorldS-F/Shutterstock.comLet’s now head over to the list of the most economically powerful countries in the world.30.

We had a very strong fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We grew full year revenue 13%, delivered strong operating margin expansion, and exited the year with momentum. Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our platform and the diversity of our portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times. This past year, we expanded our operating margin again, while investing in the most important areas to drive durable long-term growth. We are guiding to another year of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion in fiscal year 2024, even with the macroeconomic environment that is uncertain.We are entering Intuit's most exciting area. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core fueling innovation across our five Big Bets. We've made strong progress in transforming from a tax and accounting platform where consumers and small businesses have to do the work to achieve the benefit that they are seeking, to a global financial platform, where we do the hard work for them. Now, we are creating a future of, done for you, a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers to fuel their financial success. This future is only possible because of our history of significant investments in our platform, talent, data and AI and now our accelerated investments in generative AI.At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for 100 million customers. For small businesses, we have a 360-degree view of their business and customers. We have 500,000 customers and financial attributes per small business on our platform and this data gives us insights into behaviors, income streams, expenses, profitability, and cash flows, enabling us to provide personalized experiences and recommendations to help them prosper. Additionally, we have 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform, including income, expenses, credit history, spending history, outstanding loans, cash flow, and tax information, which enables us to become a financial assistant in their pocket.We are using our data to fine-tune our own financial large language models that specialize in solving tax, accounting, cash flow, marketing, and personal finance challenges. The investments that we've made in data and AI over the years allow us to introduce innovations at an accelerated rate. Intuit's rich data platform is a powerful foundation that allows us to create innovative AI-assisted experiences for all of our customers powering their prosperity. In June, we introduced our generative AI operating system called GenOS, to ignite innovation at scale for the benefit of millions of consumers and small businesses. GenOS empowers Intuit technologists to create breakthrough generative AI experiences. We are using a platform approach, giving our teams across Intuit the resources and tools they need to design, build, test and deploy these new experiences with unparalleled speed.This includes our own powerful financial LLMs, as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers, in a cost-effective way. We are entering Intuit’s most exciting era yet and believe the next several years will be game changing. On September 6th, we’ll be hosting Intuit Innovation Day, a virtual event where we will unveil exciting GenAI innovation across our platform and how it will drive business growth in the years ahead. We look forward to sharing more with you then. Now, let me turn to our Big Bets which are driving growth and benefits for our customers today. I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress in one of our Big Bets. As a reminder, our five Big Bets are, revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market.Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth, by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization, from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer, to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit, and getting paid upfront, are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 22% total online payment volume growth this quarter. We are making significant progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses, and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 80% of businesses still pay other firms via paper checks.We recently expanded the availability of the beta of our native bill pay solution by 10x. Turning to Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end QuickBooks and Mailchimp customer growth platform. Second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and eCommerce suite. And third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This last quarter, we implemented our first generative AI capability in Mailchimp, the Email Content Generator, enabling customers to create faster email campaigns based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice.This quarter, we launched the beta of a new product announcement generator, which uses AI to automatically create an email that a small business can send to its customers. We also announced over 150 new and updated features at our recent Mailchimp conference in London, designed to support the needs of advanced marketers, including a calendar view, custom reporting and analytics, more e-commerce advanced segmentation, more real time behavioral data based on e-commerce automations, and SMS marketing. Lineup changes and free trials are driving positive trends in year-over-year paid customer growth, which accelerated this quarter. We continue to make progress in mid-market, our 90-day retention rate this quarter the highest it’s been in two years.We have also translated the product into five different languages. We will share more on the outcomes we’re delivering across our five Big Bets at our Investor Day. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our products, we are moving at high velocity. This will help us put more money in our customers’ pockets, save them time, and ensure complete confidence in every financial decision they make. As we lead this next technological shift, we are well positioned to power prosperity for our customers and communities that we serve with a leadership team that is built for the era of AI. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep. It’s great to have you on the call, my friend.Sandeep Aujla: Thank you, Sasan. I'm excited to be here and I look forward to meeting many of you in the future. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2023, including total revenue growth of 13%, strong margin expansion, and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% and 22% respectively. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we delivered results that exceeded the high-end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $2.7 billion, up 12%. GAAP operating income of $17 million versus a loss of $75 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $627 million versus $433 million last year up 45%. GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $0.32 versus a loss of $0.20 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.65 versus $1.10 last year, up 50%.Now turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 24% for the full year, which included four points of benefit from a full year of Mailchimp's revenue this year versus three quarters last year. Online ecosystem revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 30% for the full year. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 22% in Q4 and 26% in fiscal '23. Growth for the quarter and fiscal year were driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shifts.Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services grew 20% in Q4 driven by payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking. For the full fiscal year, '23 QuickBooks Online Services grew 34% driven by Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in this quarter reflects an increase in customers' adopting our payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue grew mid-teens in Q4. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offering to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer.Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q4 and 31% in fiscal '23. The power of our small business platform continues to resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow across all types of economic environments. Our platform remains critical to our customers' success and we continue to see them adopt multiple offerings across the platform to manage their business.Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the low 20s. We are approximately two-thirds of the way through a three-year transition for customers that remained on license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. We also raised our desktop prices across multiple products last September, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem revenue growth next year as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. Our focus is to continue building out our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst longer-term.Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth of 15% to 20% per year in long term. Now shifting to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $424 million in Q4, down 11%. On a product basis, the decline in Q4 was driven primarily by macroeconomic headwinds in personal loans, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money. Full year revenue was $1.6 billion down 9%. Credit Karma represented 11% of Intuit's total revenue in fiscal '23. We have seen continued stability across our core verticals, which led to the improvement in year-over-year performance during Q4 versus Q3. For context, credit cards and personal loans represented nearly 50% and nearly 30% of Credit Karma’s revenue in fiscal '23, respectively.Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Credit Karma annual revenue growth of 20% to 25% per year long term. Now shifting to Consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $4.1 billion in fiscal '23, up 6%. Each tax season has been unique since the pandemic began four years ago, introducing volatility into Consumer Group results. However, average annual trends over this four-year period are more in line with the long-term trends. Over the past four years, Consumer Group revenue increased by an average of 10% annually, which aligns with our long-term growth expectations of 8% to 12%. While this was a unique tax season, I am proud of the progress the team made by transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live, which grew revenues 17% this year, while customers grew 12%.Looking ahead, we are confident in multiple growth drivers. First, we see a large runway ahead of us with TurboTax Live, given our ability to use both GenAI and human experts powered by AI to deliver confidence for our customers. We are investing in scaling our full-service offering, which has a good product market fit based on the highest product recommendation scores of any product at Intuit this year. Second, we are trying to scale our business tax offering, following a successful pilot this year. And third, we see significant opportunities ahead, driving Credit Karma members to TurboTax and giving TurboTax filers faster access to their money with Credit Karma Money. Given the growth opportunities I just shared, we continue to expect annual Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% per year over the long term.Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue was $561 million in fiscal '23, up 3%. Now let me share more on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments and $6.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. Approximately $4.2 billion of the debt is maturing over the next 15 months and we are evaluating refinancing opportunities subject to market and other conditions. We repurchased $465 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $2 billion during fiscal '23. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim to be -- is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share payable on October 17, 2023.This represents a 15% increase versus last year. We recently finalized our three and one year strategic plan. I feel confident in the investments we are making to drive durable growth, including executing across our Big Bet and continuing the accelerated pace of innovation, particularly with GenAI. We have a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. We manage for the short and the long-term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. Our fiscal 2024 guidance includes total company revenue of $15.89 billion to $16.105 billion, a growth of 11% to 12%.Our guidance includes revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, 7% to 8% for the Consumer Group, and a decline of 3% to a growth of 3% for Credit Karma. GAAP earnings per share of $9.37 to $9.67, growth of 11% to 15%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $16.17 to $16.47 growth of 12% to 14%. We expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2024. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '24 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.15 to $0.21, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.94 to $2. We are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '24, we expect to pay approximately $700 million in cash tax payments related to fiscal '23, which were deferred due to the IRS disaster-area tax relief.You can find a full fiscal 2024 and Q1 guidance details in our press release as well as on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Sasan.Sasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you. And wrapping up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress with our five Big Bets, the investments that we are making in GenAI and our leadership team driving our platform innovation. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. In today's uncertain macro-environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and mission-critical than ever to our customers. I look forward to your attendance at our Intuit Innovation Day on September 6th, and Investor Day on September 28th. With that, let's open it up to your questions.See also 17 Highest Paying Countries for Lawyers and Top 20 Smartest Dog Breeds Ranked.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and a really nice quarter, and nice to see a forward EPS guide ahead kind of where consensus was to see those numbers start moving up. My inbox getting filled up with questions about the consumer business and the consumer guide. You've talked about a longer-term 8% to 12% growth there, the four-year CAGR of 10%, but this year you are looking for 7% to 8%, so below that guidance framework. And I think what people are trying to understand is why that is? Last year was a difficult tax season. Did you pull the levers too hard on pricing? Or what was it, do we need to refill the tank in terms of units like? What is it that's going to keep this tax season to be underperforming those longer-term targets? Thank you.Sasan Goodarzi: Hey, Keith, thank you for your question. Let me give you the headline, but allow me to unpack it. I think the headline is we are just simply being prudent. Our focus on future growth and our bullishness does not change at all. Let me unpack that. First and foremost, when you look at the assisted segment, there is a $30 billion TAM, and $20 billion of it is consumer-assisted segment and $10 billion of it is business segment. And the second is the secular shift towards digitization will continue and only accelerate in the years to come. And with that as context, we probably saw some of our biggest green shoots this year, which is why we are probably more bullish about what's possible in this business than we were even three to four years ago, and I would put it in two buckets, Credit Karma and then the assisted segment.In Credit Karma, just as a reminder, our vision from the moment that we bought Credit Karma was to create one consumer platform where a consumer can manage their financial lives, manage their money, and get their taxes done in one place. After several years of just rapid experimentation, we had a massive breakthrough this past year where our customer growth within the Credit Karma platform versus a number of Credit Karma members who became TurboTax customers was up 5x and we are scaling that both on the product side and on the business model side as that gives us a lot of confidence going into next year and beyond. The second is going to be assisted segment and that's in three parts. First and foremost is we actually had product market fit this past year at full service, our biggest focus was how do we scale.We had some breakthroughs in how to scale. In fact, as you heard from Sandeep, we had our best product recommendations score of any product across the company and we are significantly leaning into that in the coming year. The second is business tax. We launched and learned to get the product market fit in business tax. That is not going to be available, both across our QuickBooks Live platform and directly going to market with TurboTax and we have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, will come to TurboTax looking for business tax. We've never had an offering. We will next year and we are scaling it. The last thing, I would say in the assisted segment, one of the biggest things that we've learned in the last year is local matters.What that means, people will go on Google, and they will search, if I'm in San Diego is there a pro close to me, while we've never been good been found and local and in fact, when you look at the experts that we have, we are 10 miles from every home in household in the United States and so we're going big on local this year. And so when I look at our green shoots in the assisted segment and in Credit Karma, it gives us a lot of confidence as we look at this coming year and the future and I'll end with where I started, was the essence of your question about our guidance, we're simply being prudent given the year that we just had.Keith Weiss: Excellent. That’s it for me. Thank you.Sasan Goodarzi: Thank you.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open.Siti Panigrahi: Thank you. Great quarter and Sandeep, congratulations on your first earnings call and looking forward to working with you. Sasan, I want to ask about your bill pay, what sort of feedback have you been getting from your beta customer from the QuickBooks native bill pay? And how should we think about the near-term opportunity as you're switching the legacy powered by payment solution with now your native bill pay? And then on the broader vision side on small business, now that you have full end-to-end cash flow management, now you have AR invoice payment and AP bill pay, then you have money bank accounts. So what is your broader vision in terms of that monetizing the whole ecosystem?Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Siti, thank you for your question. Let me take it in two parts. First and foremost, you've heard us in the past year plus talk about digitizing B2B with respect to all of the manual work that gets done today in terms of 80% of the back and forth between small businesses is all sort of paper checks and manual. And our goal has been to digitize all of that. And one last element of what we needed to do was to launch bill pay. I think the headline I would just give is -- the feedback we've been getting has even gone better than what we thought, and we're now at a place where we are 10x-ing our beta, and we hope to have it available to all of our customers soon. So we feel very good about what we are seeing in Bill Pay and how fast we're able to build it based on the platform capabilities that we have and the feedback that we've gotten from customers.I think back to your second question, you're right. And in fact, the vision I would take you back to is that we have set out to be the source of truth for a business and to truly be the center of small business growth. And in order to do that, we have to have capabilities that not only help a small business grow their customers, retain their customers, market to their customers, but to be able to manage their cash flow and be able to manage their employees. We now have all of those capabilities end-to-end. And I think particularly, what's important, that advantages us to deliver for our customers is the data and our AI investments that we've made in the last five-plus years. And I think I would just encourage you to attend -- and if you can attend when it's on real time, watch the replay of our September 6 Intuit Innovation Day.And you will see how with our data, AI and GenAI capabilities we help customers manage their cash flow and really digitize all of money movement in a way that's so intuitive, so easy and delivered at a moment of truth. So we're quite excited about what's possible as we look at this coming year, about the years ahead. And let me, by the way, be very explicit that none of our potential innovation that you're going to experience in September 6 around GenAI is included in our guidance. But we believe it is fundamentally revolutionary as we think about the world we're going to create in the future.Siti Panigrahi: Thank you. Thanks, Sasan.Sasan Goodarzi: You’re very welcome.Operator: And our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.Brent Thill: Sasan, when you mentioned prudent in the tax guide. I'm curious, are you baking in more wiggle room this year than in past years in the guidance or can you just walk through what you mean by prudent?Sasan Goodarzi: Sure. Great question. Well, first of all, I'll just take you back to what you already know, but I think it's important that we start there. This past year, IRS returns, we continue to estimate we'll be down a couple of points. The do-it-yourself category will be down nearly 1 point. And the driver of that, which we are now certain of, based on all the working analysis that we've done, is we had a number of folks that came in to get their stimulus dollars and tax credits, and so it was pandemic driven. And so that created just what you heard from Sandeep, a sort of a very unusual tax season. But then when you step back and look at the last four-year trend, it sort of straightened out. And so what we mean by prudent is really a couple of things.One, we're not assuming IRS growth in our numbers this year, and we're not banking on all of the innovation that I just shared paying off this coming year. And that's just part of us being prudent because we want to demonstrate to all of you that this is a business that grows 8% to 12%. And by doing so, we must deliver the results. And so it's just being very intentional and very prudent. As we think about, by the way, our guidance holistically, it's not just TurboTax, it's TurboTax, it's Credit Karma and the way we thought about Small Business. But those are -- that's the sort of the definition of what we mean by prudent.Brent Thill: Thank you, Sasan.Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. You’re very welcome.Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.Michael Turrin: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. You delivered outsized margin expansion this past year. You've mentioned a focus on cost controls, given the tougher environment throughout the year, realize it's one of the guiding principles, but maybe, Sandeep, if you can just speak to what's allowing you to guide for continued margin expansion as a starting point here? And maybe how we should think about what's allowing for continued margin expansion as you break into the upper 30s there on the operating margin side? Thanks.Sandeep Aujla: Thanks for the question, Michael. And let me unpack it a little bit. We go through a [indiscernible] planning process, as I shared in the prepared remarks. And due that process, if you look at one of the biggest needle movers to deliver growth both in the near term and the long term, so durable growth levers for the company. And we make sure those are funded for success, inclusive of Big Bets and investments in GenAI. So the 40 to 60 bps of guidance reflects those investments and, quite frankly, reflects the strength and resilience of our platform. As a reminder, this is an expansion we're delivering on top of the 3.5 points of expansion we delivered over the last three years. As I look ahead, I see plenty of runway for us to continue to operate in accordance with our financial principles to grow expenses slower than revenue, therefore, implying a margin expansion.And really, as I look at it, what gives me confidence is that we are an AI-driven expert platform, and we operate as an ecosystem across technology, across customer success, across marketing. So in addition to giving us a competitive advantage for having faster time to market as a -- from opting as an ecosystem, it also gives us advantage in getting operating leverage as we scale as a business.Michael Turrin: Thank you.Operator: Our next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Your line is open.Taylor McGinnis: Yeah. Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe I'll focus on the Small Business and Self-Employed full year guide, which was really strong. So I know there's a bunch of moving pieces in there between customer ads, mix shift, online services attach and price. But are you able to help us understand how each of those levers are contributing to the guide? And based on what you're seeing in the environment, what's giving you comfort and the durability of those growth drivers?Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you for your questions. Let me start us off and Sandeep, please jump in if you want to add anything. First of all, we have a framework at the company level where we want to drive the majority of our growth from volume and mix and the lesser part from price, but we always focus on pricing for value. And so when we look at our growth drivers this year, it is coming from customer growth, and it is coming from mix and to a lesser extent this year compared to last year, by the way, from price. With that as context, I would just remind you that the big picture, when you look at our opportunity this coming year, but even in the next three to five years plus, we now have a platform and a portfolio of services where we have the opportunity to drive further adoption of our services from Mailchimp to payments, to payroll to time tracking and to a lot of our new innovations around Bill Pay and digitizing B2B that I just mentioned.But also, although we are three to four years in, we're just at the beginning of what's possible in the midmarket. Big market is a significant ARPC opportunity because these customers use a lot of the capabilities that I just mentioned, except they pay a lot more. And we're just at the beginning of the flywheel of penetrating mid-market. So when you look at the portfolio of the services that we have, the strength of the experience that we're delivering because of data and AI and because of mid-market, it allows us to drive most of our growth from customer growth and mix. And none of that, by the way, takes into account what's possible as we look into the future with our generative AI experiences that you'll be able to observe on September 6.But those are the main drivers.Sandeep Aujla: And Taylor, I would add, over the long term, we remain committed to our growth algorithm of 10% to 20% ARPC and customer growth. That remains unchanged. And really, as Sasan mentioned, is our innovation across our platform that gives us -- opens up the aperture for us to cross-sell and upsell our customers across more offerings on our platform as those opportunities for us to price for value as we look ahead.Taylor McGinnis: Great. Thank you.Sasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.Kim Watkins: Raiza, we’re ready for our next question.Operator: And our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Kash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. I hope you can hear me okay. So the recession that everybody's been expecting, it doesn't seem to be quite happening. Sasan, I know you've got a great read on your SMB ecosystem. What are some of the indicators that you're seeing? And if you've already proactively addressed this, my apologies for bringing it up again. But what are some of the forward-looking indicators that you see in the Credit Karma business or the SMB ecosystem that give you renewed confidence that we are going to be okay? Because your fiscal '24 guidance definitely is not reflecting of any caution in the environment, but more like a continuation of what we've seen in the last four quarters. Just some thoughts there would be great. Thank you so much and congrats.Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. Thank you for your question. And you're loud and clear, my friend. So let me start with Small Business. And generally, I would just lead with they continue to be healthy, but they're challenged in this environment. The specifics that I would share is the cash flow -- cash reserves of Small Businesses is 90% of what it was this time last year. However, it is still stronger than pre-pandemic. The -- in terms of looking for labor and finding employees to drive their growth, that's still quite strong. And in fact, in this environment, Small Businesses are able to do a better job finding what they need versus when the market was hot, which is good for them because then they can deliver for their customers and drive growth.And the last thing I would just say is there are certain sectors that are very weak, transportation, real estate, advertising, is very weak within small businesses. So that's the aggregate picture. I'll end with what where I started, struggling, but still healthy compared to pre-pandemic. On the consumer side, let me hit on sort of two different points. I'll quickly hit on Credit Karma. As you know, Sandeep mentioned, what we're seeing is stability and our innovation that we've been focused on is really getting hold, and there's some exciting things that we're working on in Credit Karma that we'll share both on September 6 and at Investor Day, one where we redesigned the entire app. And we have begun to roll it out to a small cohort of customers and will eventually scale it.And we're actually seeing very good engagement with the redesigned app. And then that, coupled with our GenAI experiences, along with all of our innovation with Lightbox and Credit Karma Money gives us a lot of excitement around the future, none of which, by the way, is in our guidance. But the headline is stability in Credit Karma and lots of innovation that is helping us with where we are and coming. If I just focus on the consumer, a couple of things I would say. If you look back to last March of 2022, credit scores are, on average, down 13 points. Credit balances are up about 30%. And the credit band of like [600 to 660] (ph) have the largest balances. They're carrying about $10,000 on average. And the Gen Z balances have gone up the most, are up 45% year-over-year.So job market is still good. People still have jobs, but there's certainly some level of strain on the consumer.Kash Rangan: Brilliant. Thank you so much.Sasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open.Brad Reback: Great. Sasan, following up on that Credit Karma commentary. Obviously, the world we live in today is different than when you acquired the business. Do you think the long-term growth rate of Credit Karma is meaningfully different in a world where interest rates are mid-single digits versus zero? Thanks.Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Brad, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We're very bullish on the business. And in fact, a couple of things that I would share with you, which we can talk more about at Investor Day, but just not to leave you hanging, the monetization model in Credit Karma is how many members you have, how frequently they engage. And there's a model for -- every time a customer engages, there is a average revenue per customer that we benefit from. And in fact, this past year, in '23, when our results were down year-over-year, our frequency of engagement is actually higher than the prior two years where we had 37% growth and 58% growth. Now why is that? It's because of all of our innovation. It's because the customer is engaging but in many areas, credit is still tight.So when credit begins to open up, and that's the stability that we're seeing now, we view this business will accelerate back to the 20% to 25% growth rate. Plus I'll remind you that, that plus the integration with TurboTax drives actually more stickiness, more monetization and truly created this one consumer platform, which was our vision from day one when we acquired Credit Karma. And with all of the data and AI capabilities that we have in our accelerated GenAI experiences, as I said earlier, you're going to see on September 6, some of the new innovations that are coming that will make it easier for customers to find what they need, the benefits that they need to engage in the financial products that they want and manage their money. And so all of that leads to our view is completely unchanged relative to the long-term expectations of 20% to 25% growth in Credit Karma.Sandeep Aujla: And Brad, the one thing I would add to this because you asked about a scenario in which interest rates are higher. When interest rates are higher, the consumer have a higher propensity to shop around because even a small improvement in the rates that they're getting, has a bigger difference in terms of the interest rate they're paying and a bigger difference to their bottom line. So in fact, the product becomes more important critical to the end user in a higher rate environment.Brad Reback: That’s great. Thank you very much.Sasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.Operator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.Kartik Mehta: Good evening, Sasan. This year, you're really focused, at least from a TV advertising standpoint on full service, really trying to get the message out. And I'm wondering, one of the things you talked about is being a little bit more prudent on revenue growth on the consumer business. I'm wondering are -- will your strategy change at all and how you're marketing the full-service product? And how did the full-service product perform compared to your expectations this quarter as well -- this year as well?Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Great question. Let me give you an answer that I think you'll find somewhat helpful and somewhat vague intentionally. We learned a lot this year. We came into the year with a full service offering that has product markets, that as you know, it's all AI-driven. And we can virtually get things done within an hour or same day. We learned a lot around health and scaling and how to have customers find our full-service offering. And a lot of it also has to do with what I mentioned earlier, which is local marketing. If I'm in San Diego, if I'm in Kansas City, even if I see that TurboTax can provide experts, I go to start to see locally if there's somebody there. Well, all of our experts that we have are within 10 miles of many of the households in the United States, but we've never marketed that way.And so that's going to inform our marketing going forward. So there's a lot that we learned in terms of how to evolve our marketing, so it becomes an and, and not an either/or, and we're excited about it.Kartik Mehta: Thank you.Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Very welcome.Operator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.Kirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much. Sasan, I'd love to hear you just give a little bit more detail on what you're counting on Mailchimp to do this year and maybe not if you don't want to get too much into the quantitative side. Qualitatively, you guys have done a lot of work around the product, the monetizaiton. How important is sort of a continued acceleration of Mailchimp as you look at sort of the small business in aggregate for next year? Thanks.Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Kirk, thank you for your question. It's really -- to answer your question, it's really threefold. First and foremost, as you know, we made this acquisition ultimately to create one growth platform, so we can help a small business in one place, be able to grow their business and manage their cash flow and manage their workforce all in one place. And really the key to all of this has been data, AI and now our accelerated investments in GenAI. And so first and foremost is we want to make significant progress in this area, and you'll actually see some of this on both September 6, our Intuit Innovation Day and at Investor Day. That's number one. The second is, as I mentioned earlier, we had the largest release in June that we've ever had in Mailchimp's history.We had 150 new and updated features that we released on top of the multiple GenAI-driven announcements that we had made a couple of weeks prior to that. So our second focus is adoption, getting our customers to adopt these benefits because not only will it help fuel their success, but it will help us with monetization, particularly in the mid-market, which is where our focus is very similar to the focus that we've had with QuickBooks' mid-market. And then third is international. Mailchimp is the lead horse internationally. And we've done a lot to localize the product. I mentioned earlier in the five languages and more is coming. We've also been doing a lot of price studies and price testing because we've had like one class price internationally.That doesn't work. Some countries should be higher, some countries should be lower. And so we've learned a lot in terms of some of our testing and many of that we're going to be scaling this year. So those are -- if I were to just sort of carve out your question, those are the three big areas that we are very focused on in the coming years.Kirk Materne: Great. Thanks, Sasan.Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. You’re welcome.Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Nick Giovacchini: Hi, everyone. It’s Nick Giovacchini on for Brad this evening. Congratulations on the strong end to the year, and welcome, Sandeep. I appreciate you taking the question. International growth has decelerated since the beginning of the year. Can you talk us through how you see that growing going forward? Thanks.Sandeep Aujla: Thanks for the question, Nick. A couple of things on the international growth. On international growth, as I shared earlier, our focus, our refreshed strategy is to lead with both Mailchimp and QuickBooks in the markets where we have product market fit. And in other areas to lead with Mailchimp at the tip of the spear. Our growth decelerated for a couple of reasons, and some of that Sasan shared. As we lead into rightsizing the pricing for Mailchimp in some of these geographies, historically, it was the same price. It was basically the price in the US simply converting into the local currency and applied in that geography. We went in, and we looked at what the price should be based on the competitors in the market, based on the GDP per capital and all these other factors and we rightsized the price.Secondly, as we do in QuickBooks, we introduced free trials or discounts initially when folks join the product is what we have experienced over our years of doing that is people -- more people come into the product and they stick around. That leads to a better 90-day forwarded retention, et cetera. These are all the factors and all the improvements we're making in the Mailchimp product and the lineup, which is leading to what I would describe as a temporary headwind in terms of our international growth.Nick Giovacchini: Great. Thank you very much.Sasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.Alex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on a really nice and prudent guidance methodology for next year. I guess maybe I'll just -- I want both of my questions to really target the SMB growth rate. It seems like the guide there ex Mailchimp is really strong. Sandeep you're now in the CFO seat, maybe just talk about -- you talked about the prudence intact, but the prudence in the SMB guide, what gives you guys the confidence to kind of guide that way? How much of it has to do with some of the payment functionalities that are coming to market, some of the GenAI functionality that's coming to market, what gives you guys that guidance? And then dovetailing into that, new leadership for that group, obviously, as well. Is there talk about the potential for either disruption or how is that accounted for? Or why Mariana was the right fit for that role specifically and kind of where -- what you're going to bring to the table in?Sasan Goodarzi: Alex, can I take the leadership question and take it more broadly and then let Sandeep jump in and answer specifically your question around the guide. Let me take this opportunity to talk about the leadership changes that we've had in the company. And I'll, of course, include Mariana in that as well. First of all, one of our greatest superpowers as a company is leadership development and succession planning. One of the focus areas that we have as part of our Intuit operating system, which starts at the top with my staff and staff is we spend four times a year, several days at a time, focusing on talent, focusing on succession planning, reviewing development plans and being very intentional about architecting mobility moves.And ultimately, our goal is to be 3D in all of our key roles at multiple levels in the company, which, by the way, is very hard to do. But that is why we are a leadership factory. The second thing I would say is that we are very focused on mobility of senior roles, so the Vice President and above, which is an officer of the company and above, typically within a three- to five-year period, there's a lot of it -- you don't have visibility to, of course, because you only see potential changes that happen in my staff. But we're very intentional about mobility because we believe fresh perspective, fresh thinking is important in our technology areas and our businesses and also training the leaders to be ready for a bigger job is very important. By the way, I'll use myself as an example.Before I stepped into the CEO job 4.5 years ago, I was in TurboTax for three years. I was in QuickBook -- running Small Business for three years when I was the CIO for two years. So that's just an example of mobility. With all of that said, sometimes our mobility is up and to the right and changes within the company. Sometimes we celebrate folks taking on roles outside of the company because that may be the best fit for them. So with that as context, we have a lot of confidence in our leaders, and let me now specifically touch on our three of the leaders just to make it very real. When you look at Mariana, I actually hired Mariana into Small Business when I was there. She was our Chief Product Development Officer and is very familiar with Small Business.When I became the CEO, I moved her into the CEO role, and she's done an unbelievable job fueling innovation across the company. And now she's going back home to where she started running Small Business. And very excited about what she will do to unlock the next year of growth. When you look at Mark in TurboTax, I actually started with Mark in TurboTax a decade ago. and worked with him for three years. We then -- after I left TurboTax a few years later, promoted him to be our Chief Customer Success Officer of the company. And he is the godfather of our live platform that we talk a lot about today. And now he's going back home and running TurboTax. So he's very well versed not only in the business, but our disruptive growth driver of the future, which is live.And then Alex Balazs, just upon our CTO role, I also worked with him in TurboTax. We then move them to a broader Chief Architect and data role, where he's been Mariana's right-hand person, fueling the innovation across the company. We just moved him into the CTO role. The reason I wanted to go through that a bit fairly is for all of you to understand that succession planning and leadership development is our sort of core competency. And I actually believe that we have the strongest team that we've had ever built for the era of AI given their backgrounds and experiences. So with that as context, let me have Sandeep answer the other part of your question, Alex.Sandeep Aujla: Absolutely. And actually, let me touch on one additional point to what Sasan added, it's never about one individual. We are a system, and we have strong leadership teams around our General Manager and CFO staff as well. So getting back to your question on the guidance, Alex. So just for context, the Small Business group grew 24% in fiscal '23, with four of those points coming from the benefit of the timing of the Mailchimp acquisition. So that's about a 20% organic run rate. And as we have shared with you with -- the group in the past is 80% of the revenues in the Small Business group are subscription-based. So that makes -- so the recurring nature of the revenue makes it highly predictable. And we -- this year's strong results in areas where we are focused, such as QuickBooks Advanced customer growth as well as in the mid-market area that Sasan touched on.So that is one component giving us confidence as we guide for next year. The second aspect is it's the importance of our products to SMBs. This is something core to how they run their business, how they pay their employees, how they get paid themselves, how they get access to capital to take on new projects and grow their business. And we have made tremendous improvements in our product in an ecosystem that makes that platform that much more relevant and important to the lives of our customers. So that is what's all baked into the guidance that we provided for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. You asked a question if we were reliant on GenAI. I want to reiterate and be very clear. GenAI, we believe it will be an accelerator for our business, but that is not baked into the guidance that we shared with you all today.Alex Zukin: Super clear. Thanks a lot, Sandeep and Sasan. It was very in-depth explanation. No doubt the talent factory is alive and well.Sasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Alex.Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig in on Credit Karma, specifically as it relates to the opportunity to begin to pursue prime customers in addition to the subprime and near-prime customers you guys have kind of focused on historically? Thanks.Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you for your question. Yes, it's a big focus area for us going after prime customers. And just for context, it's sort of a third of our monthly active users, and they're the least engaged because really, when you look at the platform, we traditionally focused on subprime and near prime. And we have a lot of the capabilities that we've developed in the past and know these prime customers very well, which is why we have merged our Mint and Credit Karma team and platform to really solve for these prime customers. And so we have been working, I think, for the last almost a year, really understanding their needs, running a number of experiments and are now -- and has been in the midst of launching multiple things that are very geared towards prime customers.And we're actually very excited with the app redesign. There's sort of two big things that we've been working on in Credit Karma beyond what we've been sharing with you. One is really redesigning the whole app to enable customers and certain cohort of customers like Prime to be able to find the benefit that they're looking for because of everything that we know about them proactively. The second is the GenAI experience is that, again, we will unveil more of September 6. And the combination of those two things and what I shared a moment ago around Prime customers gives us a lot of sort of excitement around what's possible to serve these Prime customers going forward, which is something that we've not benefited from a monetization perspective.None of that is included in our guidance, but it's something that we're very excited about.Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for the insight. Looking forward to learning more about it.Sasan Goodarzi: Yep. Thank you.Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open.Brad Sills: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask one on AI here as well. It sounds like some exciting things coming, looking forward to learning more about that. A lot of possibilities here within Small Business and Consumer. Would just love to get your perspective on kind of where you're coming from? Sasan, you've alluded to the fact that Intuit is well prepared here because of the platform capabilities here and the underpinnings of that with data. So just curious, any color as to where Intuit is coming from such that you're able to iterate on AI the way that we're looking forward to learning more about.Sasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you for your question. I'll start with taking you back to five years ago when we declared our strategy was to really shift the company from just a tax and accounting platform, which is a very important set of problems to solve for customers to a global financial platform that really played a far more meaningful role in powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses on a daily basis. When we made that strategic declaration on the five bets that ensued, what we talked about at that time was that data and AI was going to be core to making that shift. And in fact, when we made the acquisition of both Credit Karma and Mailchimp, one huge driver of the acquisition was around the data, because in essence, we will know a lot more about customers, and we could leverage that data for their benefit to fuel their success.So -- and even five years ago declaring this, data and machine learning has been a decade-long focus of Intuit. So when you think about a decade-long investment in data usable data, cleaning the data and making sure that it's structured in a way where it can be used and then our investments in AI, specifically in knowledge engineering, which really takes rules and the relationship between data and turns it in the code is what our advantages in TurboTax, machine learning and natural language processing, those have been -- it's been a decade-long set of investments and the two acquisitions have propelled us forward about 10 years. And then you couple that with what we started several years ago, which is GenAI. And then what we launched in June, which is Generative Operating System, GenOS, which by the way, is not something you can create overnight.This is years of investment. When we couple those kind of investments, data, AI and GenOS, which is really primarily our own Intuit financial large language models that are trained on our customers' proprietary data, it allows us to personalize things, humanize things and do the work for customers in a way that's revolutionary, which ultimately gets to the punch line of we are creating a future that is done for you. Rather than you having to do the work to run your business, rather than you have to do the work to be able to power your prosperity, manage your finances as a consumer, we want to put you in control where it's done for you. You're always in control, you have the taste of whether or not you move forward with a decision. But we want to be able to help you grow your customers and run your business for you and help you manage your cash flow, always put the right choices in front of you.And the same thing goes on the tax side and Credit Karma side. So that's what's so exciting about -- it's a decade-long focus. We really tripled down on it five years ago when we declared our strategy. And we're -- we have now galvanized and energized the entire company that the [future of done for you] (ph) that we declared five years ago is very real, very much here. And we had an enormous opportunity to do amazing things for our customers. And that's what really gets us excited about what's possible. And so I can do another advertisement, join us September 6 for Intuit's Innovation Day, followed by Investor Day, and you'll get a real good feel for the world that we are going to create for the future.Brad Sills: Looking forward to it. Thanks, Sasan.Sasan Goodarzi: You’re welcome.Operator: We'll take our last question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.Scott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Welcome Sandeep. And good afternoon, Sasan. The -- I have a couple on consumer, one very high level and one, just a clarification. So the first is on...Sasan Goodarzi: Scott, you cut out on us.Kim Watkins: Raiza, can you try to bring him back?Operator: Thanks, Scott. Your line is open.Scott Schneeberger: Thanks. Sasan, can you hear me?Sasan Goodarzi: We can now. Yes, if you don't mind start over again, we lost you.Scott Schneeberger: Absolutely. Thanks. So two quick on consumer. First, volume and price mix. Just your consideration of that going into fiscal 2024 and beyond given the trends of the recent years? And then for you or Sandeep, just curious in the extension season in the post-tax season, what did you see? Anything interesting with California? Should we see a shift from fiscal '23 to '24 that's material related to anything extension wise? Thank you.Sasan Goodarzi: Sure. Let me start with your volume mix question around TurboTax. I would say the way to think about it was what I described earlier, leaning into full service, leaning into business tax and continue to lean into TurboTax Live, which really comes with assistance, recognizing it's all data and AI driven. You're going to see more come from ARPC than volume, and that's just the nature of the opportunity. Now there is 88 million-plus people that are in the assisted segment and there's $30 billion of spend. So there's both a volume opportunity and an ARPC opportunity. Just our view, looking at the next 10 years, by the way, this is not a one-year answer, both matter, you're going to get -- we're going to get more from ARPC.And I'll let Sandeep jump in here as well. I mean on the extension season, that's just been very weird with many states that got extended to July and California to October and what we're seeing from customers is they're even gotten confused which month they have to file in their state. So net-net is there's more to file. When you look at it at the company level, it's really not material, but not everybody has filed yet.Sandeep Aujla: And that’s -- that's basically the answer, Scott. It's not material for our Q1. It's been a unique behavior on the taxpayer. But I'll also remind us that last year, we also saw a great deal of extensions by taxpayers. So that's also something to keep in mind as you look at Q1.Scott Schneeberger: Thank you, both.Sasan Goodarzi: All right, everybody. I think that brings our questions or Q&amp;A to an end. So thank you for your wonderful questions. Thank you for spending the time with us. We look forward to seeing you September 6 and -- at our Investor Day. Take good care. Be safe. Bye, everybody.Sandeep Aujla: Thank you, all.Kim Watkins: Goodbye.Operator: Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.]"

261,0e67f366-ff58-3a8f-a133-2606ea2dc7fc,SRE,2023-08-26,Sempra (SRE) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sempra-sre-could-great-choice-154502113.html,1692978302,STORY,['SRE'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Sempra in FocusBased in San Diego, Sempra (SRE) is in the Utilities sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -8.4%. The natural gas and electricity provider is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.6 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.36%. This compares to the Utility - Gas Distribution industry's yield of 3.79% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.67%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.38 is up 3.9% from last year. Sempra has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.93%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Sempra's current payout ratio is 52%, meaning it paid out 52% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.SRE is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.84 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 4.99%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, SRE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

View our latest analysis for General Electric How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Electric is:33% = US$11b ÷ US$32b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.General Electric's Earnings Growth And 33% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that General Electric has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 21% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, General Electric's considerable five year net income growth of 57% was to be expected.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between General Electric's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 52% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is GE worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether GE is currently mispriced by the market.Is General Electric Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?General Electric's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 4.4%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 96% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Moreover, General Electric is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 6.5% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 16% over the same period.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with General Electric's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Estée Lauder Companies is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$23b - US$6.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Estée Lauder Companies has an ROCE of 10%. In isolation, that's a pretty standard return but against the Personal Products industry average of 13%, it's not as good. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies roceIn the above chart we have measured Estée Lauder Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Estée Lauder Companies here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsIn terms of Estée Lauder Companies' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 24% over the last five years. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased.Story continuesThe Bottom LineWe're a bit apprehensive about Estée Lauder Companies because despite more capital being deployed in the business, returns on that capital and sales have both fallen. Investors must expect better things on the horizon though because the stock has risen 14% in the last five years. Either way, we aren't huge fans of the current trends and so with that we think you might find better investments elsewhere.Estée Lauder Companies does have some risks, we noticed   4 warning signs  (and 2 which are a bit concerning)  we think you should know about.While Estée Lauder Companies may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Most investors become fearful when stocks experience major declines, as the common psychological tendency is to believe that the future will be a continuation of the recent past. Share price losses are often a result of bad earnings and extensive bearish comments from analysts and Wall Street pundits. But given enough time, solid companies will usually rebound in price, rewarding courageous investors with substantial profits.Take a look at some real estate investment trusts (REITs) that were high-flyers a short while ago but have since been battered down by economic conditions. For those brave enough to consider them despite blood in the streets, dividend yields of 8% to 10% now make these REITs quite compelling. Don’t Miss: A REIT you’ve probably never heard of is up 36% over the past two years. Here’s how its unique model is crushing the market.Elon Musk's vision and ventures are propelling Austin, Texas into an extraordinary opportunity for investors. Here’s how to invest before he floods it with new tech workers. SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is a New York City-based office REIT and the largest office building landlord in New York. As of June 30, SL Green Realty held interests in 60 buildings totaling 33.1 million square feet. Many income-oriented investors like owning SL Green Realty for its monthly paying dividend.On July 19, SL Green Realty reported its second-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $1.43 was down 23.53% from FFO of $1.87 in the second quarter of 2022 but beat the estimates by $0.09. Revenue of $221.07 million was above estimates of $205.97 million.Story continuesOn Aug. 17, BMO Capital Markets analyst John Kim downgraded SL Green Realty from Outperform to Market Perform, while raising the price target from $32 to $35. Kim noted, “While BMO still sees positive catalysts ahead, they are more incremental in nature.”As recently as March 2022, SL Green Realty traded near $73 per share. Since that time, it has lost 58% of its value. Short interest is still quite high, and analysts are quite bearish on the entire office REIT sector.But SL Green Realty is the largest office landlord in what is still the No. 1 city in America for commerce.

(NYSE: MPW) is a Birmingham, Alabama-based healthcare REIT that owns and operates 444 general acute care and other properties across the U.S. and nine other countries, with locations in Europe and Australia. It has a total portfolio of $19.2 billion, of which 64% are general acute care hospitals, and about two-thirds of its properties are in the United States.On Aug. 8, Medical Properties Trust reported its second-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.48 missed estimates of $0.70 but were an increase of 4.35% from FFO of $0.46 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $337.39 million missed the estimates of $351.38 million and was 15.7% below revenue of $400.23 million in the second quarter of 2022. Medical Properties Trust also reported a net loss of $42 million, versus net income of $190 million a year ago because of the early termination of five Utah hospital leases and a straight-line rent write-off of $95 million.The bad news caused Medical Properties Trust shares to drop by over 14% in one day. Shares continued to slide over the next two days, ending at $8.13 on Aug. 10. But there was more bad news to come for shareholders.On Aug. 11, Raymond James analyst Jonathan Hughes downgraded Medical Properties Trust three levels from Strong Buy to Underperform. Hughes cited underperformance in comparison to other healthcare REITs and the REIT general average performance. Hughes had other concerns about management’s credibility and lack of transparency in disclosing vital information related to Medical Properties’ relationships with its operators. He also wondered whether the dividend is sustainable.The three-level downgrade brought about more selling and later in the day, Bank of America Securities analyst Joshua Dennerlein downgraded Medical Properties Trust from Neutral to Underperform and lowered the price target from $9 to $8.Dennerlein’s concern, like many analysts, has to do with Medical Property Trust’s ongoing exposure to Steward, its top tenant, as well as the absence of clarity on unpaid debt from Prospect Medical Holdings, another top tenant.These concerns are nothing new and began early in 2022 with The Wall Street Journal questioning various business practices in which Medical Properties Trust was loaning money to its operators, who were having difficulty paying rent.Since then, Medical Properties Trust has been one of the worst-performing REITs, declining 68% from its high of $20.89 in January 2022, to its most recent closing price of $6.77.This REIT is clearly not for all, but investors with the courage of a Rothschild can snap up shares at 2023 lows right now and snag an 8.86% dividend yield.Read Next: Operating a fully-booked hotel is beyond stressful, but it’s about to become much more efficient thanks to one startup.

(NYSE: OUT) is a New York-based specialty REIT with 500,000 advertising displays across 70 U.S. markets, using billboard, digital, transit and mobile assets to showcase its clients. Outfront Media’s website claims that its media reaches 70% of all Americans on a weekly basis. Outfront says that it and Lamar Advertising Co. (NYSE: LAMR) are the only specialty REITs that exclusively own advertising space.In March 2022, Outfront Media touched a high of $26.92. Since then, it has declined 59% to its most recent closing price of $11.07.On Aug. 3, Outfront Media reported poor second-quarter operating results. FFO of negative $2.92 missed the estimate of $0.24 by 1,316.67% and was a 1,142.86% decrease from FFO of $0.28 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $468.8 million missed the estimate of $472.7 million and was 4.13% below revenue of $450.2 million in the second quarter of 2022.The second-quarter announcement led to two analyst downgrades and a 20% loss over the first week of August. Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst Ian Zaffino downgraded Outfront Media from Outperform to Perform and JP Morgan analyst Richard Choe downgraded Outfront Media from Overweight to Neutral and lowered the price target from $20 to $14.Analyst Choe noted that despite solid billboard performance, growth has underperformed analyst expectations and there is potential for a weaker second half of 2023.Outfront Media’s transit business in New York City has been the main problem, with Outfront Media expecting an operating income before depreciation and amortization loss of $15 million to $20 million in 2023.Outfront Media pays a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share and an annual dividend of $1.20 per share, which not long ago was below 6% but has now climbed to 10.77%. The next ex-dividend date is Aug. 31.One caveat: The annual dividend is well above the forward FFO of $0.84, so it would not be surprising to see a dividend cut. However, the latest $0.30 dividend was declared on the same day earnings were announced, so Outfront may be feeling confident that it can rebound from its poor showing in the second quarter.This former Google engineer thought real estate investing was too expensive and time-consuming, so he created a better approach.

The FAA has said it will hold runway safety meetings at 90 airports over the next few weeks.In December, a ramp agent was fatally injured at Montgomery Regional Airport in Alabama when the worker was sucked into an engine of an American Airlines regional carrier flight parked at the gate.The flight was operated by Envoy Air, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Airlines and the worker was employed by Piedmont Airlines, another American subsidiary.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued Piedmont Airlines a citation for one serious violation in June for exposing ground crew workers to ingestion hazards while performing aircraft marshalling, wing-walking and baggage-handling tasks.Piedmont faces $15,625 in proposed penalties, the maximum allowed by law.

Due to the pay increase, management expects labor costs to increase in third-quarter 2023.Meanwhile, Allegiant Travel's ALGT traffic report for the month of July was impressive owing to the post-pandemic surge in air-travel demand. Driven by high passenger volumes, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) in July inched up 0.7 points to 91.2% from the year-ago quarter.Read the last Airline Roundup here.Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. The approval of the tentative agreement makes AAL’s pilots eligible for an immediate pay raise in excess of 21% on average. Also, the deal includes provisions aimed at improving pilots’ quality of life. The approval implies that company contributions to retirement plans will increase. The contract becomes amendable on Aug 1, 2027 and includes a provision that the next round of bargaining can begin as soon as November 2026. The four-year contract boosts the overall compensation of AAL pilots by more than 46% over its duration and is valued at $9.6 billion.The deal has provisions for retroactive pay for the first four months of 2023. This implies that $230 million will get reflected as additional expenses in the September-quarter results. Including the expenditures associated with the deal, American Airlines now expects third-quarter cost per available seat mile excluding fuel and net special items or CASM-ex to rise in the 4-6% band on a year-over-year basis (prior guidance: 2-4% year-over-year jump).2. In July, scheduled traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) at ALGT was flat compared with July 2022 levels. Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for scheduled service also decreased marginally from the July 2022 reading. For the total system (including scheduled service and fixed fee contract), Allegiant carried more passengers in July 2023 from the year-ago period’s level. Total departures (scheduled services) increased 3.2% in July 2023 from its year-ago levels. Fuel price per gallon in July is estimated to have been $2.77 compared with $2.64 in June.Story continues3. JetBlue Airways JBLU reportedly aims to hike fares on Spirit Airlines’ SAVE flights by as much as 40% if the $3.8 billion deal materializes. JBLU intends to do away with 24 seats on an average from each of SAVE’s roughly 200 planes to reduce capacity and increase prices. The disclosure may jeopardize the chances of the deal, which was announced in July 2022, going through.

276,b99b353f-f090-30a0-9916-af7ef1a6c21d,AAL,2023-08-26,Labor Day travel: Domestic airfare costs down 11% from 2022,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/labor-day-travel-domestic-airfare-144828629.html,1692974908,VIDEO,"['JBLU', 'LUV', 'UAL', 'DAL', 'AAL']","[Millions of people are expected to travel for Labor Day weekend. While hotel prices have risen in the U.S., airfare and rental car prices are down over 10 percent from 2022, according to a new report from Hopper. Hayley Berg, Hopper Lead Economist, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the state of the economy, holiday travel, and how consumers can get the best deals.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, millions of people are expected to travel for Labor Day weekend next week. And a new report shows you may be getting a cheaper deal. Though hotel prices in the US have risen slightly from last year, airfare and rental car costs are both down over 10% from 2022. That's according to a new report from Hopper.And Hayley Berg, Hopper lead economist, is joining us now to talk through it. So we obviously have seen some moderating prices across the economy. I got to say, I was a little surprised by the moderating prices in airfares in particular because, A, we know there's still a lot of demand. And B, anecdotally, it doesn't feel like those prices have come down. So where is that pressure sort of letting up?HAYLEY BERG: We hear that so often. We're quoting these low prices. But consumers don't feel like they're seeing them. And part of that is some behavioral changes. People are planning trips much more last minute than they did prepandemic, meaning they're missing out on some of the best and lowest prices.But domestic prices are really down driven by the higher supply the airlines are operating at the end of the summer this year, a much earlier peak in summer demand. We saw the majority of folks taking trips in June, July, and early August.So we've entered that low-demand period about a week or two earlier than we have in previous years. All of that is gonna drive airfare down for Labor Day weekend in particular, comes at the end of the summer. It's not always the highest demand long weekend of the summer. And that's really why we're seeing about 225 for airfare down about $75 from what we saw earlier this summer and 4th of July weekend.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: It's really interesting. And as we think about travelers getting ready to perhaps make those flights, catch them, some of them might miss them. That's unfortunate. At the same time, the airlines, are they better equipped now at the end of the summer to really deal with the influx, the volume of demand that they're gonna see?HAYLEY BERG: I would say airlines every day since really the end of 2021 have been increasingly better equipped, better trained to handle the volume of passengers that we're seeing. There was a huge influx of new hiring in 2022. Those people had to be trained. And it's not just the airlines, it's the airports as well. It's the FAA, air traffic control, TSA.So we had a relatively successful summer. We did not see the incredibly high disruption rates we did in 2022. But it is a fact that disruption rates are higher now than they have been. You know, prepandemic, about 25% of flights delayed on departure, between 1% and 2% canceled. That still impacts thousands of passengers a day.JULIE HYMAN: Does it dissuade them from traveling, though, Hayley? I mean, and I take that also with the report that recently came out, I believe, in ""The New York Times"" talking about how many near misses there are because of our air traffic control system. Do we see any kind of hit to travelers sentiment as a result of all of this?HAYLEY BERG: We haven't seen it on the Hopper app. Most of our users are Gen Z, millennials, so they definitely are more focused on travel than some of the older generations have historically been. The most interesting thing we're seeing, though, is that about one in five of our users are paying extra, a little more than $30 additional to buy a disruption protection product when they check out with their flight.That's something that allows them to rebook for free on the next available flight if they're canceled, delayed, or miss a connection. And that right there shows us that though travelers are price conscious-- they continue to check the price of trips many times before they book-- they are prepared to pay a little extra for peace of mind in case they are canceled or have a major disruption in their trip.BRAD SMITH: Are people upgrading? And beyond just buying protection, are they upgrading their experience even after that initial purchase?HAYLEY BERG: We always see travelers upgrading, whether it is selecting seats, moving to a higher cabin class. That's something that's been persistent even since prepandemic. If anything, we've seen the airlines start to make some strategic changes to capture more of this premium demand, expanding their premium, seat selection spaces, in some cases, even removing first class to expand business or premium. So there is definitely a lot of demand for premium out there. But when we poll our users, getting the best price and getting an affordable trip remains their number one priority even ahead of anything like more legroom.]"
277,2d5463d5-f9f4-349a-ad3d-5c70805f2876,AAL,2023-08-26,3 Airline Stocks to Watch Amid Upbeat Passenger Volumes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-airline-stocks-watch-amid-131800982.html,1692969480,STORY,"['UAL', 'AAL', '^GSPC', 'RYAAY']","[With air travel demand bouncing back strongly from the pandemic lows, prospects of stocks in the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry appear bright indeed. It is well documented that air travel demand is particularly strong on the leisure front. What is more encouraging is that international demand made a roaring comeback.The decline in fuel expenses represents another tailwind for the industry.Driven by the abovementioned positives, investors interested in the industry would do well to keep stocks like Ryanair Holdings RYAAY, United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL on their radar.About the IndustryThe Zacks Airline industry players are engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Their operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers. Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy. For example, the aviation space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a beating. However, air travel demand is extremely rosy now. The focus on boosting cargo revenues is a positive too.Factors Relevant to the Industry's FortunesRosy Air Traffic Scenario: The stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from pandemic lows is a huge positive for the industry, which was one of the worst hit in the peak COVID-19 period. The removal of COVID-related restrictions is aiding air travel, which is now strong on the international front as well. Reflecting the recovery in air travel demand, overall global traffic was up 47.2% in the first half compared with the year-ago period, with double-digit increases on both the domestic and international fronts, per IATA.Story continuesPeople are again resorting to air travel as they resume their normal activities. Expecting the strong passenger volumes to continue, some airline companies like United Airlines have lifted their earnings per share view for the current year.Declining Fuel Costs: The southward movement of oil price bodes well for the bottom-line growth of industry participants. This is because fuel expenses are a significant input cost for the aviation space. Notably, oil price declined 6.6% in the April-June period of 2023. Per IATA, the average jet fuel cost is expected to be $98.5 per barrel in 2023 (earlier forecast was $111.9 per barrel).High Labor Costs: Increased operating costs are limiting bottom-line growth. With expenses on fuel moving south, costs will likely continue to be steep going forward due to escalated labor costs. Moreover, as U.S. airlines grapple with pilot shortage, the bargaining power of this labor group has increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked in the space. This is resulting in a spike in labor costs. American Airlines recently lifted its forecast for third-quarter non-fuel unit costs due to the four-year pay-related deal with pilots.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Airline industry is a 28-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #74, which places it in the top 29% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate for 2023 has moved up 27.3% since March 2023.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to add or retain in your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 But Outperforms SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry has gained 5.8% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composite’s rise of 6%.

(NASDAQ:ORLY) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.31bUS$2.52bUS$2.56bUS$2.72bUS$2.83bUS$2.93bUS$3.02bUS$3.10bUS$3.18bUS$3.26bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.12%Est @ 3.53%Est @ 3.11%Est @ 2.82%Est @ 2.62%Est @ 2.48% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$19bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.3b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.2%) = US$64bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$64b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$32bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$51b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$935, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at O'Reilly Automotive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.036. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for O'Reilly AutomotiveStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PepsiCoIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Robert Pohlad, sold US$13m worth of shares at a price of US$174 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$179, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 6.6% of Robert Pohlad's holding.Insiders in PepsiCo didn't buy any shares in the last year.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of PepsiCoI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. PepsiCo insiders own about US$329m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About PepsiCo Insiders?The fact that there have been no PepsiCo insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the PepsiCo insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for PepsiCo you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The company says it will list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker ""CART."" Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma breaks down the filing, noting that PepsiCo (PEP) is a large investor, planning to buy $175 million in convertible preferred stock.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: All right, we've got some company news here. Grocery delivery app Instacart filing to go public. The latest sign, the IPO market is starting to thaw. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma is here with the details. Brooke?BROOKE DIPALMA: Good afternoon, Diane. I mean, this is pretty exciting.DIANE KING HALL: It is.BROOKE DIPALMA: The IPO market seems to be making a comeback here. Instacart, the latest company to file its plans to go public on the NASDAQ under the symbol C-A-R-T, cart. Taking a closer look at the numbers, the company began generating profit at the end of 2022 after-- 2022 is right-- after being unprofitable in 2020 and 2021.The company said that was driven by diversified revenue streams including growth in their ad business. Today, the company has more than 5,500 brands using Instacart ads. That includes up and coming names like the prebiotic soda Poppi as well as Jennifer Garner's business Once Upon a Farm both highlighted in the S-1 filing.Another interesting part of the S-1 filing here is that PepsiCo plans to buy $175 million in convertible preferred stock. The company, however, did not disclose the total price and size of the IPO. But we do know that back in 2022, Instacart did, in fact, cut its valuation three times to a reported $13 billion.Now, the CEO said that they're focused on the long-term vision to power the future of grocery through technology-- technology that is. And when you think about the scope of Instacart, it is the biggest US online grocery delivery company. They have 7.7 million monthly active orderers who spend approximately $317 a month on average.Story continuesThey also have more than 1,400 national, regional, and local retailers that use Instacart. In addition to that, this company really came to consumers and Wall Street and Main Street's mind during the pandemic when momentum certainly picked up. We saw gross transactions jumped 300% between 2019 and 2020. But it's now getting more steady.From 2020 to 2021, gross transaction value jumped 20% that then decreased the following year. But something worth noting here is that while orders increased in 2021 and 2022, they did remain consistent from both 2022 to 2023. And so that consistency is interesting there after such a large ramp up during the pandemic.But for some of its in-store partners, they highlighted regional retailers like Publix and Wegmans. They did say that what they see with users on Instacart is that they are ordering more than in-store. And so lots more to come on Instacart potentially going public or filing to go public that is as it makes its public debut. And we'll be watching all of it.DIANE KING HALL: All right, Brooke DiPalma. The latest in the Instacart and the IPO craze. Well, not craze yet but coming back out of the woods.BROOKE DIPALMA: What we saw with Kava, I mean--DIANE KING HALL: Yes.BROOKE DIPALMA: --they were valued at $4.8 billion. So this really could be the rumbling of a comeback in the market.DIANE KING HALL: That's right. There we go. Brooke DiPalma.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN, Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD, Novavax, Inc. NVAX, Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. APLS and Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc. FULC.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Biotech Stock Roundup: REGN, APLS, NVAX &amp; MoreIt was a busy week for the biotech sector, with quite a few important updates. Among these, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals was in the spotlight as it finally gained the FDA's nod for a higher dose of its lead drug Eylea.Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories:Updates from Regeneron: Shares of Regeneron gained after the FDA approved an 8mg dose of aflibercept injection for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy under the brand name Eylea HD. A 2 mg dose of aflibercept is already approved under the brand name Eylea for various ophthalmology indications. The approval by the regulatory body was based on the 48-week results of two studies, PULSAR and PHOTON, which compared Eylea HD to aflibercept injection at 2 mg. Data from these studies showed that Eylea HD demonstrated clinically equivalent vision gains to Eylea, which were maintained with fewer injections.Concurrently, the regulatory body approved pozelimab-bbfg for treating adult and pediatric patients one year of age and older with CHAPLE disease, also known as CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy. The candidate has been approved under the brand name Veopoz in the United States. Per Regeneron, Veopoz is the first and only treatment indicated specifically for CHAPLE, an ultra-rare hereditary disease that can cause potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms.Story continuesEarlier, the European Medicines Agency accepted for review the company's marketing authorization application (MAA) for pipeline candidate odronextamab. The MAA is seeking approval of the candidate to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma or R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who have progressed after at least two prior systemic therapies.Setback for Gilead: Gilead Sciences, Inc. suffers a setback in developing its oncology candidate, magrolimab. The FDA has placed a partial clinical hold on new patient starts in studies evaluating magrolimab to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the United States.As a result of the hold, screening and enrollment of new study participants under the U.S. investigational new drug application (IND 147229) and U.S. Expanded Access Program will be paused. Nevertheless, patients already enrolled in AML studies may continue to receive treatment and be monitored according to the current study protocol. The candidate is a potential first-in-class anti-CD47 immunotherapy and is being evaluated for several potential indications, including ongoing trials in solid tumors. Management stated that studies of magrolimab in solid tumors can continue without any impact from this hold.Earlier, the late-stage ENHANCE study on magrolimab in higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes was discontinued. The decision to suspend the ENHANCE study was based on a planned analysis that indicated futility in achieving the study's primary endpoints, which were focused on complete response and overall survival.Gilead currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Novavax Vaccine Updates: Novavax, Inc. announced that its updated protein-based XBB COVID vaccine candidate induced neutralizing antibody responses in neutralizing antibodies against emerging subvariants the EG.5.1 (also known as 'Eris') and XBB.1.16.6 in studies on small animals and non-human primate. XBB sublineage variants currently account for the majority of COVID cases in the United States and the European Union. The vaccine has been designed to target the XBB descendent lineage viruses. NVAX shares gained on the news.Novavax had earlier announced that it had initiated a filing with the FDA for its updated COVID-19 vaccine and intends to submit one in Europe in the coming weeks. Management stated that it is manufacturing the updated vaccine commercially and planning to launch it in the upcoming fall.Apellis Gains on Safety Update:  Shares of Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. soared after the company provided an update on injection kits and an update on the rare events of retinal vasculitis reported in real-world treatment with Syfovre (pegcetacoplan injection) for geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration. The drug was approved for these indications in February 2023.The company received reports of retinal vasculitis (or inflammation) following treatment with Syfovre (pegcetacoplan injection) in July.  The company examined these cases along with the American Society of Retina Specialists' Research and Safety in Therapeutics (ReST). These events occurred between seven and 13 days after the initial administration of the drug, with no specific lots implicated.Apellis partnered with ReST and has been closely monitoring and investigating the occurrences of retinal vasculitis.  The company updated the number of confirmed adverse events to eight (five occlusive and three non-occlusive). Two of these events followed injections in April, three in May and three in June. All these events occurred after the initial administration of Syfovre.During the comprehensive investigation into real-world safety events, Apellis discovered internal structural variation in 19-gauge x 1½ inch filter needles in some injection kits. These filter needles play a crucial role in withdrawing medication from vials during the preparation of injection procedures. As a precautionary measure, Apellis recommends healthcare practitioners to not use injection kits containing the 19-gauge filter needle and switch to kits equipped with the 18-gauge filter needle, which are already in distribution.Fulcrum Gains on Hold Removal: Shares of clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc. surged after the company announced that the FDA has lifted the clinical hold on the investigational new drug (IND) application seeking approval of FTX-6058 for the potential treatment of sickle-cell disease (SCD).The FDA placed the clinical hold on the IND in February 2023. The regulatory body noted preclinical data previously submitted in April, October and December 2022, and non-clinical and clinical evidence of hematological malignancies observed with other inhibitors of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Thereafter, Fulcrum suspended dosing in the phase Ib trial of FTX-6058 and worked diligently with the agency to resolve the hold. Fulcrum plans to resume enrollment for patients with SCD shortly.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has gained 1.53% in the past five trading sessions. Among the biotech giants, Moderna has gained 16.72% during the period. Over the past six months, shares of Moderna have plunged 22.73%.

Let’s take a closer look at each.NVIDIA NVIDIA unveiled an additional sizable $25 billion share buyback following its latest blowout quarter, undoubtedly to the likes of investors. The stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings estimate revisions hitting the tape across the board.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegarding the mentioned quarter, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 30% and posted a 20% revenue beat.Earnings improved 430% year-over-year, whereas revenue jumped 100% from the same period last year. Data Center revenue, which consists of AI chips, grew a remarkable 140% sequentially and 170% year-over-year, crushing expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVRDirectors of NVR recently authorized a $500 million share buyback on August 2nd.

The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesThe company’s growth profile is hard to ignore, further reflected by its Style Score of “B” for Growth. AMP’s earnings are forecasted to climb 20% in its current year on 10% higher revenues. Peeking ahead to FY24, expectations allude to a further 12% bump in earnings paired with 7% higher sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineA common way that companies boost shareholder value is through implementing share buybacks. In its simplest form, buybacks represent a company essentially re-investing in itself.In addition, it can provide a nice confidence boost for investors, as the buybacks indicate that the company is utilizing its excess cash and not just hoarding it.All three stocks above – NVIDIA NVDA, NVR NVR, and Ameriprise Financial AMP – have recently unveiled repurchase programs, attempting to maximize shareholder value.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GPS reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. However, the top line lagged the consensus mark and declined year over year.Results were hurt by uncertain macro and consumer environments, as well as the sale of the Gap China business. On the flip side, share gains at Old Navy and Gap brands, adjusted operating margin expansion, a reduction in the inventory, and a strong balance sheet acted as tailwinds.Shares of Gap rose 1.5% in the after-market session on Aug 24, following the second-quarter fiscal 2023 results. In the past three months, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 14.3% compared with the industry’s 9.7% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The company posted adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share in the fiscal second quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents. Adjusted earnings also significantly improved from the 8 cents reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.Net sales declined 8% year over year to $3,548 million and slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,597 million. This includes a currency headwind of 1 percentage point and the adverse impacts of 2 percentage points from the sale of Gap China. The company completed the sale of Gap China at the beginning of first-quarter fiscal 2023. Comparable sales (comps) fell 6% in the fiscal second quarter.Digital sales decreased 11% year over year, accounting for 33% of the total sales for the reported quarter.

QuoteBrand-Wise Sales &amp; CompsOld Navy: Net sales at Old Navy Global declined 6% year over year to $1,961 million due to continued softness in demand from lower-income consumers and weak active category trends. However, the company witnessed strength in women’s tops and woven bottoms, along with renewed trends in men’s and kids. Comps also declined 6% in the fiscal second quarter. Sales for Old Navy Global beat our model’s estimate of $1,918.9 million.Gap Global: For second-quarter fiscal 2023, net sales declined 14% year over year to $755 million due to unfavorable impacts of the sale of Gap China, the shutdown of Yeezy Gap and currency headwinds. Excluding these headwinds, sales for the brand were down 4% in the quarter. The company’s sales were aided by a strong women’s category, offset by strategic store closures in North America. Comps dipped 1% in the reported quarter. Sales for Gap Global lagged our model’s estimate of $849.8 million.Banana Republic: Net sales decreased 11% year over year to $480 million, whereas comps fell 8%. Despite market share gains, sales comparison for the quarter were impacted by last year’s outsized sales growth for the brand, owing to the shift in consumer preferences. Sales lagged our estimate of $480.6 million.Athleta: Net sales edged down 1% year over year to $341 million for the Athleta brand, whereas comps declined 7%. Segmental results were hurt by continued product acceptance challenges. However, the decline was partly negated by efforts undertaken to improve product presentation and creatives, and to uplift the brand’s performance. Net sales surpassed our estimate of $335.6 million. Story continuesMargins &amp; CostsThe gross margin of 37.6% expanded 310 basis points (bps) and 160 bps, respectively, from the prior-year period’s reported and adjusted gross margins. The improvement resulted from a 260-bps expansion in merchandise margins. The merchandise margin benefited from lower airfreight than last year and improved promotional activity, offset by inflationary cost headwinds.Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses declined 8% year over year. Adjusted SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, leveraged 10 basis points to 36.6%, owing to lower advertising expenses, payroll and technology investments resulting from cost-saving actions.The adjusted operating income was $119 million in the fiscal second quarter, excluding $13 million of restructuring costs, compared with the adjusted operating income of $65 million in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin expanded 170 bps to 3.4%, driven by an improved gross margin and adjusted SG&amp;A leverage.Other FinancialsGap ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,350 million, up from $780 million in the year-ago period. As of Jul 29, 2023, it had a total stockholders’ equity of $2,263 million and a long-term debt of $1,487 million.As of Jul 29, the company generated $528 million in cash from operating activities. Gap paid out a dividend of $56 million in the fiscal second quarter. GPS approved a dividend of 15 cents per share for the fiscal third quarter.As of Jul 29, the company’s capital expenditure was $199 million. For fiscal 2023, capital expenditure is expected to be $500-$525 million.Store UpdateAs of Jul 29, 2023, Gap had 3,456 stores in more than 40 countries, of which 2,592 were company-operated and 864 were franchise outlets.GuidanceDespite the tough macro and consumer environments, management expects continued margin expansion and improved cash flow. The company anticipates fiscal 2023 sales to decline in the mid-single digits compared with the low to mid-single-digit decline mentioned earlier. The company reported net sales of $15.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company expects sales for fiscal 2023 to include an impact of $300 million from the sale of Gap China and a positive effect of $150 million from the 53rd week.The gross margin for fiscal 2023 is likely to expand in fiscal 2023. The gross margin expansion is likely to result from a 200-bps leverage due to the lapping of elevated airfreight costs in the prior year and a 100-bps margin gain from improved inventory position and promotional activity, offset by a 10-bps deleverage from inflationary costs. Additionally, the company expects the inflationary deleverage to turn into leverage in the second half of fiscal 2023, owing to gains from improved commodity costs and ocean freight rates. ROD, as a percentage of sales, is expected to deleverage 70 bps year over year.The company estimates adjusted operating expenses (SG&amp;A expenses) of $5.15 billion in fiscal 2023, owing to lower variable expenses relative to a lowered sales view.For third-quarter fiscal 2023, Gap expects a sales decline in the low-double digits, whereas it reported $4.04 billion last year. The decline can be attributed to the sale of Gap China, which is expected to impact net sales by $70 million in the fiscal third quarter.The company anticipates the fiscal third-quarter gross margin to be in line with the 38.7% reported last year. It envisions lower inflation and airfreight costs to be offset by 150 bps of ROD deleverage. It anticipates promotional activity to be mostly in line with that reported last year. Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses are likely to be $1.3 billion in the fiscal third quarter. The company expects year-over-year inventory to be down at the end of the fiscal third quarter, in line with year-to-date trends.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some better-ranked stocks that investors can consider, namely Urban Outfitters URBN, Boot Barn BOOT and American Eagle Outfitters AEO.Urban Outfitters, a lifestyle specialty retailer that offers fashion apparel and accessories, footwear, home décor and gift products, presently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company's new CEO Richard Dickson, former Mattel (MAT) executive, spoke about reigniting Gap's brands and the challenges ahead of the retail company. Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brad Smith break down the report.Video Transcript- Well, shares of Gap, we're watching them this morning. They're little changed, only up about 3/4 of 1% after reporting earnings after the bell on Thursday, Gap beating on earnings per share but reported a sales decline across all brands in the second quarter down 8% from the year prior to about 3 and 1/2 billion.In a call with analysts, CFO, Katrina O'Connell warned of a choppy consumer market, saying the company would be prudent in planning for the months ahead. The company anticipates a drop in revenue for the upcoming quarter with net sales decreasing in the low double digit percentage range.The company's new CEO, former Mattel executive Richard Dickson, he stepped into his new role just on Tuesday. He was on the call. He didn't have a lot of specifics to offer on the call but that makes sense considering he's only been in the job for about three days. But I think a lot of these numbers just show the challenge that is ahead of him. He talked about reigniting and reinvigorating Gap's brands, but how he's going to do that I think remains the question.- Yeah, and if there's anything that we can perhaps extrapolate from his time at Mattel and perhaps in next that are going to use the transitive property bring that over to Gap, you could see more collaborations. Of course, Gap had tried that. They tried that with Kanye West or Ye.That didn't necessarily work. You tried that with a few other kind of instances and for Gap as a whole, of course, you've got the different subsidiaries and Old Navy really has been the company that had put the team on its back for so long to the point where at one point, they were looking to spin off Old Navy into its own business.Story continuesAnd so now you look across some of these other brands. Banana Republic had a pretty good year to this point, at least as it seemed people were perhaps gearing up to get back into some of those in-person capacities, whether that be at work or at school. Athleta has also been interesting in tracking how they're competing with some of the other athleisure players.I believe we were just talking about it in our newsroom, and some of the fanfare was certainly permeating within there a few days ago but at the same time, you look across some of the results that came out in this quarter. Total company net sales, there was a foreign exchange headwind but including those factors, total company net sales would have been down by about 5%.Comp sales were down 6% in the quarter but they did say in spite of the sales declines, they're reporting that all four of their brands gained or maintained market share during the second quarter with particular strength in the women's category. So we'll see--- Yeah I thought that was interesting. And Katrina O'Connell, again, the CFO was also asked how things went, how things have gone over the past couple of months. Did she see any kind of improvement? And she did say there was some improvement on the conference call she talked about that, especially in gap and Old Navy. She said back to school is going OK also, so that's something that's perhaps a little bit more encouraging.And she also said she is watchful of the trend of student loan repayment, which she said would primarily affect customers of Old Navy. I think the question here is Old Navy in particular since it does target a lower income consumer, are those people just not buying? Because they're not trading-- what do you trade down to from an Old Navy, right?So I guess that is the question here. They're maybe not buying as much apparel in this environment. Something else that stood out to me from the call as Richard Dickson settles into his role, and by the way, he's not the only new person at the company. Remember, Athleta has a new head, a former executive from Alo, A-L-O, Alo.- A-L-O- Alo Yoga. Alo. Thank you, I always get that wrong. Chris Blakeslee is the new guy coming in there, but Dixon sort of emphasizing the size and scope of Gap. I mean, it's still a huge company. They have 90,000 employees at the company and they sell through $900 million units a year. So $900 million pieces of clothing or whatever it is that they're apparel and pieces that they're selling.- And it will be interesting to see what he does on the storefront side too. The company ended the quarter with 3456 store locations, you think about the changeover.- They've been shrinking it.- Yeah, they have. And you think about the annexation that this company has had to the mall and the prominence of the mall for the past 15, 20 years, if not more, and how many of us, growing up, had been able to walk into a Gap or a Banana Republic or one of their owned entities or an Old Navy within a mall experience.But now, that foot traffic is changing elsewhere and there is more of a mixed shift to go directly online for a lot of consumers at least to initiate their search or to get inspiration if some of those stores, you see that continue to shrink, where they might reposition other stores and perhaps even shrink sum of the square footage that they operate to, which is something that we've heard over the course of this earnings season even as we were listening to some of the results from company in Macy's as well, how they're looking for many of these mall annexed or mall known type of pillars for many years where they're going to look to some of those smaller locations to really make sure that they're still having that consumer touch point.Get in, feel the clothes, put them on, try it on, whatever, see if you like it, walk out with it, great. If not, then you can have another type of realm where you spend more into that digital and that direct to consumer as well.]"

There’s no denying that Richard was destined for this role at this moment. His experience as a transformational brand builder makes him a perfect fit for this great company. He is uniquely qualified to lead and carry out the transformative work already underway and more importantly, he is the right leader for tomorrow, defining the future of Gap Inc.

But what energizes him most is building a new legacy for our renowned portfolio of brands, one that matters to our customers, employees and shareholders.Story continuesAnd before I hand off, I want to say thank you to our entire Gap Inc. team for their commitment to the success of this company and their tenacity and care for our brands, for embracing operational rigor and regaining the product and customer obsession with an eye on modernizing the way we work, all of which becomes a strong foundation for what’s ahead under Richard’s leadership. I have great belief that Richard and this team will define a very bright future for this company. So, with that, I want to welcome Richard Dickson, the new CEO of Gap Inc. Richard?Richard Dickson: Well, good afternoon. This is my third official day as CEO of Gap Inc. So first, let me begin by thanking Bobby, the Board and the entire Gap Inc. organization for the opportunity to lead this incredible company. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Now many have asked me, why Gap Inc. and why now? So, let me start by saying that I have admired Gap Inc. and its brands Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta for decades as a customer, a brand builder, and most recently, as a Board member. Those of you who know a bit about my career know that I’ve always been drawn to companies and brands with storied legacies and powerful purposes. And in apparel, there’s no equal to Gap Inc.When Don and Doris Fisher opened the very first Gap store in San Francisco in 1969, little did they know, that they had tapped into the zeitgeist in a way that would democratize and define American style. Suddenly, great clothes were accessible, stores were experiential, self-expression could be an everyday pursuit, open to all. Talk about a game changer, Gap did that. Creating an opportunity from the currents of culture has been a hallmark of Gap Inc. for more than 5 decades. Over the years, our brands made jeans, khakis, kidswear, suits, yoga pants, you name it, into massive trends through great design, great marketing and an all-out obsession with our customer. Fast forward to today. The apparel and retail landscape has changed dramatically, evolving at an even quicker pace now it requires that great brands run at the speed of culture to maintain relevance.What has not changed is the customer’s desire for fashion they can make their own. We will take that one step further, making what we do, what we stand for, and what we sell, relevant. As anyone in this industry will tell you, clothing is a rational need, while fashion is an emotional want. Our brands will balance both. Going forward, I’m confident that we have the scale, talent, and determination to spark huge, defining trends again. Think about it, Gap Inc. is the largest specialty apparel company in America. An empowered community of more than ninety thousand people who apply their talents to Gap Inc. and our brands producing about nine hundred million units a year. Our brands draw 600 million visits to stores, and 1.4 billion to our sites online each year, making Gap Inc.the #2 player in US apparel ecommerce. These customers, across multiple generations, turn to Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta to help them step out everywhere from schools and studios to offices and date nights. So, our brands matter. But they can matter even more. In my previous role in toys and entertainment, we always strived to make consumers fans and to grow those fandoms. And I want to apply that approach to our portfolio of brands. A virtuous cycle where our products and experiences motivate belief and loyalty that fans then badge and amplify in culture, growing the fandom, validating, and inspiring us to even greater creativity and monetization. It works because everyone wins. Gap Inc. brands already have incredible fans. Our job now will be to excite and delight them even more, growing their numbers and the value of our brands.The comprehensive transformation effort that Bobby initiated has been an important step in that direction, streamlining operations so that we can focus on growth-driving initiatives. And Katrina will take you through that progress, in addition to the quarterly performance, in detail. But before she does, I want to acknowledge that restructuring is challenging. And that change of this magnitude doesn’t come fast. Transformation is difficult. Still, our people, at every level of the organization, have stepped up, made tough calls, and championed the progress we’ve made so far. And we’re going to keep going. As we continue to focus on strengthening our financial footing, we’re now going to build on that progress, accelerating our efforts to drive profitable growth by unlocking the value in our brands.This time, we’ll do it differently with a clear focus on brand revitalization, redefining our brands meaning to consumers, focusing on creativity designing for relevance as a pursuit rather than a goal, building to quality and leveraging our remarkable legacy to shape an exciting new future. That’s my passion. It’s why I’m here and why I’m here now. And I know that our teams are just as passionate and committed to making it happen. In the quarters to come, I’ll share specific priorities and plans. What I can tell you today is that I’m intent on reigniting a creative culture at Gap Inc. that is a magnet for the industry’s best talent, including the great creative talent we already have, recommitting each of our brands to a distinctive brand purpose that aligns with customer values and sets them apart, reorienting our brands around both the art and science of design-centric thinking informed by consumer insights in an absolute obsession with our customer, reengaging in the cultural conversation with hyper-relevant products and ideas that inspire constructive dialogues and rethinking how our brands show up in store and online with customer experiences that excite and delight.Most of all, mattering to our people, our investors, our communities, and the world. In the coming weeks, I look forward to spending time in every part of the organization. Our headquarters offices, stores, customer support centers, DCs, and with partners in key regions of the US, and globally. Meeting the people behind our brands, the customers who shop us, and you, our shareholders. Listening, learning, experiencing it all first-hand in order to get grounded and even more defined about where we’re going. I’ll wrap up by saying that my start date was deliberate. Just as August 22, 1969, was the milestone that created this remarkable company, I want August 22, 2023, to mark the start of an exciting new chapter for Gap Inc. One that celebrates our past as we pioneer an extraordinary future.Thank you. And I’ll now hand-off the call to Katrina.Katrina O’Connell: Thank you, Richard. It has been a pleasure working with you in your role as a Board member over the past 9 months, and I am thrilled to partner with you in your new role as CEO. Let me start with some reflections on our financial performance before I dive into more detail. Notably, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and improve cash flows, reducing inventory 29% year-over-year, generating over $300 million of free cash flow, further paying down our ABL balance, and ending the quarter with cash and equivalents of $1.4 billion, nearly twice as much as last year. Even in a choppy consumer market, each of our brands maintained or gained share during the quarter, fueled particularly by strength in our women’s business through great style and relevant fashion.We delivered net sales within our previously communicated guidance range despite a weak apparel environment. We substantially completed the organizational changes that we previewed earlier this year which we continue to expect will drive about $300 million in cost savings annually but more importantly will change how we work, allowing teams to be more consumer-centric. We continued to successfully recoup the excess air costs we incurred during the pandemic. That combined with improved unit sell-through rates driving AURs enabled meaningful gross margin expansion despite the inflationary cost headwinds we have faced. We believe the actions to improve our operations and shore up the foundation of Gap Inc. continue to position us well as we enter the second half of fiscal 2023 and beyond.While we are pleased with this progress, we are mindful of the mixed economic and consumer environment in which we are operating. With that backdrop, we continue to plan the business prudently. And the outlook we are providing today for both the third quarter and fiscal 2023 does contemplate the headwinds we continue to navigate in the second half of the year while also taking on new challenges like the resumption of student loan payments. Let me start now with our second quarter results. Net sales of $3.5 billion decreased 8% versus last year in the range of our expectations for second quarter sales to be down mid- to high single digits. Store sales decreased 7% from the prior year. Online sales decreased 11% versus last year and represented 33% of total net sales in the quarter.As a reminder, the sale of Gap China completed at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 had about a $60 million or 2-point negative impact to net sales growth. There was also a 1 point foreign exchange headwind. Excluding these factors, total company net sales would have been down about 5%. Comparable sales were down 6% in the quarter. In spite of the sales declines, we’re pleased to report that all 4 of our brands gained or maintained market share during the second quarter, with particular strength in women’s. We know that regardless of market conditions, strong brands, brands that matter, win. So we remain focused on the levers and opportunities in our control to deliver on behalf of our customers, employees and shareholders.Let me now provide some sales color and highlights by brand. Starting with Old Navy. Net sales in the second quarter were $1.96 billion. Both net sales and comparable sales declined 6% versus last year. We’re pleased that Old Navy again modestly gained share in the quarter despite increased softness in the active category as well as continued slower demand from the lower-income consumer. We believe that Old Navy remains well positioned given its value orientation in the marketplace. The Old Navy team has lined up great marketing, product and value to compete in the important back-to-school season. Turning to Gap brand. Gap brand total sales of $755 million were down 14% versus last year and comparable sales were down 1%. Excluding the negative impacts to sales of 7 points related to the sale of Gap China, 2 points due to the shutdown of Yeezy Gap and the estimated 1 point from foreign exchange, net sales were down 4% versus last year, predominantly driven by store closures in North America.Women’s was the standout segment in the quarter, outpacing the market as the brand’s reinvented icons are resonating with consumers. Gap continues to make great strides with exciting collaborations and partnerships as the brand executes against its strategy to reimagine its product icons in new and exciting ways. Earlier this month, Gap brand partnered with LoveShackFancy on a limited-edition, multi-category capsule for every generation. The collaboration merges Gap’s iconic styles with LoveShackFancy’s vintage-inspired florals and feminine silhouettes. This most recent collaboration is a prime example of how Gap’s strategy of partnering with relevant brands and individuals can create buzz and marketing for the brand, reaching new consumers and garnering more premium pricing.Turning to Banana Republic. Second quarter sales of $480 million declined 11% year-over-year. Comparable sales were down 8%. Revenue remains impacted in the short-term as the brand laps an outsized benefit last year driven by the dramatic shift in customer preferences. BR continues to make impressive strides in its evolution to a premium lifestyle brand. Fine fabrics, like linen, cashmere, and leather showed signs of strength in the quarter and the brand expects to maximize them in the back half of the year. Banana Republic’s transformation towards a more evolved lifestyle position is coming to life through an elevated fashion aesthetic and more full price selling. As we look to the future, we are excited to see the brand extend its vision and refined aesthetic to other addressable markets with BR Home, including the launch of premium bedding, rugs, pillows, and décor in March, and the upcoming debut of a broader home offering this fall.Athleta sales of $341 million declined 1% from the prior year. Comparable sales were down 7%, an improvement in trend from Q1. Sales in core performance bottoms, the critical backbone of Athleta’s assortment, accelerated throughout the quarter and outperformed total brand sales. Athleta’s positioning, empowering a community of active women and girls to reach their true potential through the Power of She is as relevant and impactful as ever. The work the team has been doing to improve product presentation, customer experience, and creative in the short term, optimizing online marketing, site merchandising, and resetting store floors in key markets emphasizes the performance DNA that Athleta is known for. We are excited to welcome Chris Blakeslee to the team.As a proven leader in driving growth and innovation in the active apparel and wellness sector, most recently at Alo Yoga, we look forward to the work he and the team will drive to bring the Athleta brand to its full potential over the long-term. Now to gross margin in the quarter. Gross margin was 37.6%, an increase of 310 basis points versus last year’s reported gross margin. Compared to last year’s adjusted rate, gross margin expanded 160 basis points due to merchandise margin expansion of approximately 260 basis points, which was slightly ahead of our expectations, partially offset by ROD deleverage of 100 basis points. Drivers of the margin rate expansion were as follows: approximately 200 basis points of leverage as we lapped last year’s elevated air freight and drove our normalized air expense down; approximately 200 basis points of leverage driven primarily from improved promotional activity relative to last year; approximately 140 basis points of deleverage related to inflationary cost headwinds, which was better than our prior expectations of approximately 200 basis points as we realized improved ocean freight rates; and ROD was flat on a nominal basis compared to last year but deleveraged 100 basis points due to the lower sales volume.Now let me turn to SG&amp;A. Reported SG&amp;A in the second quarter was $1.2 billion and included $13 million in restructuring charges related to our headcount actions. On an adjusted basis, second quarter SG&amp;A declined 8% and leveraged 10 basis points versus last year, driven mainly by lower advertising expense, payroll and technology investments. Reported operating income was $106 million. Adjusted operating income, which excludes restructuring charges, was $119 million in the second quarter. Adjusted operating margin improved 170 basis points from last year to 3.4% in the quarter, driven by the 160 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and 10 basis points of adjusted SG&amp;A leverage. During the second quarter, we recorded a benefit to both tax and net interest as a result of a transfer pricing settlement related to our sourcing activities.Reported EPS was $0.32, adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, was $0.34. Share count ended at 369 million. Turning to balance sheet and cash flow, starting with inventory. Ending inventories declined 29% in second quarter versus last year. This includes a 9 percentage point decline related to in-transit as we lap the prior year supply chain challenges and 6 points of decline related to releasing the majority of our pack and hold inventory balance. The remaining 14-point decline was driven by more efficient inventory management. As you know, we made significant progress on reducing inventories as we exited fiscal 2022. We remain focused in fiscal 2023 on moderating buys and utilizing our responsive levers. As a result, we are planning for year-over-year inventory to be down generally in line with year-to-date trends at the end of third quarter.Quarter-end cash and equivalents were $1.4 billion, an increase of 91% from the prior year. Year-to-date net cash from operating activities was $528 million, driven primarily by lower inventory levels. Capital expenditures were $199 million. We are pleased to have generated free cash flow of $329 million year-to-date. As we told you last quarter, we expect to be positioned to pay down the $350 million draw on our asset-backed line of credit this year. During the quarter, we paid down $200 million and intend to pay down the remaining $150 million balance by the end of the year. We remain committed to delivering an attractive quarterly dividend as a core component of total shareholder returns. During the quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.15 per share.And on August 16, our Board approved maintaining that $0.15 dividend for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Now turning to our outlook. We are all well aware of the mixed economic data and uncertain consumer trends in the marketplace, including the new dynamic regarding student loan repayments beginning in the third quarter. As a result, we continue to be prudent in our approach to planning in light of what remains an uncertain macro environment and choppy consumer backdrop. We now anticipate fiscal 2023 net sales inclusive of the 53rd week to be down generally in the mid-single-digit range compared to $15.6 billion in net sales last year and similar to our first half 2023 sales performance. The extra week is estimated to add approximately $150 million to fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 net sales.Specific to Q3 sales, we’re encouraged by trend improvements as we exit second quarter and into August. However, we remain mindful of two important dynamics for the quarter: First, we are lapping tougher sales comparisons from last year; and second, as mentioned, we remain measured in our outlook. With these dynamics in mind, we are estimating third quarter net sales to be down in the low double-digit range compared to the $4.04 billion in net sales last year. Turning to gross margin. Starting with the full year compared to the 35% adjusted gross margin in fiscal 2022, gross margin expansion in fiscal 2023 is expected to be driven by the following factors: an estimated 200 basis points of leverage as we lap last year’s elevated air freight and continued to drive down normalized air expense; at least 100 basis points of margin benefit as a result of our better inventory position and expected improved promotional activity compared to last year; approximately 10 basis points of inflationary cost deleverage versus last year.As we look to the second half, we expect the inflationary deleverage in the first half of the year will shift to leverage in the back half as we benefit from both improved commodity costs and ocean freight rates; and ROD as a percentage of sales is now planned to deleverage roughly 70 basis points compared to last year. For the third quarter, we expect gross margin to be generally in line with last year’s adjusted gross margin of 38.7%. We anticipate lower inflation and air costs slightly below normalized levels are expected to offset approximately 150 basis points of ROD deleverage, and we expect that promotional activity will be largely in line with last year. Turning to SG&amp;A. We now expect fiscal 2023 SG&amp;A of approximately $5.15 billion, below our prior outlook of $5.2 billion, primarily driven by variable expense flow through on our narrow to fiscal 2023 sales.SG&amp;A in the third quarter is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $500 million to $525 million for the year. In closing, we were pleased to drive meaningful margin expansion and strong cash flow generation in the quarter and remain focused on delivering our fiscal 2023 outlook despite what continues to be a choppy consumer environment. I am looking forward to working with Richard and the team as we unlock the value of our important and iconic brands and position Gap Inc. back on its path towards sustainable, profitable growth and delivering value for our shareholders over the long term. With that, we’ll open up the call for questions. Operator?See also 21 Most Innovative Countries in the World and 11 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks to Buy.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.Matthew Boss : Great. So maybe a two-part question. Richard, could you elaborate on the encouraging signs of progress that you see across the organization and maybe just as we think about opportunity for your concepts to take market share over time. And then Katrina, maybe just any way to elaborate on trends that you saw progress as the second quarter move forward? And maybe what you’re seeing today in terms of consumer behavior in August and into back-to-school?Richard Dickson: Well, first off, thank you, Matthew, for the question. And I’ll start with saying again how excited I am to be here on my third day. What I can tell you in the context of where we are, first and foremost, is that these brands are incredible assets, Gap, Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta, these are truly some of the most iconic brands in the fashion industry. We serve such a broad-based consumer, which is such a strength as well, generations and backgrounds. We’ve got incredible story legacies, 54-year-old history. We created massive trends. When I look at the strength across the portfolio, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we’re the #1 specialty apparel company in America, the scale that we operate with 600 million store visits, 1.4 billion online visits.The scaled operations we have from our DC network and logistics, our vendor partnerships, which can provide us incredible favorable rates and service, our production, we produced over 900 million units annually, the stats and strength of the fundamentals of this business are pretty incredible. Clearly, the transformation work that the team has done has put us on incredibly better financial footing. As Katrina mentioned, again, $1.4 billion in cash on hand in the balance sheet, $300 million of cash flow, 30% less inventory. These are metrics that matter and ultimately, metrics that are incredibly encouraging in the context of our ability to build upon it and continue it and go forward. As I also mentioned, part 2 to the question in terms of where are the opportunities.These are brands that truly matter. Now as I also said, they can matter more. And how to do that? I talked about reigniting the creative culture at Gap. We have extraordinary talent here. We are going to not only encourage the great talent to be unlocked in new and innovative ways, but we’re also going to become a magnet for the industry’s best talent. We are going to work very specifically with intent on creating distinctive brand purposes and ultimately really driving a consumer proposition that sets us apart from the competition and really leveraging, if you will, the art and science of this business, informed by consumer insights, but ultimately really obsessing over the consumer. There’s a lot of work ahead, but I’m incredibly encouraged with 3 days in around what we can offer and where we’re going ahead.And obviously, in the days ahead, quarters ahead as well, we’ll get more details and look forward to sharing that with you.Katrina O’Connell : Thanks, Richard, and Matthew. I think on your other part of your question, we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter in where in July, we definitely saw more improvement than we had seen sort of in May and June. I think that mirrored a lot of what apparel showed overall and we’ve seen that improvement continue into August, which we’re encouraged by. Overall, what we’re seeing is that the women’s business, particularly at Gap and Old Navy has shown momentum shift and kids and baby as we’re in the important back-to-school period has also started off fairly well. So all of that is encouraging to see. And then as I said in my prepared remarks, we’re mindful, though, of the fact that we’ve seen the consumer still be pressured, especially at the low income range.And we’re watchful of what I think is widely reported as the student loan repayment coming in the end of the quarter, which does primarily impact our Old Navy consumer.Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.Paul Lejuez : Richard, you’ve been on the Board, so obviously in touch with what’s been going on operationally to some extent. So I’m curious what you think might be the lowest hanging fruit as you think about each of the brands. Also curious, big organization, you talked about scale. Profitability doesn’t quite match the efficiencies you would expect with such scale. So I’m curious what you think are the biggest inefficiencies of the company.Richard Dickson: Yes. Thanks, Paul. Look, broadly speaking, it’s about really reigniting Gap Inc.’s culture to really empower creativity in my experience on the Board and certainly on the ground for 3 days running fast. Our teams are incredibly creative and they’re all in on this. They’re differentiating and strengthening our brands, being design-centric, being customer-obsessed and ultimately being culturally relevant. These are not necessarily new phrases and their common language, but these are the areas that we need to work upon and reignite and ultimately, really think about how our brands show up in-store, online with consumer experiences that really excite and attract drive demand and all of the variables that go into kind of balancing wants and needs that ultimately is kind of where fashion lies.When I think about our brands in the context of opportunity, brands that have the kind of strength that we do, brands that matter can be monetized. We need to make these brands matter more. And ultimately, that is going to be the pursuit. When I look at the strengths of the business, it is incredibly encouraging. That being said, we have work to do. We’ve started this transformation work under Bobby’s leadership, and the team has worked tirelessly to make extraordinary progress. But we will continue not only the transformation that we’ve begun, but we will start to build upon it and really unlock the value of these brands. We can all agree that there is greater value in the portfolio that is showing up in the stock today. And with the consistent performance that we expect, we’re going to get rewarded for that.And ultimately, that’s going to start with really driving demand, exciting our consumers and mattering more. And we’ll be back very shortly to share how we’re going to reveal all of that and continue moving forward.Paul Lejuez : Okay. Can you just talk about what changed in your gross margin assumption for the back half of the year, which pieces moved as a result of what you’ve seen first half to date and what you’re seeing thus far in the third quarter?Katrina O’Connell : Yes, absolutely, Paul. So in second quarter, overall, the gross margin in total came in very close to, I think, the words we had used to get you guys close to the margin we just delivered. There was a little bit of a shift between the inflationary pressure, which was better, came in at about 140 basis points of headwind. We had thought it would be closer to 200. And that was really because we saw rates in the freight area get better through some negotiations we just finished with some of our big suppliers. And where we saw the margin get a little worse within ROD where we deleveraged more since we came in at the lower end of our sales range in the quarter. So that dynamic plays through to the year where, again, the overall guide on the full year margin is basically intact.Air is still about 200 basis points of benefit, but we now see less impact from inflation, so only 10 basis points versus we had prior said 50 basis points of headwind and then the offset there is ROD where we now expect 70 basis points of deleverage, whereas we had said somewhere between zero and 50. So it’s really this inflationary benefit offset by ROD deleverage, but overall, the nominal guide is very similar.Paul Lejuez : And a promotional level is different than what you expected?Katrina O’Connell : We came in very close in the second quarter to what we expected on promotions. And overall, we’re holding the full year to about 100 basis points of overall leverage coming out of that promotional guide. And for the third quarter, what we said is we expect promotions to be about flat. So we’ll see. Obviously, we came in with inventories down 29%. And markdown inventory well under control. And the teams are excited to have chase capability back after the supply disruption that we experienced for so long. So we’ll aspire to do better. But right now, that’s what’s embedded in the guide.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.Alex Straton: Katrina, maybe this is just for you. It looks like Old Navy has yet to inflect though we are seeing some other value-oriented businesses, pulling that off, it seems in this quarter. So can you talk to you about what’s going on there? Are you seeing any green shoots outside of women? I feel like we’ve had that maybe for a couple of quarters now? And then how you think about the time line to improvement.Katrina O’Connell : Yes, it’s a great question, Alex. So when I look at what’s been happening at Old Navy, I think what’s been consistent is what we’ve been calling out, which is they do have a low income consumer that remains pressured. And so that dynamic hasn’t necessarily changed. When I look at what happened in Q2, though, lapping last year’s significant clearance of active product, in particular, really weighed on the performance. If you remember last year in Old Navy, we were in the process of really rightsizing the assortment away from cozy-casual. We had a lot of the sizing issues. So lapping that has really weighed on the revenue side of things. As we move into the second half, we are seeing the active business improve modestly.Women’s is getting better and kids is looking better as well. So we’ll see where that all lands us. But yes, we are seeing green shoots at Old Navy. I think all of those categories we aspire to have getting better. Again, the consumer pressure is most acute at Old Navy, and that’s the piece that I think we all remain cautious on is whether it’s the low income consumer starting to get real wage pressure from inflation or whether it’s the new student loan dynamic, we’ll see how that plays out for Old Navy.Operator: Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.Lorraine Hutchinson : Katrina, as you think about the mid-single-digit decline in sales guidance for the year, it does imply a nice improvement in fourth quarter, can you just talk about how you’ve been thinking about that improvement? What drives it outside of the 53rd week, of course, and how you’re getting comfortable with that level of improvement from here?Katrina O’Connell : Yes. So Lorraine, you’re correct that the fourth quarter does have some benefit from the 53rd week. But in addition to that, I know we’re all tired of looking back at 2019, but I just sort of look at the run rate in the business from the first half to the back half versus 2019. And the quarters Q3 and Q4 are very similar to what we just sort of went through. So I think there’s a lot of quarterly variation that we have seen over the last couple of years. Fourth quarter when you look back to 2019, looks more similar to history.Operator: Our next question comes from Jonna Kim with TD Cowen.Jonna Kim : Just a question on Athleta, sort of how you’re thinking about turning around the brand and getting the brand back from growth over time and just be competitive in the market?Katrina O’Connell : Yes, I’ll take that. And I mean, Richard, of course, I welcome your view as well, but maybe I’ll start, and then you can say a little bit more. As I said in my prepared remarks, we feel really good about Athleta’s positioning in the marketplace. The power sheet positioning is incredibly strong. And we feel like we have a lot of white space in that brand to win. We knew we had some near-term product execution issues, which the team, as I said, has been heads down working on. For fall, there’s not a lot of change to the product that the teams have been able to do, but they’ve been remerchandising the stores and the site and hopefully, if you’re a consumer, you see that it looks much more in line with the brand aesthetic.And then we are excited to welcome a few new players to the team, whether it’s Chris or Julia, who we think will also bring their experience to bear on the brand starting in fourth quarter and then really into next year. So we’re very excited about Athleta’s potential long term, and we know we’re just sort of going to get through the next quarter or two as we make the changes we can to the assortment we have. But Richard, I’ll let you add if there’s something else.Richard Dickson: Yes. Thanks, Katrina. As a member of the Board, I had a chance to get to know Chris and help select him for this role. He’s an exceptional talent, broad-based experience across the apparel retail and wholesale industries holding roles across multiple functions. As the recent President of Alo Yoga, he was really able to successfully and quickly grow that brand, nearly doubling its year-over-year growth and with extraordinary expertise in performance apparel. So as Katrina called out, we couldn’t be more enthusiastic about the team that Chris is leading and their recent efforts and we’re really looking forward to the accelerated progress that we intend on making with this brand.Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.Bob Drbul : Richard, welcome. I guess, Richard, for you, when you look at the -- you talked about Chris, but when you look at the team that you have in place having been on the Board is -- I think you understand their vision. Should we assume there are no further management changes necessary at a very senior level as you look at the portfolio?Richard Dickson: Yes. Thanks, Bob, for the question. I’ve been on the board since last year when much of the work began taking root. And I feel I could really hit the ground running. That said, it’s early. I’m focused on listening and learning. We really do have a very strong team. I only see it getting stronger. So in the context of, let’s call it, more tenured and now obviously 3 days in, from what I feel and see in the context of being on the ground, I’m very encouraged. The work that the team has done around the transformation has really toiled the soil, if you will, in the context of my entrance and really feel like the baton being handed is strong. So with that said, we’ll share a lot more in the coming quarters around where we’re headed, how we’re going to get there, and ultimately, much more detail associated with it, but early days, I’m very encouraged.Bob Drbul : Great. And Katrina, if I could just sneak a second one in for you. In terms -- you made some progress on the SG&amp;A. I know there’s been some discussion around potential for further cuts. Is there any sort of further idea on additional opportunities as you look at the SG&amp;A line going forward?Katrina O’Connell : Yes. It’s a good question, Bob. I mean, when we look at the work we’ve done, we’ve impacted about $550 million of cost in the business, whether it’s the actions we took early last fall, that have helped offset some of the inflationary pressure this year or whether it’s the overhead actions we just took that we think will generate $300 million cost. So I think you’ve heard both Bobby and Richard say that we’re happy with a lot of this work we’ve done to set the foundation. The remaining SG&amp;A work, I think, is to be seen. A lot of it is on some of the demand-generating investments we’ve made, marketing and technology where I think Richard and I will really partner on assessing whether we think those are adding the value that we think they need to add or whether there are some refinements we can make there.And that’s the next leg of the journey for us to see how we would if we would really moderate those in the next coming quarters. So more to come, but those are the areas, I think, consistent with what we’ve been saying that we would look at.Operator: Our next question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.Corey Tarlowe : You mentioned in your prepared remarks about how you’re rethinking about how the brands show up in-stores and online. So just be curious to kind of get your thoughts. And again, having been on the Board since November, your thoughts around kind of the store fleet and how to profitably leverage the store fleet to drive further sales ahead? And then just – Katrina, just wanted to get your thoughts around -- apologies if I missed it on promotions in the second half of this year?Richard Dickson: Thanks, Corey. There’s a lot in my opening remarks, and we can double-click on many of them. But in the context of the areas that I see the most opportunities, it’s specific to really working on this distinctive brand purpose that aligns with our customer values and really sets them apart. As I talk about the brands and their legacies, I really -- these are brands that matter. And when you have brands that matter, they could be monetized. That being said, you have to make these brands matter more that has to have great product, great marketing, great execution, and we really need to understand and be obsessed with our customer. I think that we have elements of it, but where we’re going to really work very, very diligently on is creating meaningful differences in the context of our brands and making these brands matter more.When you look at our stores, they need to reflect, if you will, the right narrative in the context of product statements that we believe are heroic, products that we believe will matter to our consumers, the right balance between basics and fashion and an experience where details really come across to create an experience that consumers will talk about, want to return to and ultimately find, if you will, the value and quality and product experiences that are required today for brands that win. And that’s what you’re going to see us work much more diligently on as transformations go, these things take time. But we will start to test and roll and really learn essentially what works and what doesn’t in a more accelerated way so that we could do more of what works and do less of what doesn’t, lots more to come with lots more examples, and we’ll share those as they evolve.Katrina O’Connell : Yes. It’s great, Richard. And I think, Corey, to answer your second question, we did see successful expansion of gross margin with lower promotional levels in the second quarter. So we saw about 200 basis points of margin expansion coming from lower discounting in the second quarter. Right now, in our outlook, we have basically a flat level of promotional activity in Q3. So as we talked about, we’ll aspire to do better with the lower inventory levels and chase that we have but we remain cautious on the consumer. And so we definitely want to make sure that we’re offering enough value to the consumer heading into the third quarter. So we’ll see where that lands.Operator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Adrienne Yih: Great. Richard, this is sort of more philosophical question given you’ve only been there 3 days -- a year and then 3 days. So your tenure at Mattel was sort of similar in concept sort of reinvigorate sort of the core brands, restore growth and restore the position sort of as an industry leader. So I guess my question is, oftentimes, when you have a company that’s been struggling, the creative team and all those assets get very safe, right? So they become very risk averse. And I’m just wondering, how do you create a culture of greater risk-taking and innovation such that, that creativity can kind of come to the forefront?Richard Dickson: It’s a great question. There are a lot of parallels with my experience at Mattel and Gap Inc.’s business across many levels. And I’m here to architect and orchestrate ultimately to lead. And the parallel construction of where Mattel was and where Gap is, is very familiar. Great assets great talent, a moment where, to some extent, a lot of self-inflicted challenges, some within our control and some ultimately impacting our business and our industry. And ultimately, a phase that we are going to go through, which is really about unlocking the value of our brands through reigniting a creative culture, the balance of fundamental and/or fiscal responsibility and operational rigor. While you are driving a design-centric and creative culture is the art and science of the leadership that you need to have in this business.It is a very familiar language. It’s actually a very familiar model. And ultimately, you’ve got to be able to take swings that are calculated, test, roll, learn and scale and accelerate very, very quickly. That is a muscle that we will begin to exercise and strengthen with the experience that I bring in the context of that type of leadership, I believe that that’s going to add value very, very quickly. This is an organization that is really excited to unlock and reignite, if you will, creativity. And so I feel incredibly fortunate to be inheriting a business that, from a transformational perspective, has come through, if you will, a very heavy lift and is now delivering, if you will, a fertile ground for a design-led culture, creativity that ultimately will show up for consumers and the ability for us to make brands that matter, matter more.Adrienne Yih: That’s super helpful. Katrina, one quick one -- sorry, did you talk about shrink? When do you take your physicals? I think it’s midyear, but I may be wrong. And is there anything to call out there of note?Katrina O’Connell : Yes. There’s nothing notable to call out from us on shrink. We do full counts once a year in the early part of the year, first quarter. We do partials in the second half of the year. And as of now, our shrink remains below pre-pandemic levels, and there’s really nothing to call out. So shrink is so far for us not anything of note.Operator: Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group.Dana Telsey : Welcome, Richard. Just following, Richard, in terms of some of the thoughts to what you’ve done in the past. I’ve read some of the articles about how you put together the thoughts on brand relevance of 4 points. Why do we exist design-led innovation, culturally relevant and execute with excellence. How do you look at those initiatives or those topics in comparison to Gap and your initial thoughts on reinventing and rearchitecting the business model in any way. And then, Katrina, I just wanted to follow up on, as you think about 2024 and planning, how are you thinking about inventories for the back half of the year and into next year?Richard Dickson: Thank you for the study of my background and playbook at Mattel. My experience in turning brands around accelerating performance, it goes beyond the development of a playbook, but really rallying teams to deliver on a plan, ensuring operational rigor and enabling a culture to execute with excellence. And the context of that methodology, when you look at Gap brands, these are beloved brands. They have a real connection with consumers, and we need to reignite that connection. I’m passionate about motivating teams to uncover what made a brand or a company iconic and special in the first place and then working together to reinvigorate them to new relevance. So the familiarities in the context of the work and legacy brands revitalization methodologies are familiar and similar.That being said, the playbook that we will reveal that will be the strength and the consideration set to reignite the Gap portfolio will be one that we’ve collectively work on as a team as I listen, learn, spend time with our stores, our headquarters, DC, partners and really start to understand ultimately what will be the Gap playbook that will deliver ultimately to our consumers, our people and our shareholders, and we’ll be back shortly to be able to share all of that.Katrina O’Connell : And then, Dana, on inventory, we do expect that third quarter ending inventory will be very similar to the first half trends. And overall, more to come as we head into next year, but we expect to be running more and more on leaner inventory with receipts left opened so that we can be more responsive to consumer demand closer in. And a lot of the transformational activity that we’re working on is not only just reinstating the responsive levers that we’ve had, but working closer with our vendor base to make sure that we have the right materials, the right logic with our vendors to be closer to the consumer. So all of that helps us have leaner inventories and be more dynamic. So more to come on what those levels are going forward.Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Roach : I wanted to follow up on Old Navy. Can you elaborate on the competitive backdrop that you’re seeing in the business today, particularly as Old Navy competes for that value-oriented customer who has options, both online and with other discounters. And are you seeing any benefits from a trade-down customer in your stores?Katrina O’Connell : Yes, Brooke, I mean what we’re seeing is that some of the brands that are really winning with our consumer are T.J. Maxx, Amazon, Shein, we’re definitely seeing those businesses gaining share. And those compete with our customer. We’re also seeing strong brands like Nike and Lulu and Adidas win, which tells us that great brands win in any economic environment. Old Navy has the benefit of being the #2 brand behind Nike. And so it is a big player in the branded space as well as being a retailer. So I’m thrilled to have Richard on Board with his experience in creating relevant brands. And that brand already has such a strong positioning. I think we have a lot to do there to keep winning in that space.So more to come there, but we’re glad with their positioning for sure. Trade-down benefit, we’re not currently seeing any trade-down benefit. That said, we’re certainly positioned to add value to any consumer as we move forward since our goal is to have great fashion at a great value. So -- but we’re not seeing that yet.Brooke Roach : If I could just follow up on one other topic. We’ve heard a number of companies this week address credit and card portfolios amidst some of the macro concerns that we’re seeing in the environment broadly. Can you provide a brief update on how you’re planning your credit business and what might be planned in your outlook for the rest of the year?Katrina O’Connell : Yes, it’s a good question, Brook. And certainly, we’re watching that, too. So any trends in credit card income that we see from industry reports or see within our own business are currently reflected in the outlook we provided today. We do see same as the industry reports loss rates increasing from the recent lows in ‘21 and ‘22. However, ours are not back to pre-pandemic levels yet. And we’re working with our credit card provider to adjust our underwriting strategies to make sure we’re mitigating risk of higher delinquencies, while still providing our customers with flexibility. So we’re actively monitoring the consumer environment. We’re watching the impact to credit and all of the trends on the credit card customer, again, are in the outlook we just provided.Operator: Thank you. We’ve reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I’ll now turn the call over to Richard Dickson for closing remarks.Richard Dickson: Thank you. I’d like to thank all of you for your time, your interest and your questions. And I just want to reiterate my belief in Gap Inc., our people, our brands and how truly thrilled I am to be the CEO of this extraordinary company. I also just want to thank the people of Gap Inc. for this incredibly warm welcome and to thank Bobby in particular, for his tireless leadership over the past year and for igniting transformative work that I really am eager to pick up and run with. And all of you who joined the call today, I look forward to meeting all of you in the coming weeks and months, and thank you all for joining.Operator: Thank you. That does conclude our conference call. You may now disconnect.]"
