The company's market worth decreased by US$4.0b over the past week after the stock price dropped 4.3%, although insiders were able to minimize their lossesAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$25m worth of shares at a price of US$80.10 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$49.35). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$17m for 275.84k shares. But they sold 1.87m shares for US$140m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Charles Schwab shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Charles Schwab better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Charles Schwab Insiders Are Selling The StockThere was substantially more insider selling, than buying, of Charles Schwab shares over the last three months. In that time, insiders dumped US$49m worth of shares. On the flip side, insiders spent US$7.9m on purchasing shares. Since the selling really does outweigh the buying, we'd say that these transactions may suggest that some insiders feel the company has been fully valued in recent months.Story continuesDoes Charles Schwab Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Charles Schwab insiders own about US$5.5b worth of shares (which is 6.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Indicate?The stark truth for Charles Schwab is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since Charles Schwab is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Charles Schwab you should know about.But note: Charles Schwab may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.31bUS$5.54bUS$6.69bUS$8.77bUS$11.0bUS$12.7bUS$14.1bUS$15.3bUS$16.3bUS$17.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 15.14%Est @ 11.22%Est @ 8.47%Est @ 6.55%Est @ 5.21% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.7% US$3.9kUS$4.6kUS$5.1kUS$6.0kUS$6.9kUS$7.2kUS$7.3kUS$7.3kUS$7.0kUS$6.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$62bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$17b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.7%– 2.1%) = US$228bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$228b÷ ( 1 + 9.7%)10= US$90bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$152b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$178, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.292. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Texas InstrumentsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to Charlotte McLaughlin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Charlotte, please go ahead.Charlotte McLaughlin: Thank you, Liz. Good morning and welcome to the Acuity Brands fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and information currently available to our management at this time. These beliefs are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control, including those detailed in our periodic SEC filings. Please note that our company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated and we undertake no obligation to update these results. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial metrics with their corresponding GAAP measures are available in our 2023 second quarter earnings release which is available on our Investor Relations website at www.investors.acuitybrands.com.With me this morning is Neil Ashe, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an update on our strategy and our fiscal second quarter highlights and Karen Holcom, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will walk us through our fiscal second quarter financial performance. There will be an opportunity for Q&amp;A at the end of this call. We are webcasting today's conference call live. Thank you for your interest in Acuity Brands. I will now turn the call over to Neil Ashe.Neil Ashe: Thank you, Charlotte. Good morning and welcome to all of you joining us on this call. We delivered solid performance again in the second quarter of fiscal '23. We grew sales in both our lighting and spaces businesses, expanded adjusted operating profit and grew adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated strong cash flow from operations and created permanent value for shareholders through share repurchases. Both our lighting and spaces businesses delivered solid revenue while improving adjusted operating profit. In the Acuity Brands, lighting and Lighting Controls business, our strategy of increasing product vitality and service levels continue to differentiate us in the market. A few weeks ago, we hosted our annual sales conference in Atlanta, NEXT 23.Story continuesIt was a great event, where we brought together our network of independent sales agents and shared our strategic vision for ABL and introduced new products. I'd like to take a minute to describe our independent sales network. Stated simply, we have the best agency network in the industry. To give you an idea of their scope, we have about 80 agents in North America and they have about 50 employees per agency. In other words, we have over 4,000 local sales and sales support people working for us every day throughout North America. While our agents are independent, they are exclusive to us for key controls and do not represent the other majors. They are generally the largest in their market and we are their most important partner. Our partnership works very well.With our product vitality and service efforts, we make products that deserve to be chosen and our independent sales agents ensure that they are chosen. Product vitality is driving success across our portfolio and during NEXT 23, we introduced several new products. I want to highlight a couple here. The first was the new nLight AIR System Input Device. This is an indoor controller that can be used in multiple spaces, including office, commercial and retail. The device converts analog outputs to wireless broadcast to control intelligent luminaires. This reduces the need for complex wiring solutions during installation and reduces the associated cost for the customer. The second was the nLight AIR rPOD Micro. This is a battery-powered wall switch that can be used as a traditional wall switch or as a remote, providing control from anywhere within a build space.buildings, real estate, workerPhoto by Tolu Olubode on UnsplashThis is a really exciting extension of the technology and an elegant response to our customers' need for flexibility. These and other products continue to gain market attention. This quarter, several of our architectural lighting brands, A-Light, Eureka and Luminis, won a total of eight Good Design Awards from the Chicago Athenaeum which recognizes products and industry leaders in design and manufacturing that have chartered new directions for innovation. Now moving to our Intelligent Spaces Group. The spaces team continued to perform well, delivering another quarter of solid sales and operating profit growth, driven by the continued success of Distech. Distech is winning because we have the best digital control solutions in the market. It's technology is open protocol which means you can connect our controller to most new or existing systems in a build space, giving our customers significant flexibility.We are also winning because Distech goes to market through independent system integrators. We are continually curating the highest quality network of SIs in each market in which we compete. Our focus is on expanding the addressable market for Distech which we have started to do in two ways. The first is geographic, as we mentioned last quarter. Today, we sell our controls primarily in the U.S., Canada and France and we are expanding our presence in the U.K. and in the future in Asia. As we enter new markets, we are identifying and recruiting the highest-quality SIs as our partners. Second, we believe that any control that is currently mechanical or analog will become digital over time. So we are increasing what we can control and build spaces; this will provide us a second vector for continued growth.Finally, I also joined our spaces team at the AHR Expo in Atlanta, where HVACR professionals gathered to share ideas and to showcase technology. It was great to hear firsthand from the SIs there, how differentiated our Distech and Atrius products are. Now looking to the rest of fiscal 2023. We've been intentional around our product vitality and service efforts and how we operate the business. We have demonstrated our ability to manage price and cost, both in our go-to-market efforts and in our operations. Today, we are in greater control of the things we can control than we have ever been. As you know, there are meaningful changes in the economic climate. During the quarter, we began to see a slowing in the order rate for our project business, while we continue to work through our extended backlog.We believe that the slower order rate is driven by the lead time compression that we discussed last quarter and now the changing C&amp;I lending environment. At the same time, our Contractor Select business continued to be strong. We will continue our focus on end markets and identifying new ways to grow. As we deal with these changing market conditions, our focus is on generating profits and turning those profits into cash. We are continuing to manage the price/cost relationship and we'll continue to generate strong cash flow. In closing, we entered the second half of fiscal '23 with our strategy unchanged. We are in control of what we can control and we are confident in our ability to adapt to the changing market conditions and requirements of our customers.Now I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will update you on our second quarter performance.Karen Holcom: Thank you, Neil. We delivered a solid performance in the second quarter of 2023. Sales in both businesses grew, delivering improved adjusted operating profit and margins and adjusted diluted EPS. We generated strong cash flow from operations and continued to allocate capital effectively. In the second quarter, we generated net sales of $944 million which is 4% higher than the prior year. This was largely due to price with both the ABL and ISG businesses contributing to the growth during the quarter. Operating profit in the second quarter was $112 million and adjusted operating profit increased $10 million to $132 million from the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin improved 50 basis points over the prior year to 14%.The improvement in adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin was a result of the increase in gross profit performance as we successfully managed price and cost. Finally, we continued to grow adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our diluted earnings per share of $2.57 was an increase of $0.44 or 21% year-over-year while our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.06 increased $0.49 or 19% over the prior year. The growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share was primarily due to higher operating profit and lower shares outstanding due to the share repurchases. Moving to our segment performance review. ABL, net sales grew to $891 million, an increase of 3% compared with the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher year-over-year sales in our independent sales network, the direct sales network and the retail channel.As Neil mentioned, the order rate related to our project business slowed during the quarter, However, our Contractor Select business targeted at distributors and retail continued to grow. ABL's operating profit was $124 million, an increase of 6% versus the prior year with ABL adjusted operating profit at $133 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. The adjusted operating profit margin was 15% which was 30 basis points better than last year. The improvement was a result of our ability to manage price and cost. Now moving to ISG. The spaces segment continued to perform well with another good quarter of net sales growth and improved adjusted operating profit. Sales in the second quarter of 2023 were $58 million, an increase of $8 million or 16% versus the prior year, primarily as a result of the growth in Distech.During the quarter, both Distech and Atrius delivered growth across new and existing customers. Operating profit in the second quarter of 2023 increased to approximately $6 million this quarter, with ISG adjusted operating profit at $11 million. Now, I want to expand on our cash flow performance. We generated $306 million of cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of fiscal 2023, an increase of $179 million over the prior year's first half, driven largely by improvements in working capital. Last year, we invested in inventory in order to support our growth as well as insulate our production facilities from inconsistent supply availability with the intention of working down that inventory over several quarters which we have done.We are now down 16 inventory days from the peak in February of 2022 and we have brought inventory levels down by over $50 million sequentially from the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We also invested $36 million in capital expenditures and $124 million to repurchase approximately 700,000 shares during the first half of fiscal 2023. As we said before, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We have invested for growth in our current businesses through R&amp;D and CapEx. We've expanded our platform through acquisitions as evidenced by the purchase of OPTOTRONIC in our lighting business. We've maintained our dividend and we've created a permanent shareholder value through over $1.1 billion of share repurchases since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 which was funded by our organic cash flow generation.Before I turn the call to the operator for questions, I want to summarize our performance. We continued to deliver solid performance in the second quarter of 2023. We grew sales in both our lighting and spaces businesses, we improved adjusted operating profit and margins and grew adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated strong cash flow from operations and created a permanent value for shareholders through share repurchases. Our guidance provided for fiscal 2023 remains unchanged and we are continuing to focus on what we can control and position ourselves to quickly adapt to changing market conditions. Thank you for joining us today. I will now pass you over to the operator to take your questions.See also 15 Fastest Growing QSR Chains in India and 12 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Now.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:CF) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 17% in that time. But in three years the returns have been great. In three years the stock price has launched 130% higher: a great result. After a run like that some may not be surprised to see prices moderate. The fundamental business performance will ultimately dictate whether the top is in, or if this is a stellar buying opportunity.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.CF Industries Holdings was able to grow its EPS at 97% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 32% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 4.19 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that CF Industries Holdings has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for CF Industries Holdings the TSR over the last 3 years was 148%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 9.2% in the twelve months, CF Industries Holdings shareholders did even worse, losing 33% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 16% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand CF Industries Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for CF Industries Holdings  you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $1.72 billion compared to $1.55 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 10.8%. While price increases contributed at a higher level than historically, revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume.Story continuesOur sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter was $231.6 million compared to $213 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 7.8%. The segment was up against a difficult revenue comparison because last year's third quarter revenue included about $15 million in sales of COVID-19 test kits that did not repeat this year. Excluding the prior year test kit sales, the organic revenue growth rate was 16%. We continue to have good momentum in our First Aid Cabinet business, which continues to grow greater than 20%.Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the all other segment. All other revenue was $242.2 million compared to $194.3 million last year. The fire business revenue was 105 -- $155.8 million and the organic revenue growth rate was 20.7%. Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $86.5 million and the organic growth rate was 32%. Now before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance.We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.67 billion to $8.75 billion to a range of $8.74 billion to $8.80 billion. The total growth rate of 11.3% to 12%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $12.50 to $12.80 to a range of $12.70 to $12.90, a growth rate of 12.6% to 14.4%.

Dollar strength makes oil more expensive for other currency holders and can weigh on demand.Brent crude settled down 96 cents, or 0.2%, at $84.58 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate also fell 94, or 0.1%, to $79.74. Both benchmarks fell by more than $1 earlier in the session""We look for this week's trade to be heavily influenced by inflation data featured by Wednesday's CPI and Thursday's PPI that will likely revive the specter of higher interest rates that could strengthen the U.S. dollar,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois.Crude last week jumped more than 6% after OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia, surprised the market with a new round of production cuts starting in May.Oil also drew support from a steeper-than-expected drop in U.S. crude inventories last week, as well as a decline in gasoline and distillate stocks, hinting at rising demand.In global financial markets, a U.S. inflation report to be released on Wednesday could help investors gauge the near-term trajectory for interest rates.Also coming up are monthly reports from OPEC on Thursday and the International Energy Agency on Friday, which will update oil demand and supply forecasts.(Additional reporting by Alex Lawler; Additional reporting by Florence Tan in Singapore and Mohi Narayan in New Delhi; Editing by Christopher Cushing, Kirsten Donovan, Barbara Lewis and Sandra Maler)]"

To skip the detailed analysis and latest updates on the oil industry, go directly to the Top 5 Oil Producing Countries in the World.Even though the world is moving toward renewable energy sources at a fast pace due to climate change issues, crude oil is still essential to the global economy and is here to stay for a long time. Currently, Brent Crude oil is the most traded commodity in the world followed by West Texas Intermediate Crude oil. In 2022, over 246.9 million Futures and Options Contracts of Brent Crude oil were traded on the Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE). We previously mentioned that the global crude oil market was worth $1.4 trillion in 2021 and is expected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2029. The CAGR of 1.8% may seem slow but it is because the crude oil industry is quite mature and high volatility is expected in the coming years.Latest Updates on the Crude Oil MarketOne of the major events that is still affecting the global crude oil market is the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which we discussed in detail in one of our previous articles. Up until now, the EU has sanctioned around €91.2 billion worth of imports from Russia, and a large part of it consists of oil and gas. As of February 5, the EU has banned all seaborne petroleum products from Russia which has led the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) to update its previous outlook to an average Brent Crude oil price forecast of $85 per barrel for the second quarter of 2022 from the prior $83 per barrel. The ban was announced in December 2022 and was implemented in February 2023. The EIA predicts that the average per-barrel price will show no major changes through the second quarter of 2023 and will start to decline through the end of 2024. For 2023, the EIA expects the annual average price of Brent Crude oil to be around $83 per barrel and decline to $78 per barrel in 2024.Story continuesCrude Oil StocksIn 2022, US crude oil exports hit a record high of 3.6 million barrels a day, mostly due to sanctions on Russian imports. Due to that, crude oil stocks enjoyed one of the best times in 2022. The top 5 US oil companies posted a profit of almost $200 billion in the year.However, in the last three months, the stocks have taken a beating with ETFs such as Direxion Daily S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exp. &amp; Prod. Bull 2X Shares (NYSEARCA: GUSH) declining by almost 21%, and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF (NYSEARCA: UCO) decreasing by 10.2% at the time of writing.Top 25 Oil Producing Countries in the WorldPhoto by Viktor Kharlashkin on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list, we calculated the mean value of the monthly production volume of each country from January to December 2022, based on the data taken from the Trading Economics website. A few of these figures might have changed depending on any new data updates or modifications. The countries are listed in ascending order of their crude oil production in 2022. For Russia's production, due to varying figures from multiple sources, we took the country's production figures from S&amp;P Global.For crude oil, we used a more strict definition of crude oil and did not include NGPL and other liquids. Had we used a broader definition of crude oil, the oil production of some countries would have been be higher than what’s on this list.Top 25 Oil Producing Countries in the World25. IndiaCrude Oil Production in 2022: 605,186 barrels per dayIndia’s global oil production has remained flat over the years but its population is growing quite fast. The country had a population of 1.34 billion in 2020 which reached nearly 1.4 billion in 2022. Due to that, the demand for imported oil has been growing in India and it is expected that in 2023, the country’s oil imports will reach 87% from 85.7% in 2022.24. IndonesiaCrude Oil Production in 2022: 612,300 barrels per dayIndonesian oil production has been declining since 1990 while the demand has been rising significantly. The country became a net oil importer in 2004. Some of the problems that Indonesia is facing in oil production are the lack of investments in old fields and changing government policies. However, the country plans to increase its oil lifting to 1 million barrels per day by 2030.23. AzerbaijanCrude Oil Production in 2022: 657,122 barrels per dayAzerbaijan is an oil-rich country and a notable part of its economy depends on oil and gas production. Between 1898 and 1901, the country was responsible for 50% of global oil production. As of December 2021, Azerbaijan had crude oil reserves of around 7 billion barrels. In 2022, Azerbaijan produced 657,122 barrels per day of crude oil, and the EIA believes that the country will produce 640,000 to 670,000 barrels of oil per day in 2023.22. VenezuelaCrude Oil Production in 2022: 717,083Venezuela’s crude oil production has been declining over the years due to sanctions put forth by the US. The US brought the sanctions upon the country as Venezuela demanded larger shares of revenues from international companies that had investments in the country.According to a Statistical Review of World Energy by BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), Venezuela is home to the largest oil reserves in the world. By 2020, the country had proven oil reserves of 303.8 billion barrels, compared to 297.5 billion in Saudi Arabia.21. United KingdomCrude Oil Production in 2022: 754,166 barrels per dayThe United Kingdom’s crude oil production has consistently been dropping for the past few decades. In 2022, the country’s total oil production dropped by almost 65 million barrels per day and is expected to decrease even further till 2026. The entirety of the UK’s oil reserves is found offshore.At the end of 2021, the UK had oil reserves of around 4 billion barrels.20. ColumbiaCrude Oil Production in 2022: 754,200 barrels per dayIn 2022, Columbia’s crude oil production increased by 2.4% from 796,164 barrels per day in 2021 to 754,200 barrels per day in 2022. Previously, the country’s fossil fuel production was declining due to National Liberation Army’s attacks on oil pipelines. Columbia’s oil production declined notably in 2021 but showed signs of recovery in 2022. According to EIA, 14,000 barrels of oil production were disrupted per day in Columbia in 2021.19. LibyaCrude Oil Production in 2022: 1.018 million barrels per dayLibya’s economy is largely dependent on oil and natural gas and is one of the richest countries in Africa. It is an OPEC country and joined the organization in 1962. Libya’s daily crude oil production was 1.018 million barrels per day which were largely affected by low production outputs between April to July 2022. The country’s lowest production month was June with only 632,000 barrels of oil per day.18. AlgeriaCrude Oil Production in 2022: 1.020 million barrels per dayAlgeria is the largest country in Africa. Most of the country is dependent on oil, gas, and other natural resources like iron ore, phosphates, uranium, and lead. As of 2022, the country has proven oil reserves of 12.2 billion barrels. Algeria exports around 60% of its produced oil each year.17. OmanCrude Oil Production in 2022: 1.06 million barrels per dayThe majority of Oman’s economy is dependent on mineral fuels, especially oil. Apart from that, the tourism industry is also catching pace in the country. In December 2022, the country experienced a remarkable surge in imports to Japan at 179.3%. In addition, Oman’s oil exports to South Korea increased by almost 93% YoY.16. AngolaCrude Oil Production in 2022: 1.14 million barrels per dayCurrently, Angola has proven oil reserves of around 9 billion barrels. However, it is estimated that the country might have 57 billion barrels of un-proven oil reserves. The same contrast is seen with its proven and unproven natural gas reserves.Angola is the second largest oil producer in Africa with 1.14 million barrels per day of crude oil production in 2022.15. NigeriaCrude Oil Production in 2022: 1.144 million barrels per dayNigeria holds the second-largest proven oil reserves in Africa with 36.89 billion barrels. However, its oil production often gets severely disrupted due to pipeline thefts. In 2022, the country expected a daily output of 1.88 million barrels but fell short by almost 736,000 barrels per day. According to our calculations, this amounts to a loss of $26.864 billion after multiplying the total with 2022’s average Brent crude oil spot price of $100.14. QatarCrude Oil Production in 2022: 1.321 million barrels per dayQatar is the world’s richest country with a GDP per capita of $129,360. Oil and natural gas exports are one of the most significant sources of income for the country. Except for the first two months of 2022, Qatar’s daily crude oil production remained stable at 1.322 million barrels per day for every month. As of 2021, Qatar had proven oil reserves of 25.24 billion barrels.13. NorwayCrude Oil Production in 2022: 1.55 million barrels per dayNorway is a part of the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Oil covers 0.2% of the GDP of OECD countries with the exception of Norway. Compared to its size and population, it is a relatively oil-rich country, and the commodity covers 4.3% of Norway’s GDP. In June 2022, the country experienced its lowest oil production for the year at 1.35 million barrels of oil per day. Later in August, Norway’s oil production reached its peak for the year at 1.808 million barrels of oil per day.12. KazakhstanCrude Oil Production in 2022: 1.7 million barrels per dayKazakhstan accounts for 3% of the global oil reserves with approximately 30 billion barrels of oil reserves. However, it is predicted that there are at least 60-100 billion barrels of oil that are yet to be proven in the Kazakh part of the Caspian Sea. In the Caspian Sea region, Kazakhstan holds the largest proven oil reserves.11. MexicoCrude Oil Production in 2022: 1.71 million barrels per dayMexico’s crude oil production capacity has been declining over the last decade. In December 2012, the country’s oil production was over 2.5 million barrels a day which reached around 1.71 million barrels per day in 2022. Despite that, it is one of the largest exporters of crude oil to the US.10. IranCrude Oil Production in 2022: 2.54 million barrels per dayAccording to OPEC, Iran’s average production for 2022 increased by 140,000 barrels per day to 2.54 million barrels per day. The country reached its peak production for the year in December with 2.58 million barrels per day.Iran is quite secretive when it comes to its oil export data. According to EIA, the country exports around 600,000 barrels per day. Nevertheless, the data for Iran’s oil export varies from source to source and it is somewhere between 600,000 to 1.2 million barrels per day.9. KuwaitCrude Oil Production in 2022: 2.7 million barrels per dayKuwait’s daily oil production averaged 2.7 million barrels per day, showing a significant increase from the prior year. By 2025, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation plans to increase its daily production to 3.5 million barrels. Most of the country’s oil production operations are in the South East of Kuwait at the Greater Burgan field which produces over 1.6 million barrels per day.Over 90% of Kuwait’s income is oil dependent. For the fiscal year 2022, which ends on March 31, 2023, Kuwait’s oil revenues are expected to be approximately or over $82 billion due to the crude oil price hikes in 2022.8. BrazilCrude Oil Production in 2022: 3021.7 million barrels per dayBrazil is the biggest oil producer in South America. Close to 97% of Brazil’s oil reserves are offshore and the International Energy Agency believes that by 2040, Brazil will account for over half of the global offshore oil.Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) is the biggest Brazilian oil and gas company and it accounts for over 70% of the country’s oil and gas production.7. United Arab EmiratesCrude Oil Production in 2022: 3.064 million barrels per dayAmong the OPEC countries, UAE is the third largest oil producer. Nevertheless, according to CNBC, UAE is looking to exit OPEC as Abu Dhabi, the city where 96% of the country’s oil reserves are, demands its own baseline.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. The electric power industry experienced a year full of challenges and opportunities in 2022. Despite the pandemic recovery, electricity sales in the US rose by 3.6% during the first eight months of the year compared to the previous year. However, the sector also faced increased costs due to natural gas prices more than doubling as a result of global shortages that were worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, extreme climate events such as droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, and wildfires continued to test the resilience of regional grids. As a response to these challenges, the industry and policymakers worked on improving reserves, deploying energy storage and microgrids, strengthening infrastructure, and enhancing flexible load options.It is expected that in 2023, the positive advancements seen in the electric power sector will continue to progress. However, the task of providing secure, reliable, affordable, and clean electricity could become more difficult due to various challenges. Elevated electricity prices may persist due to inflation, high fuel costs, and supply chain disruptions. Additionally, managing extreme weather, cybersecurity risks, and the growth of variable renewables and distributed energy resources may require innovative solutions to ensure grid reliability. Despite these challenges, new technologies and supportive policies could create opportunities in 2023 and aid the industry in achieving its objectives.Utilities are facing mounting pressure due to increasing expenses and rates, as well as growing regulatory scrutiny, changing customer expectations, and investor demands for consistent returns. To address these challenges, a technology-forward approach, expanding the use of operational technology, and digitizing the back office can benefit both the customer and the utility financially, while also creating more efficient operations. Story continuesAlthough distributed generation offers benefits such as energy independence for end customers, its widespread emergence on a distribution grid can create issues for electric utilities. Furthermore, the move towards a clean energy future adds pressure on utilities to find creative solutions for production and transmission. Full electrification will require a multi-pronged approach, including government funding, leveraging hydrogen and renewable natural gas, and utilizing a portfolio approach with multiple technologies to keep costs down and achieve net-zero goals. Similarly, the focus on decarbonization to address climate change and worsening air quality is driving acceleration in transportation and building electrification, investments in renewable energy, and new energy market participation. To benefit from the advancements and opportunities in the utilities sector, some of the best stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED), and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO). However, we discuss the best cheap utility stocks to invest in this article.

Approximately 70% of its revenue comes from Texas, where it owns one of the largest natural gas pipeline systems in the state.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Atmos Energy include:-Strong balance sheet and financial strength, perhaps most visible during 2021’s winter storm Uri when millions of Texans lost power. The significant spikes in natural gas prices stressed distributors, but Atmos handled over $2 billion of incremental costs with little long-term impact;-Experienced and shareholder-friendly management team, as demonstrated by 38 consecutive years of dividend increases; and-Attractive demographics and favorable regulatory environments in the states where it operates.Attractive ValuationGiven our estimates of higher normalized earnings and dividend payments, we believe shares of Atmos Energy are trading at a discount relative to our estimate of their intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Atmos Energy, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Old pipes and aging infrastructure, coupled with a growing population, have created a large backlog of safety and maintenance projects – completion of which should drive earnings growth and steady dividend increases. Updates should both increase reliability as well as the value of Atmos Energy’s assets, enhancing profit levels permitted by regulators;-Well positioned to source low-cost natural gas from prolific basins in Texas to its distribution network, helping to keep customer prices down and economically favorable relative to other sources of energy; and-Advantageous regulatory environment should continue to support rate adjustments so that revenues are earned on capital projects within six to 12 months.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.  Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

A conflicting Washington state ruling on Friday blocks changes to pill sales in 17 states.In January, the Food and Drug Administration made a regulatory change that made it possible for retail pharmacies to offer abortion pills in the country for the first time, but more than a dozen states have passed laws limiting such sales.There are no retail pharmacies that are currently certified to dispense mifepristone and many are going through the certification process.""We are discussing ways to offer them legal support,"" one of the sources said of manufacturers and retail pharmacies.Options being discussed include having the U.S. Department of Justice back any legal challenges brought against manufacturers and pharmacies, and providing legal advice on how they can continue dispensing the pills, the sources said. The DOJ is separately seeking an emergency stay of the Texas order.The White House does not direct the DOJ's litigation strategy, a senior administration official said. The official also said the Justice Department does not provide legal advice to private entities. There is a separate volunteer process that gets private attorneys and law firms to do legal work on different issues that the agency oversees.It was not immediately clear which companies will be involved in these discussions. The White House declined comment.Story continuesMajor U.S. manufacturers of abortion pills include GenBioPro Inc and Danco Laboratories. Pharmacy chains dispensing such pills include Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc , CVS Health Corp and Rite Aid Corp.Walgreens said in March it would not dispense abortion pills in the 20 states where it risked breaking the law.On Sunday, Walgreens declined comment. The other companies did not respond to a request for comment on any discussions with the White House.The administration official said the White House has ""absolutely previously connected with both pharmacies and manufacturers but we have not had any discussions on this since Friday when the decision came out.""Any potential future conversations will not include decisions that impact ""how the FDA will operate or is operating,"" the official said.The White House's Gender Policy Council, Inter Governmental Affairs and the vice president's office have been holding strategy calls for nearly two months on how to make medical abortion available after the Texas judge ruled, anticipating Friday's outcome.Discussions between the Biden administration and pill manufacturers and pharmacies over the issue have been ongoing for months, sources said, but Friday's decision brings fresh urgency.RELIEF FROM WASHINGTON STATEA flurry of White House strategy calls on Friday and Saturday also focused on ""immediate, short-term"" relief offered by the conflicting order from Washington state , three sources said.Minutes after Texas judge Kacsmaryk's order, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rice in Spokane, Washington, an Obama appointee, ordered the FDA not to make any changes to mifepristone access in some Democrat-led states.The administration believes that the Washington ruling gives it more time to respond legally to Texas's final decision. It could ""expedite review of Texas, encourage an immediate stay on it and puts a huge question mark over it,"" one of the sources said.Politically, the sources said, it makes it easier for the White House to make its case to the public that the FDA approval of the drug was accurate, mobilize activists and supporters to turn the issue into one that resonates with voters ahead of the 2024 presidential elections.""There's a lot of legal analysis that needs to get done...about how these two orders interact,"" the senior administration official said.President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris said on Friday the administration will fight the Texas ruling.""We're going to fight it. The Attorney General has announced @TheJusticeDept will file an appeal and seek an immediate stay of the decision,"" Biden tweeted. The legal battle is likely to work through multiple levels of appeals courts over a period of months or years before it is resolved.The administration is seeking an emergency stay of Kacsmaryk's order from the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The path forward discussed during the White House strategy calls touched on how the DOJ will wait for a decision from the 5th Circuit, which has a conservative reputation, the sources said.If it does not stay the ruling, the department will seek an expedited review by the Supreme Court, they said.(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Editing by Heather Timmons, Marguerita Choy and Diane Craft)]"

If you’re an investor looking for stocks to buy, you’re probably feeling pretty good about your chances for a good April.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1% for the year but has been building much-needed momentum over the last several weeks. The S&amp;P 500 is up 6% in 2023, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shows a 14% gain.But this isn’t the time to stand pat. The world’s still spinning, and market conditions change rapidly. OPEC announced that it’s cutting production, which will directly affect oil prices. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates and battle high inflation, and Congress and President Biden are wrestling with the debt ceiling, setting up a showdown that could significantly impact the economy.I’ve used my Portfolio Grader to identify the best stocks to buy in April as we launch into the year’s second quarter. The Portfolio Grader evaluates and grades stocks to buy based on performance, earnings history, momentum, analyst sentiment and quantitative measurements. It assigns a grade from “A” to “F” to each name – and just like in school, you want to be shooting for straight As on your report card.Here are seven A-rated stocks to buy for April to keep your portfolio in top-notch shape.VLOValero Energy $133.29BPBP $39.71DGIIDigi International $32.72AEHRAehr Test Systems $28.07ARDXArdelyx $4.40CPRXCatalyst Pharmaceuticals $17.22TJXTJX Companies $78.14Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is a downstream oil and gas company that is the world’s largest producer of renewable fuels. Valero’s ethanol plants can produce dry distillers’ grains, ethanol and corn oil for gasoline blenders and refiners.Story continuesRenewable energy is a coveted space that becomes more appealing with OPEC’s production cuts and the rising oil price. The global ethanol market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.8% through 2027, reaching $129.3 billion.Valero reported fourth-quarter earnings of $41.75 billion, that was 17.5% better than a year ago. While it narrowly missed analysts’ revenue estimates, the company showed solid profits by posting earnings per share of $8.45, which was better than analysts’ expectations of $7.25.VLO stock is up 25% over the last 12 months and provides a 3% dividend yield, which is a nice perk all by itself. VLO has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader and it one of the better stocks to buy on oil price increases.BP (BP)BP stock: the BP company logo on a buildingSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com BP (NYSE:BP) is in a prominent position to profit from higher oil and gas prices. It’s already coming off its most profitable year, banking $27.7 billion in 2022 (compared to $12.8 billion in 2021). It also is in a prime position to continue profiting from the European energy market, which sees tight supply because Russia invaded Ukraine and Moscow’s subsequent cuts of natural gas to the West.BP is also expected to complete its TravelCenters of America (NYSE:TA) acquisition by mid-year. The $1.3 billion deal will give BP an additional 281 fuel stations in 44 U.S. states and another opportunity to capitalize on rising oil prices, making it one of the best multi-stream stocks to buy.BP has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Digi International (DGII)5G digital hologram floating over a phone on a city background. representing 5g stocks investing for the next decadeSource: Fit Ztudio / Shutterstock.comDigi International (NASDAQ:DGII) is a Minnesota-based company that develops products and solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT). Digi’s products and services support retail, banking, medical and transportation industries, helping them create next-generation connected products and manage infrastructure.Digi has been a consistent winner on Wall Street, with earnings for the fiscal first quarter 2023 (ending Dec. 31, 2022) coming in at $109.3 million, or 29.7% better than the previous year. Digi is projecting fiscal Q2 revenue to be $105 million to $109 million, with analysts’ consensus estimates at $104.5 million. It’s one of the more interesting stocks to buy in the sector.DGII stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Aehr Test Systems (AEHR)Illustration of an electric car charging outside of a city with wind turbines in the background; EVSource: petovarga / ShutterstockI consider Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) a calculated gamble, even with its “A” rating, but it’s still worth your attention because it has massive potential.Aehr makes the burn-in equipment in silicon carbine chips commonly found in electric vehicles. EVs are a growing market with tremendous upside: a compound annual growth rate of 17% through 2027 and a projected market of $858 billion. Each EV requires thousands of semiconductors, making Aehr’s services valuable.The problem is that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced it’s come up with a new power inverter that cuts reliance on silicon carbide. The announcement sent AEHR stock down 8% in a single day, but Aehr’s executives say its market won’t be impacted.That remains to be seen.Aehr posted fiscal third-quarter revenue of $17.2 million and earnings of 16 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $16 million and 14 cents per share. It also reiterated its guidance for the full fiscal year ending May 31 with sales between $60 million to $70 million. But its implied sales goal for the current quarter is $22.3 million, below the $23.6 million that Wall Street expects. That sent AEHR stock down 25% since April 1.Tesla’s new power inverter won’t be included on its vehicles until the next model platform, which is still in development. So I’m banking on Aehr to hit its revenue goals, at least, and churn out a solid return at a suddenly discounted price. AEHR stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Ardelyx (ARDX)Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.Source: Billion Photos / ShutterstockI won’t blame you if Ardelyx (NASDAQ:ARDX) isn’t on your radar right now. It’s a penny stock – for now – with a market capitalization of only $931 million.But it’s probably time to pay attention to this one.Based in Waltham, Massachusetts, Ardelyx is a rising pharmaceutical company. The company is glowing from its successful launch of Ibsrela, the brand name for tenapanor, used to treat irritable bowel syndrome.What’s exciting about this development, however, is that Ardelyx has paperwork before the Food and Drug Administration to use tenapanor to treat patients on dialysis with chronic kidney disease. Ardelyx would see projected sales of $800 million in five years if granted.Ardelyx won’t stay under the radar for long – shares are already up 55% this year. Happily, analysts are putting a consensus price target of $7.59 on ARDX stock, meaning it still has a 71% runway.You have time to get on board, but this bandwagon isn’t sticking around. ARDX stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comCatalyst Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CPRX) is at the forefront of developing medications to treat the aging population. Its top drug is Firdapse, which treats adults with Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, a rare condition that affects signals sent from nerves to muscles, making them unable to contract properly.Firdapse sales account for the company’s entire revenue stream, which was $61 million in Q4 (up 58% from a year ago).Catalyst is another company discounted severely right now because it faced some bad news. In late January, Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) announced plans for a generic version of Firdapse, and that news sent CPRX stock down 27%. Catalyst is working on a label expansion for Firdapse and purchasing U.S. rights to an epilepsy treatment developed by Eisai (OTCMKTS:ESAIY).For now, however, Catalyst is projecting continued growth. Its issued guidance for full-year 2023 revenue between $375 million and $385 million, which is well above the consensus analysts’ estimate of $337.6 million.As far as April goes, I think Catalyst remains a solid pick, and many agree. Shares have already rebounded 14% since bottoming out in January, and I expect that trend to continue. CPRX stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.TJX Companies (TJX)An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.comTJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), the parent company of well-known retailers such as T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Sierra, Homegoods and Homesense, offers discounted apparel and home goods by 20% to 60% below department stores or online retailers.TJX has roughly 4,700 stores in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Europe.Earnings for the company’s fiscal Q4 2023 (ending Jan. 28, 2023) included revenue of $14.52 billion, up 4.8% from a year ago and better than analysts’ expectations for $14.07 billion. It’s guiding for continued solid performance for this quarter, with projected comparable store sales to be up 2% to 3% and earnings per share to range from 68 cents to 71 cents.TJX stock is holding steady this year, down about 2% since January 1, but I’m expecting a solid April to make this one of the best retailers you can buy. And it also offers a decent dividend yield of 1.7%.Like other names on this list, TJX stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier held VLO, BP, DGII and CPRX.

While bullion, the safe haven of choice in uncertain times, ended last week less than $70 shy of its record high, it dropped below the round-number milestone on Monday after approaching two technical extremes: the upper band of its trading envelope (a measure built around moving price averages) and the 70 level on its 14-day relative strength index. Breaches of both can often signal to some traders that a reversal is in store.OilOil prices are benefiting from renewed concerns over a tightening market, especially after OPEC+’s surprise decision to slash more than 1 million barrels of daily output starting in May. Reports this week from OPEC, the IEA and EIA will shed further light on the supply picture, with further inventory drawdowns likely supporting price gains. Combined with a backdrop of global economic uncertainty and questions over the path of Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes, near-term volatility can also be expected.MiningStory continuesThe clock is ticking for Glencore Plc to convince investors of Teck Resources Ltd. to reject company plans to split its coal and metals operations at an April 26 vote, keeping alive the Swiss miner’s $23 billion takeover attempt. Glencore would still need to win over Teck’s management and shareholders to land the second-largest mining acquisition in Canada, where some of the world’s biggest deals have unfolded in the past two decades.

Teck Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Price called Glencore’s proposal a “non-starter” on a Monday call with investors.EmissionsThe Biden administration is expected this week to propose the toughest-ever curbs on pollution from new cars and light trucks, while stopping short of mandating zero-emission electric vehicles or barring the sale of conventional gas-powered models. The standards, to be released Wednesday by the US Environmental Protection Agency, are likely to govern tailpipe emissions from vehicle model years 2027-2032, according to people briefed on elements of the plan. While EV adoption is forecast to expand, BloombergNEF data show, growth could be limited in the near term by coming requirements governing what consumers are eligible to claim from Inflation Reduction Act tax credits of as much as $7,500 per vehicle.LNGThe world’s biggest purchasers of liquefied natural gas in Northeast Asia and Europe have shown less interest in buying spot cargoes of the fuel lately, as a milder winter has left surplus stockpiles available. That’s leaving emerging nations with an array of super-cooled gas shipments to meet electricity generation demand. The combined imports of India, Thailand and Latin America surged to 3.76 million tons last month, the highest level since August. The increased flows may bring relief to citizens, and stimulate economic growth. These nations held back on purchases when LNG prices were elevated last year, in some cases resulting in blackouts and power rationing.--With assistance from Doug Alexander, Jennifer A.

To skip the detailed analysis of the recent events in the natural gas industry, go to the Top 5 Natural Gas Producing Countries in the World.Natural Gas Market in 2022The global natural gas market went through staggering changes since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The bans on Russian imports by the US and EU led to an energy crisis in Europe because 39.2% of natural gas exports to Europe were through Russian pipelines. Russia has in turn blamed the West for the energy crisis and retaliated by shutting down supplies to three of its major pipelines that were supplying gas to Europe. The Russian piped gas supplies to Europe dropped by almost 50% YoY in 2022, recording the highest decline since the mid-1980s.The plan to cut off Russian imports didn’t have the expected effect on the Russian economy as the country has directed its oil supplies towards the Eastern countries and plans to supply natural gas to China. The plan is yet to be implemented as it will take significant time and investment to build pipelines toward China. Moreover, the International Monetary Fund had previously estimated that the Russian economy would contract by 2.3%, but earlier this year, the IMF changed its expectations and estimated that it will grow by 0.3% instead.To make things worse for Europe, in September 2022, the US said that it won’t be able to offset the drop in supply for winter due to its exports hitting a maximum. On top of that, Southern Europe experienced low rainfall which declined the energy produced by hydropower. However, Europe got a little lucky with the mild winter weather and healthy LNG inflows and the natural gas energy shortages weren’t as consequential as expected. Overall in 2022, Europe experienced a drop of 13% in natural gas demand. The highest decline in demand was experienced in the third quarter of 2022 and trade volumes decreased by 25% year-over-year. This decline in demand came after natural gas prices hit their highest in the EU at slightly over $70 per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) in August.Story continuesIn 2022, the global LNG volumes increased by 5.5%, yet due to high prices compared to the previous year, the trade value increased by almost 100% to $450 billion as the spot prices increased substantially due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Gas Market OutlookAccording to the IEA, natural gas consumption in the US is expected to decline by 2% in 2023 due to lower electricity demand and the country’s focus on increasing energy production through renewable sources. By the end of the first quarter of 2023, US natural gas consumption was expected to be around 99.1 billion cubic feet per day, representing a 5% decline YoY due to mild temperatures. Residential and commercial consumption is expected to decrease 11% YoY.Additionally, the global LNG trade volume is expected to increase by 4.3%, owing to the increase in European exports by roughly 6360 billion cubic feet.  According to The Business Research Company report, the global natural gas market is expected to reach $1.026 trillion in 2023 from $955.74 billion in 2022. By 2027, the global natural gas market is expected to reach $1.37 trillion, registering a CAGR of 7.5%.With the global rise in demand for natural gas, the most notable stocks in the natural gas industry are Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK), EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD). These three stocks have a TTM PE ratio lower than their peer average of 10.1x and also have a decent hedge fund sentiment according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds.Top 20 Natural Gas Producing Countries in the WorldPhoto by Max Bender on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe compiled a list of top natural gas-producing countries according to 2021 data provided by the US Energy Information Administration on the total volume of dry natural gas produced by each country in the year. We used 2021 data as a lot of countries have not provided their 2022 data yet. The countries are listed in ascending order of their annual production.Top 20 Natural Gas-Producing Countries in the World20. PakistanProduction in 2021: 1,179 billion cubic feetAccording to the US International Trade Administration, around 38% of Pakistan’s primary energy supply mix is covered by natural gas. It produces 4 billion cubic feet per day on average, compared to its demand of 6 to 8 billion cubic feet per day. According to the EIA, Pakistan has huge shale gas reserves but their potential is hard to reach due to geography, water scarcity, security issues, and low natural gas prices in the country.19. ThailandProduction in 2021: 1,284 billion cubic feetThailand is a hydrocarbon-producing country but due to its high energy demand, it is a net importer of oil and natural gas. In 2021, 75% of the country’s oil and gas needs were met through imports. Thailand has shown a downward trend in its natural gas production since 2019 and according to a 2021 Fitch Solutions report, the trend is going to continue through the decade.18. OmanProduction in 2021: 1,384 billion cubic feetOman is a major producer of oil and gas. In 2015, natural gas accounted for 35% of the country’s oil-gas mix. 17. ArgentinaProduction in 2021: 1,428 billion cubic feetAccording to the IEA, Argentina’s primary energy mix consists of 55% gas and 33% oil. The country has the second-largest shale gas reserves in its Patagonian south after the USA. Nevertheless, according to a Reuters report, the lack of fracking equipment can pose major problems for the country which desperately needs to add new pipelines.16. NigeriaProduction in 2021: 1,568 billion cubic feetNigeria has around 200 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. However, annually, gas production is significantly less, at 1,568 billion cubic feet in 2022. According to PWC, the country’s gas reserves hold the potential to add $18.3 billion to its gross economic value with around $4.2 billion covered by dry natural gas. However, due to security and financial challenges, Nigeria hasn’t reached its full potential yet.15. UzbekistanProduction in 2021: 1,755 billion cubic feetUzbekistan is a country rich in fossil fuels such as oil, gas, coal, and uranium. The country has been a big exporter of natural gas. However, in November 2022, its energy ministry announced that the country has reduced exports due to high demand for domestic use. In November 2022, the country’s daily exports decreased from over 353 million cubic feet per day to slightly over 35.3 million cubic feet per day.14. IndonesiaProduction in 2021: 2,082 billion cubic feetOver 60% of Indonesia’s natural gas production comes from its offshore fields. The four largest natural gas production fields in the country are in East Kalimantan, South Sumatra, North Sumatra, and the South Natuna Sea. Indonesia was the world’s 6th largest natural gas producer in 2000. However, over the years, the country has fallen several spots in terms of ranking.13. United Arab EmiratesProduction in 2021: 2,252 billion cubic feetAccording to the US International Trade Administration, 30% of UAE’s GDP and 13% of its exports are hydrocarbon-based. According to Mordor Intelligence, the country expects to increase its oil and gas production capacity with a CAGR of 2% between 2022 and 2027.Owing to the high demand for natural gas for domestic use, UAE is working on creating several artificial islands to produce natural gas. Together, these islands are expected to increase the country’s natural gas production capabilities by 3 billion cubic feet per day.12. EgyptProduction in 2021: 2,452 billion cubic feetEgypt is the largest natural gas producer in the Eastern Mediterranean region. According to the EIA, the country’s natural gas production picked up pace in 2017 with the opening of its Zohr field. In addition, in 2021, 87% of the natural gas produced by Egypt was used domestically.11. MalaysiaProduction in 2021: 2,507 billion cubic feetMalaysia is quite dependent on its fossil fuel exports. Before the pandemic in 2019, the industry accounted for over $34.5 billion in revenue, representing 14.5% of the country’s goods exported.In 2021, the country’s natural gas exports were worth $9.51 billion with Japan taking the largest share of those exports, followed by China and South Korea.10. TurkmenistanProduction in 2021: 3,073 billion cubic feetTurkmenistan has the world’s fourth-largest gas reserves but due to a lack of infrastructure and investments, the country hasn’t been producing natural gas to its full capacity. Moreover, Russia and Iran have been opposing the Trans-Caspian pipeline, which was supposed to connect to Europe. Nevertheless, Turkmenistan is the largest exporter to China. There are already three pipelines connected between the countries and Turkmenistan currently plans to build a fourth one to increase its exports to the country. 9. NorwayProduction in 2021: 4,066 billion cubic feetNorway has also recently received its 2022 natural gas production data, according to which, the country produced nearly 4372 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Moreover, due to the reduction in Russian gas imports in Europe in 2022, Norway’s natural gas exports were also significantly higher in 2022. The country exported over 4237 billion cubic feet in the year.8. Saudi ArabiaProduction in 2021: 4082 billion cubic feetAccording to our data taken from EIA, Saudi Arabia produced 4082 billion cubic feet of dry natural gas in 2021. Saudi Arabia’s new Jafurah project has the potential to be the crown jewel of the country’s natural gas production. The unconventional Jafurah gas field covers an area close to 6600 square miles and has estimated reserves of 200 trillion cubic feet.Saudi Aramco has begun its talks with equity investors to back a $110 billion investment in the field.7. AustraliaProduction in 2021: 5,196 billion cubic feetNatural gas was first discovered in Australia in 1890. Nearly 25% of the country’s energy needs are met by natural gas. In 2022, Australia’s liquified natural gas exports generated a revenue of $63.2 billion, representing an 86% year-over-year increase due to increased prices. The country exported around 81.4 million metric tonnes of LNG, up 0.5% from the previous year.6. QatarProduction in 2021: 5,968 billion cubic feetQatar is one of the biggest exporters of natural gas. In 2019, Qatar announced its plan to increase its natural gas production by 67% by 2027 to 126 million tons per annum (1 metric ton LNG = 48,700 cubic feet of natural gas).In 2021, Qatar started building 4 new production and export terminals and plans to build a couple more before 2030. Click to continue and see the Top 5 Natural Gas-Producing Countries in the World. Suggested Articles:25 Best Free PC Games of 2023Top 20 Women-Owned Companies in the US12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsDisclosure: None.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. The electric power industry experienced a year full of challenges and opportunities in 2022. Despite the pandemic recovery, electricity sales in the US rose by 3.6% during the first eight months of the year compared to the previous year. However, the sector also faced increased costs due to natural gas prices more than doubling as a result of global shortages that were worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, extreme climate events such as droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, and wildfires continued to test the resilience of regional grids. As a response to these challenges, the industry and policymakers worked on improving reserves, deploying energy storage and microgrids, strengthening infrastructure, and enhancing flexible load options.It is expected that in 2023, the positive advancements seen in the electric power sector will continue to progress. However, the task of providing secure, reliable, affordable, and clean electricity could become more difficult due to various challenges. Elevated electricity prices may persist due to inflation, high fuel costs, and supply chain disruptions. Additionally, managing extreme weather, cybersecurity risks, and the growth of variable renewables and distributed energy resources may require innovative solutions to ensure grid reliability. Despite these challenges, new technologies and supportive policies could create opportunities in 2023 and aid the industry in achieving its objectives.Utilities are facing mounting pressure due to increasing expenses and rates, as well as growing regulatory scrutiny, changing customer expectations, and investor demands for consistent returns. To address these challenges, a technology-forward approach, expanding the use of operational technology, and digitizing the back office can benefit both the customer and the utility financially, while also creating more efficient operations. Story continuesAlthough distributed generation offers benefits such as energy independence for end customers, its widespread emergence on a distribution grid can create issues for electric utilities. Furthermore, the move towards a clean energy future adds pressure on utilities to find creative solutions for production and transmission. Full electrification will require a multi-pronged approach, including government funding, leveraging hydrogen and renewable natural gas, and utilizing a portfolio approach with multiple technologies to keep costs down and achieve net-zero goals. Similarly, the focus on decarbonization to address climate change and worsening air quality is driving acceleration in transportation and building electrification, investments in renewable energy, and new energy market participation. To benefit from the advancements and opportunities in the utilities sector, some of the best stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED), and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO). However, we discuss the best cheap utility stocks to invest in this article.

Approximately 70% of its revenue comes from Texas, where it owns one of the largest natural gas pipeline systems in the state.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Atmos Energy include:-Strong balance sheet and financial strength, perhaps most visible during 2021’s winter storm Uri when millions of Texans lost power. The significant spikes in natural gas prices stressed distributors, but Atmos handled over $2 billion of incremental costs with little long-term impact;-Experienced and shareholder-friendly management team, as demonstrated by 38 consecutive years of dividend increases; and-Attractive demographics and favorable regulatory environments in the states where it operates.Attractive ValuationGiven our estimates of higher normalized earnings and dividend payments, we believe shares of Atmos Energy are trading at a discount relative to our estimate of their intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Atmos Energy, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Old pipes and aging infrastructure, coupled with a growing population, have created a large backlog of safety and maintenance projects – completion of which should drive earnings growth and steady dividend increases. Updates should both increase reliability as well as the value of Atmos Energy’s assets, enhancing profit levels permitted by regulators;-Well positioned to source low-cost natural gas from prolific basins in Texas to its distribution network, helping to keep customer prices down and economically favorable relative to other sources of energy; and-Advantageous regulatory environment should continue to support rate adjustments so that revenues are earned on capital projects within six to 12 months.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.  Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Dollar strength makes oil more expensive for other currency holders and can weigh on demand.Brent crude settled down 96 cents, or 0.2%, at $84.58 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate also fell 94, or 0.1%, to $79.74. Both benchmarks fell by more than $1 earlier in the session""We look for this week's trade to be heavily influenced by inflation data featured by Wednesday's CPI and Thursday's PPI that will likely revive the specter of higher interest rates that could strengthen the U.S. dollar,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois.Crude last week jumped more than 6% after OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia, surprised the market with a new round of production cuts starting in May.Oil also drew support from a steeper-than-expected drop in U.S. crude inventories last week, as well as a decline in gasoline and distillate stocks, hinting at rising demand.In global financial markets, a U.S. inflation report to be released on Wednesday could help investors gauge the near-term trajectory for interest rates.Also coming up are monthly reports from OPEC on Thursday and the International Energy Agency on Friday, which will update oil demand and supply forecasts.(Additional reporting by Alex Lawler; Additional reporting by Florence Tan in Singapore and Mohi Narayan in New Delhi; Editing by Christopher Cushing, Kirsten Donovan, Barbara Lewis and Sandra Maler)]"

49,bdc4b0d3-76a7-3a9f-bf77-f4ede17d318d,MA,2023-04-10,Top 20 Natural Gas-Producing Countries in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-natural-gas-producing-135029977.html,1681048229,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CHK', 'EQT', 'PXD']","[In this article, we discuss the top 20 natural gas-producing countries in the world. To skip the detailed analysis of the recent events in the natural gas industry, go to the Top 5 Natural Gas Producing Countries in the World.Natural Gas Market in 2022The global natural gas market went through staggering changes since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The bans on Russian imports by the US and EU led to an energy crisis in Europe because 39.2% of natural gas exports to Europe were through Russian pipelines. Russia has in turn blamed the West for the energy crisis and retaliated by shutting down supplies to three of its major pipelines that were supplying gas to Europe. The Russian piped gas supplies to Europe dropped by almost 50% YoY in 2022, recording the highest decline since the mid-1980s.The plan to cut off Russian imports didn’t have the expected effect on the Russian economy as the country has directed its oil supplies towards the Eastern countries and plans to supply natural gas to China. The plan is yet to be implemented as it will take significant time and investment to build pipelines toward China. Moreover, the International Monetary Fund had previously estimated that the Russian economy would contract by 2.3%, but earlier this year, the IMF changed its expectations and estimated that it will grow by 0.3% instead.To make things worse for Europe, in September 2022, the US said that it won’t be able to offset the drop in supply for winter due to its exports hitting a maximum. On top of that, Southern Europe experienced low rainfall which declined the energy produced by hydropower. However, Europe got a little lucky with the mild winter weather and healthy LNG inflows and the natural gas energy shortages weren’t as consequential as expected. Overall in 2022, Europe experienced a drop of 13% in natural gas demand. The highest decline in demand was experienced in the third quarter of 2022 and trade volumes decreased by 25% year-over-year. This decline in demand came after natural gas prices hit their highest in the EU at slightly over $70 per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) in August.Story continuesIn 2022, the global LNG volumes increased by 5.5%, yet due to high prices compared to the previous year, the trade value increased by almost 100% to $450 billion as the spot prices increased substantially due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Gas Market OutlookAccording to the IEA, natural gas consumption in the US is expected to decline by 2% in 2023 due to lower electricity demand and the country’s focus on increasing energy production through renewable sources. By the end of the first quarter of 2023, US natural gas consumption was expected to be around 99.1 billion cubic feet per day, representing a 5% decline YoY due to mild temperatures. Residential and commercial consumption is expected to decrease 11% YoY.Additionally, the global LNG trade volume is expected to increase by 4.3%, owing to the increase in European exports by roughly 6360 billion cubic feet.  According to The Business Research Company report, the global natural gas market is expected to reach $1.026 trillion in 2023 from $955.74 billion in 2022. By 2027, the global natural gas market is expected to reach $1.37 trillion, registering a CAGR of 7.5%.With the global rise in demand for natural gas, the most notable stocks in the natural gas industry are Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK), EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD). These three stocks have a TTM PE ratio lower than their peer average of 10.1x and also have a decent hedge fund sentiment according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds.Top 20 Natural Gas Producing Countries in the WorldPhoto by Max Bender on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe compiled a list of top natural gas-producing countries according to 2021 data provided by the US Energy Information Administration on the total volume of dry natural gas produced by each country in the year. We used 2021 data as a lot of countries have not provided their 2022 data yet. The countries are listed in ascending order of their annual production.Top 20 Natural Gas-Producing Countries in the World20. PakistanProduction in 2021: 1,179 billion cubic feetAccording to the US International Trade Administration, around 38% of Pakistan’s primary energy supply mix is covered by natural gas. It produces 4 billion cubic feet per day on average, compared to its demand of 6 to 8 billion cubic feet per day. According to the EIA, Pakistan has huge shale gas reserves but their potential is hard to reach due to geography, water scarcity, security issues, and low natural gas prices in the country.19. ThailandProduction in 2021: 1,284 billion cubic feetThailand is a hydrocarbon-producing country but due to its high energy demand, it is a net importer of oil and natural gas. In 2021, 75% of the country’s oil and gas needs were met through imports. Thailand has shown a downward trend in its natural gas production since 2019 and according to a 2021 Fitch Solutions report, the trend is going to continue through the decade.18. OmanProduction in 2021: 1,384 billion cubic feetOman is a major producer of oil and gas. In 2015, natural gas accounted for 35% of the country’s oil-gas mix. 17. ArgentinaProduction in 2021: 1,428 billion cubic feetAccording to the IEA, Argentina’s primary energy mix consists of 55% gas and 33% oil. The country has the second-largest shale gas reserves in its Patagonian south after the USA. Nevertheless, according to a Reuters report, the lack of fracking equipment can pose major problems for the country which desperately needs to add new pipelines.16. NigeriaProduction in 2021: 1,568 billion cubic feetNigeria has around 200 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. However, annually, gas production is significantly less, at 1,568 billion cubic feet in 2022. According to PWC, the country’s gas reserves hold the potential to add $18.3 billion to its gross economic value with around $4.2 billion covered by dry natural gas. However, due to security and financial challenges, Nigeria hasn’t reached its full potential yet.15. UzbekistanProduction in 2021: 1,755 billion cubic feetUzbekistan is a country rich in fossil fuels such as oil, gas, coal, and uranium. The country has been a big exporter of natural gas. However, in November 2022, its energy ministry announced that the country has reduced exports due to high demand for domestic use. In November 2022, the country’s daily exports decreased from over 353 million cubic feet per day to slightly over 35.3 million cubic feet per day.14. IndonesiaProduction in 2021: 2,082 billion cubic feetOver 60% of Indonesia’s natural gas production comes from its offshore fields. The four largest natural gas production fields in the country are in East Kalimantan, South Sumatra, North Sumatra, and the South Natuna Sea. Indonesia was the world’s 6th largest natural gas producer in 2000. However, over the years, the country has fallen several spots in terms of ranking.13. United Arab EmiratesProduction in 2021: 2,252 billion cubic feetAccording to the US International Trade Administration, 30% of UAE’s GDP and 13% of its exports are hydrocarbon-based. According to Mordor Intelligence, the country expects to increase its oil and gas production capacity with a CAGR of 2% between 2022 and 2027.Owing to the high demand for natural gas for domestic use, UAE is working on creating several artificial islands to produce natural gas. Together, these islands are expected to increase the country’s natural gas production capabilities by 3 billion cubic feet per day.12. EgyptProduction in 2021: 2,452 billion cubic feetEgypt is the largest natural gas producer in the Eastern Mediterranean region. According to the EIA, the country’s natural gas production picked up pace in 2017 with the opening of its Zohr field. In addition, in 2021, 87% of the natural gas produced by Egypt was used domestically.11. MalaysiaProduction in 2021: 2,507 billion cubic feetMalaysia is quite dependent on its fossil fuel exports. Before the pandemic in 2019, the industry accounted for over $34.5 billion in revenue, representing 14.5% of the country’s goods exported.In 2021, the country’s natural gas exports were worth $9.51 billion with Japan taking the largest share of those exports, followed by China and South Korea.10. TurkmenistanProduction in 2021: 3,073 billion cubic feetTurkmenistan has the world’s fourth-largest gas reserves but due to a lack of infrastructure and investments, the country hasn’t been producing natural gas to its full capacity. Moreover, Russia and Iran have been opposing the Trans-Caspian pipeline, which was supposed to connect to Europe. Nevertheless, Turkmenistan is the largest exporter to China. There are already three pipelines connected between the countries and Turkmenistan currently plans to build a fourth one to increase its exports to the country. 9. NorwayProduction in 2021: 4,066 billion cubic feetNorway has also recently received its 2022 natural gas production data, according to which, the country produced nearly 4372 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Moreover, due to the reduction in Russian gas imports in Europe in 2022, Norway’s natural gas exports were also significantly higher in 2022. The country exported over 4237 billion cubic feet in the year.8. Saudi ArabiaProduction in 2021: 4082 billion cubic feetAccording to our data taken from EIA, Saudi Arabia produced 4082 billion cubic feet of dry natural gas in 2021. Saudi Arabia’s new Jafurah project has the potential to be the crown jewel of the country’s natural gas production. The unconventional Jafurah gas field covers an area close to 6600 square miles and has estimated reserves of 200 trillion cubic feet.Saudi Aramco has begun its talks with equity investors to back a $110 billion investment in the field.7. AustraliaProduction in 2021: 5,196 billion cubic feetNatural gas was first discovered in Australia in 1890. Nearly 25% of the country’s energy needs are met by natural gas. In 2022, Australia’s liquified natural gas exports generated a revenue of $63.2 billion, representing an 86% year-over-year increase due to increased prices. The country exported around 81.4 million metric tonnes of LNG, up 0.5% from the previous year.6. QatarProduction in 2021: 5,968 billion cubic feetQatar is one of the biggest exporters of natural gas. In 2019, Qatar announced its plan to increase its natural gas production by 67% by 2027 to 126 million tons per annum (1 metric ton LNG = 48,700 cubic feet of natural gas).In 2021, Qatar started building 4 new production and export terminals and plans to build a couple more before 2030. Click to continue and see the Top 5 Natural Gas-Producing Countries in the World. Suggested Articles:25 Best Free PC Games of 2023Top 20 Women-Owned Companies in the US12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsDisclosure: None.

Pictured, Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern at Skift Global Forum on September 21, 2022 in Manhattan. Source: SkiftExpedia Group executives such as CEO Peter Kern and Chairman Barry Diller have long railed against Google’s inordinate dominance in travel advertising, but now Kern is hoping that the emergence of generative AI companies and other emerging technologies may lead to diminished dependence.“The travel world is governed by the funnel from Google, and all these potential ideas will potentially rebalance the market, which will be good,” Kern said in an interview published Friday with the Economic Times, the Indian business daily. “We all like to have less dependencies on one big tech player and spread it out to other big tech players. I think ultimately we want people to be direct consumers and have the [Expedia] app.”The interview touched on a variety of issues ranging from generative AI to the robust travel demand Expedia is seeing despite inflationary and other concerns.Expedia itself has been particularly active in emerging generative AI tech, having debuted last week an OpenAI ChatGPT-powered chatbot on the Expedia mobile app, and in March it became an OpenAI plug-in partner, along with Booking Holdings’ Kayak and OpenTable in the travel industry.The travel industry has long hoped for emerging players to take Google down a peg, and reduce the need to spend so much money with Google to win customers.While the emergence of OpenAI, a new crop of startups, and perhaps companies that don’t even exist today might make that happen, although disappointment has also been common.For example, by 2016 hotel chains such as  Marriott, Accor, Best Western, Wyndham, Choice, Hyatt, and Radisson, had signed on with Tripadvisor’s instant booking effort, which enabled their hotel bookings to take place on Tripadvisor without guests having to leave that website.If hotels could have counted on a stronger Tripadvisor to capture customers, then in theory they wouldn’t have had to spend so much advertising money on Google. Ultimately, Tripadvisor didn’t get the traction it sought with instant booking, and abandoned the initiative.Story continuesThe emergence of generative AI, which is taking place at what can be said to be an unprecedented pace in the tech world, is potentially way more far-reaching and platform-wrenching than the effort by a single company, Tripadvisor, to launch a booking feature. So the comparison has it flaws, but Kern’s hope that a reordering of the tech pecking order would be a consistent thread.Among rapid-fire changes taking place in search, the Bing app now enables voice-based search powered by OpenAI, and claims “this new language model is more powerful than ChatGPT and [is] customized for search.” Bing’s parent company Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI.But if Kern and others in the travel industry hope that the emergence of generative AI will lead to a rebalancing of power as it relates to Google in the tech platform world, it is way to early to dismiss Google’s efforts.Pundits almost unanimously count Google’s generative AI entry, Bard, as inferior to ChatGPT, but these are very early days, and Google has enormous tech resources to compete.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

We’re still well off the all-time highs in most stocks, but at the same time, the market has enjoyed a tremendous rally over the last three to six months. That’s got investors wondering what the best bargain stocks are at this point.Put simply, investors want to put money to work when there’s “blood in the street.” Or at least, that’s what they ought to do, given the long-term bullish nature of the stock market.At the same time, no one wants to get suckered into buying into the market right near an medium-term top.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite the big rally in the first quarter, there are still plenty of stocks trading at bargain levels. Let’s have a look at three such bargain stocks worth buying in April.PYPLPayPal$73.61JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$165.61BABAAlibaba$98.55PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquartersThere’s been a monstrous rally in tech, but almost no love for PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Shares have rallied about 13% from the 52-week low, trailing both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, as well as many of its peers.Put simply, PayPal stock has struggled for upside traction. That’s despite the company reporting several earnings beats in a row and raising its earnings outlook.Maybe the underperformance is because investors are no longer sure how to classify this stock.Previously considered a high-quality growth stock, the stock’s association with “growth” was its demise in 2022. PayPal suffered a peak-to-trough decline of more than 78%. Despite the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) falling a similar amount (81%), it’s currently up 33% from the lows.With its new lower-growth profile, PayPal stock is between a value stock and a growth stock. Indeed, I’d put it among the top bargain stocks in the market right now.Analysts now expect 7% to 10% annual revenue growth for the next few years, and steady earnings growth to boot. Despite this, shares trade at just 15-times this year’s earnings. That seems like a bargain for long-term investors.Story continuesJohnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comI have been pounding the table on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) lately, as the stock underwent an uncharacteristic decline. JNJ stock is normally known for its consistency and stability, but it has been anything but that over the last quarter.Over the past nine weeks, shares of JNJ stocks have fell for, well, nine straight weeks. Over that span, this stock fell more than 16%. Keep in mind, this was the company that provided reassurance to the public (and investors) in April 2020 amid the Covid-19 outbreak. It’s also the stock that was hitting all-time highs in April 2022 while many stocks were hitting 52-week lows.All of this is to say that Johnson &amp; Johnson’s selloff seems more like an opportunity for buyers than some profound ongoing collapse that will continue.Currently, JNJ stock pays a dividend yield close to 3% and has raised that dividend for 60 straight years. In April, it will go for 61 straight years. Analysts expect mid-single digit revenue growth this year and next year, but given the company’s consistency, 15-times earnings does not feel rich at all, making this selloff look like an opportunity.Alibaba (BABA)Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.Source: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.comFor many investors, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is simply not a name they are willing to entertain a long position in. Honestly, that’s quite fine. It’s a company that not many are directly familiar with, compared to a company like Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN), and many are aware of the risk it carries as a Chinese company.There is the constant worry about US-China relations, delisting worries in the U.S., and rolling crackdowns from the Chinese government. All of these concerns have led to a massive decline in BABA stock, which suffered a peak-to-trough decline of 81.8%.That said, if the Chinese economy comes roaring back to life and/or if hedge funds look to generate alpha in Chinese equities, they will most certainly head into Alibaba. If the company goes through with spinning off its businesses, this should create shareholder value, not erode it.The stock trades at roughly 12.5-times earnings, while being forecast to generate respectable growth this year.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. The electric power industry experienced a year full of challenges and opportunities in 2022. Despite the pandemic recovery, electricity sales in the US rose by 3.6% during the first eight months of the year compared to the previous year. However, the sector also faced increased costs due to natural gas prices more than doubling as a result of global shortages that were worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, extreme climate events such as droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, and wildfires continued to test the resilience of regional grids. As a response to these challenges, the industry and policymakers worked on improving reserves, deploying energy storage and microgrids, strengthening infrastructure, and enhancing flexible load options.It is expected that in 2023, the positive advancements seen in the electric power sector will continue to progress. However, the task of providing secure, reliable, affordable, and clean electricity could become more difficult due to various challenges. Elevated electricity prices may persist due to inflation, high fuel costs, and supply chain disruptions. Additionally, managing extreme weather, cybersecurity risks, and the growth of variable renewables and distributed energy resources may require innovative solutions to ensure grid reliability. Despite these challenges, new technologies and supportive policies could create opportunities in 2023 and aid the industry in achieving its objectives.Utilities are facing mounting pressure due to increasing expenses and rates, as well as growing regulatory scrutiny, changing customer expectations, and investor demands for consistent returns. To address these challenges, a technology-forward approach, expanding the use of operational technology, and digitizing the back office can benefit both the customer and the utility financially, while also creating more efficient operations. Story continuesAlthough distributed generation offers benefits such as energy independence for end customers, its widespread emergence on a distribution grid can create issues for electric utilities. Furthermore, the move towards a clean energy future adds pressure on utilities to find creative solutions for production and transmission. Full electrification will require a multi-pronged approach, including government funding, leveraging hydrogen and renewable natural gas, and utilizing a portfolio approach with multiple technologies to keep costs down and achieve net-zero goals. Similarly, the focus on decarbonization to address climate change and worsening air quality is driving acceleration in transportation and building electrification, investments in renewable energy, and new energy market participation. To benefit from the advancements and opportunities in the utilities sector, some of the best stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED), and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO). However, we discuss the best cheap utility stocks to invest in this article.

Sempra’s previously underappreciated portfolio of infrastructure assets, with existing as well as prospective liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities, should benefit from renewed interest in U.S.-sourced LNG. The U.S. commitment to increase LNG exports to Europe over the coming years should create a favorable long-term demand environment and hopefully regulatory framework benefiting Sempra along with other natural gas and LNG suppliers.

Approximately 70% of its revenue comes from Texas, where it owns one of the largest natural gas pipeline systems in the state.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Atmos Energy include:-Strong balance sheet and financial strength, perhaps most visible during 2021’s winter storm Uri when millions of Texans lost power. The significant spikes in natural gas prices stressed distributors, but Atmos handled over $2 billion of incremental costs with little long-term impact;-Experienced and shareholder-friendly management team, as demonstrated by 38 consecutive years of dividend increases; and-Attractive demographics and favorable regulatory environments in the states where it operates.Attractive ValuationGiven our estimates of higher normalized earnings and dividend payments, we believe shares of Atmos Energy are trading at a discount relative to our estimate of their intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Atmos Energy, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Old pipes and aging infrastructure, coupled with a growing population, have created a large backlog of safety and maintenance projects – completion of which should drive earnings growth and steady dividend increases. Updates should both increase reliability as well as the value of Atmos Energy’s assets, enhancing profit levels permitted by regulators;-Well positioned to source low-cost natural gas from prolific basins in Texas to its distribution network, helping to keep customer prices down and economically favorable relative to other sources of energy; and-Advantageous regulatory environment should continue to support rate adjustments so that revenues are earned on capital projects within six to 12 months.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.  Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Companies large and small continue to find ways to migrate to the digital realm that remains in the early stages of development. The firm Research and Markets forecasts that the metaverse could generate $700 billion of annual revenues for various companies by 2030, with those revenues growing about 40% a year between now and decade’s end. Many consumers also continue to believe strongly in the metaverse and its convergence with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital goods. Only a few weeks ago, it was reported that someone paid more than $100,000 for a pair of digital sneakers that can only be worn in the metaverse (more on that below). As the digital world continues to grow, we look at the three best metaverse stocks to buy for April 2023.METAMeta Platforms$216.10NVDANvidia$270.37NKENike$120.22Metaverse Stocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comAlthough it has scaled back the amount of money and resources it is putting into the metaverse, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) remains a leader when it comes to the development of the virtual realm. At the end of March, Nick Clegg, the head of global affairs at Meta Platforms, insisted that the future of computing will still take place within the metaverse. The company also has a lot of sunk costs in the virtual world, having spent $13.7 billion on its development in 2022.Additionally, the virtual reality headsets Meta Platforms has developed to help people gain access to the metaverse continue to sell well, though many people use them to play video games.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStill, the bottom line is that Meta Platforms is very involved with the metaverse, and it remains a top priority for the company that went so far as to completely rebrand itself to reflect its focus on the digital world. META stock has been a top performer this year, as it is up 80% since January.Story continuesNvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockSpeaking of tech stocks that have rebounded strongly this year, how about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)?  The semiconductor and microchip designer isn’t directly involved in the creation of the metaverse. However, its semis and chips are crucial components that make the virtual world possible. Without chips, the metaverse is not possible.This knowledge, coupled with the fact that Nvidia’s tech also powers artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, has the company’s share price up 85% so far this year.Nvidia most recently announced a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to develop a new metaverse platform for the Azure cloud computing platform. The company has also introduced a new server called “OVX 3” that is built to create and operate the metaverse.And Nvidia is also continuing to develop ever more advanced semiconductors and microchips that will help companies  realize their vision for the metaverse.Metaverse Stocks to Buy: Nike (NKE)A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.comYou might be thinking: “Why is a sneaker company mentioned in this article?” Nike (NYSE:NKE) is included because the athletic apparel company is doing more than just about any other firm to develop its brand and presence in the metaverse. Last fall, Nike announced that it was opening an online store and trading platform for virtual sneakers in the metaverse. Company executives also embarked on a six-city U.S. tour to educate consumers on web3, the metaverse and blockchain technology.Nike now has an entire design team dedicated to developing digital sneakers and other products for sale in the metaverse. It has also filed multiple trademarks for virtual goods and opened a virtual world on Roblox (NYSE:RBLX).Plus, Nike has purchased virtual sneaker creator RTFKT (pronounced ‘artifact’). Last year, NKE reported that it had earned nearly $200 million from the sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital products.This March, Nike sold a pair of NFT sneakers called “Cryptokicks” for $130,000. The person who purchased the sneakers can wear them (where else?) in the metaverse. NKE stock has risen 33% in the last six months.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in MSFT and NVDA.

Dominion asserts that Fox's top brass approved of the coverage, but the network says the evidence of high-level involvement is threadbare.Last week, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said he would not block Dominion from calling Rupert Murdoch, chairman of Fox News parent company Fox Corp, to testify in-person about his involvement in the coverage, which Davis has ruled was false and defamatory.""The more complicit the whole organization is in perpetuating these known falsehoods, the more likely a jury would be to return a big dollar figure,"" said Mary-Rose Papandrea, a constitutional law professor at the UNC School of Law.Dominion alleges that Fox destroyed its business by knowingly airing false claims that its ballot counting machines were used to flip the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election against former President Donald Trump, a Republican who lost to Democrat Joe Biden. The trial has been widely viewed as a test of whether Fox's coverage crossed the line between ethical journalism and the heedless pursuit of ratings, as Dominion alleges and Fox denies.The jury pool will be drawn from New Castle County, Delaware, where Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two-to-one, according to the state's Department of Elections. Fox is home to many conservative commentators who pulled for Trump.Opening arguments are set to begin April 17. They will come weeks after Davis dealt Fox a setback by ruling that claims the network aired about Dominion's complicity in a nonexistent plot to rig the election against Trump are not protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which forms the bedrock of free speech law.Story continuesBut Davis left it up for jurors to decide whether Fox knowingly spread false information or acted with reckless disregard for the truth - the legal standard of actual malice that Dominion must meet to prevail. The question could hinge upon troves of internal Fox communications and testimony by Murdoch, his son Lachlan, and a parade of Fox higher-ups and hosts who are expected to testify.The defamatory statements aired on shows including ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" ""Lou Dobbs Tonight"" and ""Justice with Judge Jeanine."" Dominion alleges that Fox personnel from the newsroom to the boardroom knew the statements were false but continued to air them to avoid losing viewers to far-right outlets. Dominion also cites evidence that some hosts and producers thought the guests spreading them, including former Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, were not credible.Fox has argued Dominion falls short of pinning actual malice on the individuals who were responsible for the defamatory statements because it cannot prove any ""superior officer"" at the network or its parent company ""ordered, participated in, or ratified"" wrongdoing. The network says scattered doubts about the claims among certain individuals cannot be attributed to the organization as a whole.""I think (Fox is) trying to argue that the employees themselves did not have that necessary mental state,"" said UNC's Papandrea. ""But it's tricky when the organization itself has relevant information that would cast doubt on the veracity of the statements about Dominion.""(Reporting by Helen Coster and Jack Queen in New York; Editing by Amy Stevens and Christopher Cushing)]"

Obviously, this subsegment is highly volatile and should only be approached with money you can afford to lose.Then again, these market ideas might save you a trip to Las Vegas if all you’re seeking is the rush of rolling the dice. For the hardened gambler, these are the speculative meme stocks that very well could make you rich.SNOWSnowflake$145.18CCChemours$28.26NOKNokia$4.87PYPLPayPal$74.71RAMPLiveRamp Holdings$23.23BODYBeachbody Company$0.50PLPlanet Labs$4.10InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSnowflake (SNOW)The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW IPO)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comA cloud computing-based data cloud enterprise, Montana-based Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) primarily offers data storage and analytics services. Generally termed as Data as a Service (DaaS), Snowflake allows corporate users to store and analyze data using cloud-based hardware and software. Since the beginning of the year, SNOW gained over 8% of equity value. However, in the trailing year, it’s down 31%.Of course, when talking about speculative meme stocks, sometimes printing red ink could be viewed as a positive. If anything, it allows fans to buy SNOW on the dip. Better yet, Snowflake provides some intriguing fiscal stats. For example, its cash-to-debt ratio pings at 15.93 times. In contrast, the sector median value sits at only 2.81 times.Another factor to consider is that for now, Snowflake represents a massive growth machine. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 80%, outpacing over 96% of sector players. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg SNOW as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes in at $184, implying nearly 26% upside potential.Chemours (CC)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comStory continuesAn American chemical company, Chemours (NYSE:CC) seems an odd choice for speculative meme stocks. However, I’ve learned to not question it and just report developments as they stand. Since the Jan. opener, CC declined by 6%. In the trailing one-year period, it gave up 10% of equity value. Notably, Chemours carries a forward yield of 3.48%, confirming that meme-traders don’t just target capital gains exclusively.Financially, the company offers several attractive attributes. Mainly, it prints a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 46.6%, outpacing 90.5% of companies in the chemicals industry. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the same period pings at 40.2%, above 83.18% of the field.Enticingly, the market prices CC at a forward multiple of 7.31. As a discount to projected earnings, Chemours ranks better than 89.24% of the competition. Lastly, covering analysts peg CC as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $38.91, implying over 35% upside potential.Nokia (NOK)a backdrop featuring the Nokia logo with a mobile phone featuring the Nokia logo on its screen in the foregroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comA fan favorite among speculative meme stocks, Finnish multinational telecommunications firm Nokia (NYSE:NOK) actually performed decently well this year. Since the Jan. opener, NOK gained over 4% of equity value. In the trailing year, it’s down a bit more than 9%. While not pleasant by any means, NOK hasn’t suffered the devastating losses incurred by similarly risky enterprises.Financially as well, I must say that Nokia cuts a relatively solid figure. Notably, its three-year EBITDA growth rate pings at 18.7%, outpacing 63.2% of the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 11.8%, above 68.82% of sector peers.Perhaps most attractive to participants of speculative meme stocks, the market prices NOK at a forward multiple of 10.52. As a discount to projected earnings, Nokia ranks better than 78.66% of the field. In closing, analysts peg NOK as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target is $7.05, implying nearly 44% upside potential.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comA popular financial technology (fintech) platform and business management ecosystem, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) offers significant relevancies. One area that should be particularly compelling is the gig economy. As workers question traditional mechanisms of earning income in the post-pandemic environment, PayPal might rise to greater levels of prominence. If so, PYPL would symbolize one of the top speculative meme stocks to consider.Not only that, the company’s financials largely offer an enticing picture. For starters, its cash-to-debt ratio comes in at 1.04 times. In contrast, the sector median value is only 0.28 times. Further, its debt-to-equity ratio sits favorably below 65.49% of companies listed in the credit services sector.Operationally, PayPal’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.7%, above 76.49% of its rivals. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period is 15.9%, beating out nearly 63% of competing enterprises. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $113.45, implying over 54% upside potential.LiveRamp (RAMP)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockBased in San Francisco, California, LiveRamp (NYSE:RAMP) bills itself as a data collaboration platform of choice for the world’s most innovative companies. According to LiveRamp’s website, the underlying practice allows companies to build enduring brands and business value. Still, RAMP is volatile. Since the Jan. opener, it dipped 4%. In the trailing one-year period, it fell nearly 41%.Still, astute contrarians should find RAMP attractive as one of the speculative meme stocks. Primarily, the underlying company benefits from fiscal stability. Particularly, its cash-to-debt ratio pings at 9.3 times, ranked better than 64.18% of its peers. Also, its Altman Z-Score is 5.74, indicating low risk of imminent bankruptcy.Operationally, LiveRamp’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 26.7%, beating out 82.15% of sector rivals. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period printed a very healthy 32.8%. Looking to the Street, analysts peg RAMP as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target stands at $35, implying over 54% upside potential.Beachbody (BODY)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Moving toward the extremely risky side of speculative meme stocks to consider, Beachbody (NYSE:BODY) is a fitness and media company. Per its public profile, it operates the brands Beachbody On Demand, Team Beachbody, MYXfitness and Openfit. As well, the enterprise sells dietary supplements through direct response infomercials and multi-level marketing programs.So far, BODY seems too risky for conservative investors to consider. Sure, it’s only down about 7% since the Jan. opener. However, in the past 365 days, BODY tanked over 74%. Further, its financial don’t provide much encouragement. Glaringly, its three-year revenue growth rate sits at 3.2% below parity. Also, its profit margins have sunk well below zero.On the positive side, I suppose you can say that BODY trades for 1.98-times tangible book value. For this metric, Beachbody ranks better than 63.87% of its peers. Finally, analysts peg BODY as a consensus hold. However, their average price target is $1.02, implying 106% upside potential.Planet Labs (PL)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAn Earth imaging company, the San Francisco-based Planet Labs (NYSE:PL) focuses on capturing the entirety of the Earth daily to monitor changes and pinpoint trends. One of the more immediately practical enterprises within the burgeoning space economy, PL could be intriguing for those seeking speculative meme stocks that may have longstanding relevance.Still, prospective investors must gird themselves for a bumpy ride. Since the Jan. opener, PL fell nearly 19%. And in the trailing one-year period, it gave up almost 34% of equity value. The red ink isn’t without justification. Notably, both the company’s long-term revenue trend and trailing-year net margin sit in negative territory.On the plus side, Planet Labs enjoys a decently stable balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio hits 18.56 times, better than 84.45% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg PL as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $8.33, implying nearly 128% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Inflation continues to remain hot, and the Federal Reserve is doing what it can to bring inflation down. That means higher interest rates, which depress valuations.Thus, stocks are getting hit across the board. For growth investors, this pain has been particularly acute.Now, 2023 has seen a rebound in certain sectors, including growth, and due to expectations a pause may be on the horizon. That said, a pause can only take place if we see some significant economic headwinds. Thus, a bet on lower rates is essentially a bet on a market crash, or at least a recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor those anticipating that a market crash (or maybe something less scary) is on the horizon, getting defensive is a great idea. These three stocks are among my top picks for investors looking to do so.Duke Energy (DUK)multiple powerline towers are shown against a sunset and a distant city skyline. AQN stockSource: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.comDuke Energy (NYSE:DUK), as its name would suggest, is an energy company that operates in two segments. The company provides both Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU&amp;I) and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GU&amp;I). Through producing, transmitting, distributing, and selling power, EU&amp;I serves retail consumers in the Southeast and Midwest areas of the United States. GU&amp;I serves natural gas customers, including wholesale customers served by municipalities, for residential, commercial, industrial, and power generation purposes.Warren Buffett’s personal portfolio includes Duke Energy, an electric utility company that offers high dividend yields. For most of the past decade, Duke Energy was overshadowed by growth stocks as investors preferred faster-growing companies that could take advantage of low lending rates. As a result, utility stocks with traditionally slow growth rates received little attention. However, with the possibility of a market crash, predictable utility stocks, particularly those with high dividend payouts, are gaining interest again.Story continuesAlthough the utility sector is generally considered unexciting when purchasing promising stocks, investors should keep an eye on Duke Energy. Like other utility companies, Duke Energy benefits from natural monopolies, which offer significant barriers to entry for competitors. This makes competition less of a concern for the company.Indeed, as far as defensive options are concerned, DUK stock is a great place for investors to start their search. This is a company I have on my radar right now.Restaurant Brands (QSR)Source: ShutterstockThree of the most recognizable food service companies worldwide are under the umbrella of Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR). This Canadian conglomerate includes world-class banners Burger King, Popeye’s, Tim Horton’s and Firehouse Subs. Thus, this lesser-known company is among the most prominent chain restaurants worldwide, with a market capitalization of roughly $30 billion.As with Duke Energy, Restaurant Brands benefits from any economic environment. The convenience and low-cost nature of the company’s fast food products means that in times of turmoil, diners will often trade down to Restaurant Brands’ offerings. Accordingly, the company’s strong financial performance in good times and bad makes this company a particular gem to consider right now. Indeed, I believe Restaurant Brands is one of the best-positioned companies to withstand a market meltdown.The company’s recent financial results offer a compelling case. In the previous year’s fourth quarter, Restaurant Brands displayed a strong performance in all areas, with 12% year-over-year growth in system-wide sales. This data highlights the company’s impressive financial standing and makes it an attractive option for potential investors seeking a profitable opportunity.If we avoid a recession, QSR stock and its 3.3% yield certainly seem to provide total return upside worth considering. However, if the market turns sour, this stock could quietly outperform. That’s the kind of holding I like right now, and the reason this is my biggest position.McCormick’s (MKC)On a white table sits bowls of nuts, fruit, and seeds, while vegetables like brocolli, carrots, and mushrooms sit on the tableSource: Tatjana Baibakova / ShutterstockMcCormick’s (NYSE:MKC) stock may experience a potential upswing shortly. The spice producer recently announced price hikes, and despite some resistance, this move could lead to increased earnings for the company. Over the past few years, McCormick has experienced a slight decline in revenues, and implementing these price hikes could help turn the tide. As a result, it’s worth considering investing in McCormick’s stock now, as this decision may pay off down the line.MKC stock may see appreciation, if the company is able to pass on inflation-related costs to consumers. Given the quality of McCormick’s brands, I think this is more than likely. The company has demonstrated strong pricing power; something investors should be watchful for right now.Additionally, although MKC only yields 2.2%, its payouts have increased by 9.4% over the last five years. As a result, investors looking for consistent dividend growth rather than immediate profit should consider investing in MKC shares.In its latest quarter, the manufacturer of cooking spices and herbs, and well-known brands such as Old Bay, French’s, Frank’s RedHot, and Grill Mates, surpassed analysts’ predictions. McCormick attributed its successful quarter to a diverse global range of products and a well-balanced approach between consumer and commercial customers. The company’s solid performance indicates its ability to effectively navigate and thrive in today’s competitive market.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in QSR. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at WestRock’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for WestRock Is WestRock Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 9.48x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 12.52x, which means if you buy WestRock today, you’d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe that WestRock should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because WestRock’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will WestRock generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 33% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for WestRock. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? WRK’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at WRK? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on WRK, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for WRK, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

70,1e9983af-33f1-33fd-a6da-83873f0289cf,ADI,2023-04-10,"Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) Is Going Strong But Fundamentals Appear To Be Mixed : Is There A Clear Direction For The Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-120036239.html,1681041636,STORY,['ADI'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Analog Devices' (NASDAQ:ADI) stock increased significantly by 12% over the past three months. But the company's key financial indicators appear to be differing across the board and that makes us question whether or not the company's current share price momentum can be maintained. In this article, we decided to focus on Analog Devices'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:9.4% = US$3.4b ÷ US$37b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Analog Devices' Earnings Growth And 9.4% ROEOn the face of it, Analog Devices' ROE is not much to talk about. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 18%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Although, we can see that Analog Devices saw a modest net income growth of 15% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesWe then compared Analog Devices' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 27% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Analog Devices''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Analog Devices Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 75% (or a retention ratio of 25%) for Analog Devices suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Moreover, Analog Devices is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 37% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 15% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we have mixed feelings about Analog Devices. While the company has posted a decent earnings growth, We do feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings at a higher rate of return. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Verizon CommunicationsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Tamara Erwin, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$49.77 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$39.48). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Tamara Erwin was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.03% of Verizon Communications shares, worth about US$43m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Do The Verizon Communications Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Verizon Communications shares in the last quarter. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Verizon Communications insiders. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Verizon Communications. While conducting our analysis, we found that Verizon Communications has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on NVIDIA is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$5.6b ÷ (US$41b - US$6.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).So, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 16%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 14% generated by the Semiconductor industry. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA roceIn the above chart we have measured NVIDIA's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at NVIDIA doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 16% from 32% five years ago. However it looks like NVIDIA might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom LineBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by NVIDIA's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 372% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.If you want to continue researching NVIDIA, you might be interested to know about the 3 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Dominion asserts that Fox's top brass approved of the coverage, but the network says the evidence of high-level involvement is threadbare.Last week, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said he would not block Dominion from calling Rupert Murdoch, chairman of Fox News parent company Fox Corp, to testify in-person about his involvement in the coverage, which Davis has ruled was false and defamatory.""The more complicit the whole organization is in perpetuating these known falsehoods, the more likely a jury would be to return a big dollar figure,"" said Mary-Rose Papandrea, a constitutional law professor at the UNC School of Law.Dominion alleges that Fox destroyed its business by knowingly airing false claims that its ballot counting machines were used to flip the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election against former President Donald Trump, a Republican who lost to Democrat Joe Biden. The trial has been widely viewed as a test of whether Fox's coverage crossed the line between ethical journalism and the heedless pursuit of ratings, as Dominion alleges and Fox denies.The jury pool will be drawn from New Castle County, Delaware, where Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two-to-one, according to the state's Department of Elections. Fox is home to many conservative commentators who pulled for Trump.Opening arguments are set to begin April 17. They will come weeks after Davis dealt Fox a setback by ruling that claims the network aired about Dominion's complicity in a nonexistent plot to rig the election against Trump are not protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which forms the bedrock of free speech law.Story continuesBut Davis left it up for jurors to decide whether Fox knowingly spread false information or acted with reckless disregard for the truth - the legal standard of actual malice that Dominion must meet to prevail. The question could hinge upon troves of internal Fox communications and testimony by Murdoch, his son Lachlan, and a parade of Fox higher-ups and hosts who are expected to testify.The defamatory statements aired on shows including ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" ""Lou Dobbs Tonight"" and ""Justice with Judge Jeanine."" Dominion alleges that Fox personnel from the newsroom to the boardroom knew the statements were false but continued to air them to avoid losing viewers to far-right outlets. Dominion also cites evidence that some hosts and producers thought the guests spreading them, including former Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, were not credible.Fox has argued Dominion falls short of pinning actual malice on the individuals who were responsible for the defamatory statements because it cannot prove any ""superior officer"" at the network or its parent company ""ordered, participated in, or ratified"" wrongdoing. The network says scattered doubts about the claims among certain individuals cannot be attributed to the organization as a whole.""I think (Fox is) trying to argue that the employees themselves did not have that necessary mental state,"" said UNC's Papandrea. ""But it's tricky when the organization itself has relevant information that would cast doubt on the veracity of the statements about Dominion.""(Reporting by Helen Coster and Jack Queen in New York; Editing by Amy Stevens and Christopher Cushing)]"

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 64% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Walt Disney, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walt Disney?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Walt Disney does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Walt Disney, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Walt Disney. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.0% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.9% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Walt DisneyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Walt Disney Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$48m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 36% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Walt Disney. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Walt Disney better, we need to consider many other factors.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. The electric power industry experienced a year full of challenges and opportunities in 2022. Despite the pandemic recovery, electricity sales in the US rose by 3.6% during the first eight months of the year compared to the previous year. However, the sector also faced increased costs due to natural gas prices more than doubling as a result of global shortages that were worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, extreme climate events such as droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, and wildfires continued to test the resilience of regional grids. As a response to these challenges, the industry and policymakers worked on improving reserves, deploying energy storage and microgrids, strengthening infrastructure, and enhancing flexible load options.It is expected that in 2023, the positive advancements seen in the electric power sector will continue to progress. However, the task of providing secure, reliable, affordable, and clean electricity could become more difficult due to various challenges. Elevated electricity prices may persist due to inflation, high fuel costs, and supply chain disruptions. Additionally, managing extreme weather, cybersecurity risks, and the growth of variable renewables and distributed energy resources may require innovative solutions to ensure grid reliability. Despite these challenges, new technologies and supportive policies could create opportunities in 2023 and aid the industry in achieving its objectives.Utilities are facing mounting pressure due to increasing expenses and rates, as well as growing regulatory scrutiny, changing customer expectations, and investor demands for consistent returns. To address these challenges, a technology-forward approach, expanding the use of operational technology, and digitizing the back office can benefit both the customer and the utility financially, while also creating more efficient operations. Story continuesAlthough distributed generation offers benefits such as energy independence for end customers, its widespread emergence on a distribution grid can create issues for electric utilities. Furthermore, the move towards a clean energy future adds pressure on utilities to find creative solutions for production and transmission. Full electrification will require a multi-pronged approach, including government funding, leveraging hydrogen and renewable natural gas, and utilizing a portfolio approach with multiple technologies to keep costs down and achieve net-zero goals. Similarly, the focus on decarbonization to address climate change and worsening air quality is driving acceleration in transportation and building electrification, investments in renewable energy, and new energy market participation. To benefit from the advancements and opportunities in the utilities sector, some of the best stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED), and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO). However, we discuss the best cheap utility stocks to invest in this article.

The conflict and economic sanctions against Russia have brought to the forefront EU dependence on Russian oil and natural gas. As Germany and its EU neighbors look to diversify their natural gas suppliers, some U.S. companies stand to benefit. Within the portfolio, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is well-positioned. Sempra’s previously underappreciated portfolio of infrastructure assets, with existing as well as prospective liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities, should benefit from renewed interest in U.S.-sourced LNG. The U.S. commitment to increase LNG exports to Europe over the coming years should create a favorable long-term demand environment and hopefully regulatory framework benefiting Sempra along with other natural gas and LNG suppliers. Sempra’s core utilities operations in California and Texas continue to generate solid mid- to high-single-digit earnings growth, and it enjoys additional growth opportunities from renewable natural gas (RNG), hydrogen and other renewable sources of energy.”6.

Approximately 70% of its revenue comes from Texas, where it owns one of the largest natural gas pipeline systems in the state.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Atmos Energy include:-Strong balance sheet and financial strength, perhaps most visible during 2021’s winter storm Uri when millions of Texans lost power. The significant spikes in natural gas prices stressed distributors, but Atmos handled over $2 billion of incremental costs with little long-term impact;-Experienced and shareholder-friendly management team, as demonstrated by 38 consecutive years of dividend increases; and-Attractive demographics and favorable regulatory environments in the states where it operates.Attractive ValuationGiven our estimates of higher normalized earnings and dividend payments, we believe shares of Atmos Energy are trading at a discount relative to our estimate of their intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Atmos Energy, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Old pipes and aging infrastructure, coupled with a growing population, have created a large backlog of safety and maintenance projects – completion of which should drive earnings growth and steady dividend increases. Updates should both increase reliability as well as the value of Atmos Energy’s assets, enhancing profit levels permitted by regulators;-Well positioned to source low-cost natural gas from prolific basins in Texas to its distribution network, helping to keep customer prices down and economically favorable relative to other sources of energy; and-Advantageous regulatory environment should continue to support rate adjustments so that revenues are earned on capital projects within six to 12 months.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.  Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on ONEOK is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$2.7b ÷ (US$24b - US$3.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, ONEOK has an ROCE of 13%.  In isolation, that's a pretty standard return but against the Oil and Gas industry average of 21%, it's not as good. View our latest analysis for ONEOK roceIn the above chart we have measured ONEOK's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?ONEOK is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 13%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 50%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at ONEOK thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.What We Can Learn From ONEOK's ROCEAll in all, it's terrific to see that ONEOK is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And with a respectable 59% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesIf you want to know some of the risks facing ONEOK we've found 2 warning signs (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.While ONEOK may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Thus far, 2023 has not played out well for investors in this sector, with energy stocks falling 4.23%, based on the S&amp;P Global 1200 Energy index. Those negative returns contrast poorly with the broader S&amp;P 500, which has risen 7.5% year-to-date, at the time of writing.Nevertheless, there have been outliers among energy stocks that have bucked the trend, producing solid returns. BP (NYSE:BP) and Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) among their ranks.However, this list focuses on the underperformers, particularly specific energy stocks investors should be looking to sell. Now is the time to rotate out of these companies, and into better-performing energy stocks or other sectors, including tech.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCHKChesapeake Energy$75.28DVNDevon Energy$52.91COPConocoPhillips$106.26Chesapeake Energy (CHK)Image of an internet browser with Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) homepage on it. The Chesapeake Energy logo on the page is amplified by a magnifying glass.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comChesapeake Energy (NASDAQ:CHK) was a solid stock to have held in 2022. Like many energy stocks, it had a strong year due to booming energy prices. The company deals primarily in natural gas, which soared last year. This led to a more than doubling of revenues in 2022, reaching $11.74 billion.That strong performance resulted in CHK stock increasing from $66 to $94 in 2022. Of course, 2023 has begun as an entirely different story. CHK stock has since declined to around $75 per share, at the time of writing.The company’s forecasted production volume, as well as expected energy prices, are not in Chesapeake’s favor right now. In short, 2023 will not be a repeat of 2022, which suggests investors should avoid CHK stock, or sell now.The company provided guidance that 2023 production volume will likely be lower than 2022, when it released earnings in February. And the U.S. Energy Information Administration has forecast lower prices throughout 2023.Story continuesThose aren’t the only two factors that determine Chesapeake’s share prices, to be sure. However, they are critical factors nonetheless. The company won’t produce 2022-level revenues in 2023, which is a simple reason to avoid CHK stock now.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) had a great 2022, just as Chesapeake Energy and many other energy companies did. High-level metrics suggest DVN stock is investment grade, something the company has called itself in the past.Devon’s free cash flows more than doubled in 2022, reaching $6 billion. Additionally, the company’s Q4 oil production volumes reached an all-time high of 316,000 barrels per day. And for shareholders, its already-high dividend was raised by 11% in 2023.These strong results make it difficult to understand why Devon Energy has seen declining share prices in 2023. But it’s a case of past performance not guaranteeing future returns. Devon Energy’s issue is weak 2023 production expectations paired with higher-than-expected capital expenditures. If a given company’s income is expected to fall while its expenses rise, it will be more vulnerable. That’s where Devon Energy is currently due to those combined factors.Devon’s 10% dividend is very enticing, but investors should remain cautious. Such high yields tend to indicate significantly higher risk, which the market is clearly pricing into this stock now.ConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comThe fortunes of ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and those of its shareholders, have not been strong this year. In 2023, COP stock has been among the many energy stocks that have witnessed a drop. Much of that decline can be attributed to news surrounding the company’s Willow Project on Alaska’s North Slope.That project has faced significant scrutiny, culminating in an environmental review by the Biden Administration. The Interior Department was tasked with deciding whether to allow drilling, issuing its Record of Decision on 13 March.That decision rejected two of ConocoPhillips’ five proposed drill sites, reducing and its overall footprint by 40%. COP stock fell immediately following the announcement of the decision. Even before the decision was announced, there was speculation about a scaled-down decision. Those rumors also suggested that the project’s economic feasibility was in doubt under such a scenario.Time will tell what the financial results of the project are. However, a less-than-ideal outcome has materialized for ConocoPhillips. That’s a solid sign to avoid COP stock for now.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The tech sector has not only survived but also thrived despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic in recent years. The crisis has forced many companies to adopt new digital strategies and drastically alter their work models, propelling them into the future. On March 15, CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa noted that long-term investors in the tech space are looking for safety. She observed that well-capitalized companies have outperformed their smaller counterparts in the tech industry. In the Software segment, Bosa pointed out that Smartsheet Inc. (NYSE:SMAR) and SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) are ""solid recurring revenue plays"". However, she admitted that the financing landscape in the technology sector has rapidly declined, especially after the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank. The tech space is yet to see how Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)'s acquisition of Figma and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) will play out, but Bosa told investors that Wall Street is on board with Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s brutal layoffs, given that core growth is the main focus for now. The current focus of businesses is not solely on expanding their operations, but on maximizing profits, retaining customers, and improving efficiency. The implementation of strategies like staff reductions and redirecting resources towards core business areas are indications of this change. As a result, software and tech companies will strive to reduce costs by cutting back on expensive marketing, increasing automation, and reducing the number of special offers for new customers. According to Statisa.com, the software market is estimated to generate a revenue of $659 billion by 2023, with Enterprise Software being the largest segment, projected to reach a market volume of $271.80 billion during the same period. The market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 5.42% between 2023 and 2028, leading to a market volume of $858.10 billion by 2028. The United States is anticipated to generate the highest revenue among all countries, with an estimated revenue of $338.20 billion in 2023.Story continuesThe technology industry is exploring new avenues for generating revenue by venturing into the healthcare sector, utilizing digital innovations to facilitate innovation and change. In addition, these companies are endeavoring to employ technologies like 5G, AI, and edge computing to revolutionize other sectors such as manufacturing, real estate, and retail.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. The electric power industry experienced a year full of challenges and opportunities in 2022. Despite the pandemic recovery, electricity sales in the US rose by 3.6% during the first eight months of the year compared to the previous year. However, the sector also faced increased costs due to natural gas prices more than doubling as a result of global shortages that were worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, extreme climate events such as droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, and wildfires continued to test the resilience of regional grids. As a response to these challenges, the industry and policymakers worked on improving reserves, deploying energy storage and microgrids, strengthening infrastructure, and enhancing flexible load options.It is expected that in 2023, the positive advancements seen in the electric power sector will continue to progress. However, the task of providing secure, reliable, affordable, and clean electricity could become more difficult due to various challenges. Elevated electricity prices may persist due to inflation, high fuel costs, and supply chain disruptions. Additionally, managing extreme weather, cybersecurity risks, and the growth of variable renewables and distributed energy resources may require innovative solutions to ensure grid reliability. Despite these challenges, new technologies and supportive policies could create opportunities in 2023 and aid the industry in achieving its objectives.Utilities are facing mounting pressure due to increasing expenses and rates, as well as growing regulatory scrutiny, changing customer expectations, and investor demands for consistent returns. To address these challenges, a technology-forward approach, expanding the use of operational technology, and digitizing the back office can benefit both the customer and the utility financially, while also creating more efficient operations. Story continuesAlthough distributed generation offers benefits such as energy independence for end customers, its widespread emergence on a distribution grid can create issues for electric utilities. Furthermore, the move towards a clean energy future adds pressure on utilities to find creative solutions for production and transmission. Full electrification will require a multi-pronged approach, including government funding, leveraging hydrogen and renewable natural gas, and utilizing a portfolio approach with multiple technologies to keep costs down and achieve net-zero goals. Similarly, the focus on decarbonization to address climate change and worsening air quality is driving acceleration in transportation and building electrification, investments in renewable energy, and new energy market participation. To benefit from the advancements and opportunities in the utilities sector, some of the best stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED), and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO). However, we discuss the best cheap utility stocks to invest in this article.

Updates should both increase reliability as well as the value of Atmos Energy’s assets, enhancing profit levels permitted by regulators;-Well positioned to source low-cost natural gas from prolific basins in Texas to its distribution network, helping to keep customer prices down and economically favorable relative to other sources of energy; and-Advantageous regulatory environment should continue to support rate adjustments so that revenues are earned on capital projects within six to 12 months.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.  Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Boston Scientific Boston Scientific Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Eric Francis Thepaut, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$848k worth of shares at a price of US$40.99 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$50.08. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 22% of Eric Francis Thepaut's holding.In the last year Boston Scientific insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Boston Scientific Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Boston Scientific. In total, Executive VP and Group President of MedSurg &amp; Asia Pacific Arthur C. Butcher sold US$583k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Boston Scientific insiders own about US$175m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Boston Scientific Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Boston Scientific. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Boston Scientific (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable) you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Paired with the skyrocketing cost of housing, limited availability of affordable homes, and increasingly severe and disruptive weather events, many individuals and families around the world are faced with impossible living situations. When natural or man-made disaster strikes, often homes are damaged or destroyed, which can result in especially tragic outcomes for low-income households with limited means to handle extensive and costly repairs or rebuilding.Changing weather patterns also impact how we live within our homes. According to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, the average U.S. household spends nearly $2,000 annually on energy bills, which leads to more greenhouse gas emissions and further climate change. Exorbitant energy-bills or expensive maintenance costs can leave low-income households even more cost burdened, forcing them to forgo necessities like food or medicine to maintain power or heat. They may also keep their homes at unsafe or unhealthy temperatures. A 2020 analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration found that 34 million U.S. households faced energy insecurity. Rising energy costs contribute to the financial burden that comes with housing, making affordable housing unattainable for far too many families. As climate change continues to affect weather and intensify disasters, the need for sustainable building practices and climate-resilient homes is becoming increasingly apparent.At Habitat for Humanity, we know that affordable housing and sustainability go hand in hand. From reducing utility bills through energy-efficient homes to using conscientious building practices, we're continuously exploring ways to build our homes to benefit families and the environment. With the support of partners like Whirlpool Corporation, we are doing that and much more.Story continuesThrough the BuildBetter with Whirlpool initiative, Habitat and Whirlpool are actively creating ways to help homeowners mitigate the impacts of climate change. We are building homes that are disaster-resilient and can withstand increasingly severe weather events. We are building homes that are energy-efficient and incorporate features such as solar panels, water-conserving plumbing fixtures, and high-efficiency heating and cooling. And we are building homes at code-plus standards. These measures provide Habitat homeowners the potential to not only save on monthly utility bills, but also the opportunity to live in healthier, more resilient homes. Whirlpool and Habitat have 143 homes in progress through the initiative, which began in June 2021.During our 22-year partnership, we have made profound impact on the lives of families around the world. Home is so much more than four walls and a roof; it is a sanctuary, a place to make memories, a place for children to grow up healthy and strong.Whirlpool Corp.'s House + Home initiative reflects their commitment of building homes and improving the communities they serve, while helping families secure brighter, stronger, and healthier futures.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. The electric power industry experienced a year full of challenges and opportunities in 2022. Despite the pandemic recovery, electricity sales in the US rose by 3.6% during the first eight months of the year compared to the previous year. However, the sector also faced increased costs due to natural gas prices more than doubling as a result of global shortages that were worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, extreme climate events such as droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, and wildfires continued to test the resilience of regional grids. As a response to these challenges, the industry and policymakers worked on improving reserves, deploying energy storage and microgrids, strengthening infrastructure, and enhancing flexible load options.It is expected that in 2023, the positive advancements seen in the electric power sector will continue to progress. However, the task of providing secure, reliable, affordable, and clean electricity could become more difficult due to various challenges. Elevated electricity prices may persist due to inflation, high fuel costs, and supply chain disruptions. Additionally, managing extreme weather, cybersecurity risks, and the growth of variable renewables and distributed energy resources may require innovative solutions to ensure grid reliability. Despite these challenges, new technologies and supportive policies could create opportunities in 2023 and aid the industry in achieving its objectives.Utilities are facing mounting pressure due to increasing expenses and rates, as well as growing regulatory scrutiny, changing customer expectations, and investor demands for consistent returns. To address these challenges, a technology-forward approach, expanding the use of operational technology, and digitizing the back office can benefit both the customer and the utility financially, while also creating more efficient operations. Story continuesAlthough distributed generation offers benefits such as energy independence for end customers, its widespread emergence on a distribution grid can create issues for electric utilities. Furthermore, the move towards a clean energy future adds pressure on utilities to find creative solutions for production and transmission. Full electrification will require a multi-pronged approach, including government funding, leveraging hydrogen and renewable natural gas, and utilizing a portfolio approach with multiple technologies to keep costs down and achieve net-zero goals. Similarly, the focus on decarbonization to address climate change and worsening air quality is driving acceleration in transportation and building electrification, investments in renewable energy, and new energy market participation. To benefit from the advancements and opportunities in the utilities sector, some of the best stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED), and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO). However, we discuss the best cheap utility stocks to invest in this article.

Sempra’s previously underappreciated portfolio of infrastructure assets, with existing as well as prospective liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities, should benefit from renewed interest in U.S.-sourced LNG.

(NYSE:ED), and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO), Atmos Energy Corporation (NYSE:ATO) is one of the top utility stocks to watch. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Value Equity has to say about Atmos Energy Corporation (NYSE:ATO) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: “Headquartered in Dallas, Atmos Energy is the largest fully regulated natural gas-only utility in the U.S. It serves over three million distribution customers across eight states, primarily in the South. Approximately 70% of its revenue comes from Texas, where it owns one of the largest natural gas pipeline systems in the state.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Atmos Energy include:-Strong balance sheet and financial strength, perhaps most visible during 2021’s winter storm Uri when millions of Texans lost power. The significant spikes in natural gas prices stressed distributors, but Atmos handled over $2 billion of incremental costs with little long-term impact;-Experienced and shareholder-friendly management team, as demonstrated by 38 consecutive years of dividend increases; and-Attractive demographics and favorable regulatory environments in the states where it operates.Attractive ValuationGiven our estimates of higher normalized earnings and dividend payments, we believe shares of Atmos Energy are trading at a discount relative to our estimate of their intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Atmos Energy, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Old pipes and aging infrastructure, coupled with a growing population, have created a large backlog of safety and maintenance projects – completion of which should drive earnings growth and steady dividend increases. Updates should both increase reliability as well as the value of Atmos Energy’s assets, enhancing profit levels permitted by regulators;-Well positioned to source low-cost natural gas from prolific basins in Texas to its distribution network, helping to keep customer prices down and economically favorable relative to other sources of energy; and-Advantageous regulatory environment should continue to support rate adjustments so that revenues are earned on capital projects within six to 12 months.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.  Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

102,74e75c90-5e19-380d-88f4-d79856afe421,GE,2023-04-10,"With 72% ownership of the shares, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/72-ownership-shares-general-electric-130021436.html,1681045221,STORY,['GE'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, General Electric's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 12 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownershipUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyTo get a sense of who is truly in control of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 72% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of General Electric. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that General Electric does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at General Electric's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in General Electric. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.0% and 6.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of General Electric Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$253m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  General Electric is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

103,182e8cc1-2aed-309d-a9da-63950e2210e1,VLO,2023-04-10,7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for April 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-rated-stocks-buy-april-113034390.html,1680867034,STORY,"['VLO', 'ARDX', 'TJX', 'DGII', 'BP', 'CPRX', 'AEHR']","[The first quarter’s in the books, and happily, the stock market is having a much better year than we endured in 2022. If you’re an investor looking for stocks to buy, you’re probably feeling pretty good about your chances for a good April.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1% for the year but has been building much-needed momentum over the last several weeks. The S&amp;P 500 is up 6% in 2023, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shows a 14% gain.But this isn’t the time to stand pat. The world’s still spinning, and market conditions change rapidly. OPEC announced that it’s cutting production, which will directly affect oil prices. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates and battle high inflation, and Congress and President Biden are wrestling with the debt ceiling, setting up a showdown that could significantly impact the economy.I’ve used my Portfolio Grader to identify the best stocks to buy in April as we launch into the year’s second quarter. The Portfolio Grader evaluates and grades stocks to buy based on performance, earnings history, momentum, analyst sentiment and quantitative measurements. It assigns a grade from “A” to “F” to each name – and just like in school, you want to be shooting for straight As on your report card.Here are seven A-rated stocks to buy for April to keep your portfolio in top-notch shape.VLOValero Energy $133.29BPBP $39.71DGIIDigi International $32.72AEHRAehr Test Systems $28.07ARDXArdelyx $4.40CPRXCatalyst Pharmaceuticals $17.22TJXTJX Companies $78.14Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is a downstream oil and gas company that is the world’s largest producer of renewable fuels. Valero’s ethanol plants can produce dry distillers’ grains, ethanol and corn oil for gasoline blenders and refiners.Story continuesRenewable energy is a coveted space that becomes more appealing with OPEC’s production cuts and the rising oil price. The global ethanol market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.8% through 2027, reaching $129.3 billion.Valero reported fourth-quarter earnings of $41.75 billion, that was 17.5% better than a year ago. While it narrowly missed analysts’ revenue estimates, the company showed solid profits by posting earnings per share of $8.45, which was better than analysts’ expectations of $7.25.VLO stock is up 25% over the last 12 months and provides a 3% dividend yield, which is a nice perk all by itself. VLO has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader and it one of the better stocks to buy on oil price increases.BP (BP)BP stock: the BP company logo on a buildingSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com BP (NYSE:BP) is in a prominent position to profit from higher oil and gas prices. It’s already coming off its most profitable year, banking $27.7 billion in 2022 (compared to $12.8 billion in 2021). It also is in a prime position to continue profiting from the European energy market, which sees tight supply because Russia invaded Ukraine and Moscow’s subsequent cuts of natural gas to the West.BP is also expected to complete its TravelCenters of America (NYSE:TA) acquisition by mid-year. The $1.3 billion deal will give BP an additional 281 fuel stations in 44 U.S. states and another opportunity to capitalize on rising oil prices, making it one of the best multi-stream stocks to buy.BP has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Digi International (DGII)5G digital hologram floating over a phone on a city background. representing 5g stocks investing for the next decadeSource: Fit Ztudio / Shutterstock.comDigi International (NASDAQ:DGII) is a Minnesota-based company that develops products and solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT). Digi’s products and services support retail, banking, medical and transportation industries, helping them create next-generation connected products and manage infrastructure.Digi has been a consistent winner on Wall Street, with earnings for the fiscal first quarter 2023 (ending Dec. 31, 2022) coming in at $109.3 million, or 29.7% better than the previous year. Digi is projecting fiscal Q2 revenue to be $105 million to $109 million, with analysts’ consensus estimates at $104.5 million. It’s one of the more interesting stocks to buy in the sector.DGII stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Aehr Test Systems (AEHR)Illustration of an electric car charging outside of a city with wind turbines in the background; EVSource: petovarga / ShutterstockI consider Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) a calculated gamble, even with its “A” rating, but it’s still worth your attention because it has massive potential.Aehr makes the burn-in equipment in silicon carbine chips commonly found in electric vehicles. EVs are a growing market with tremendous upside: a compound annual growth rate of 17% through 2027 and a projected market of $858 billion. Each EV requires thousands of semiconductors, making Aehr’s services valuable.The problem is that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced it’s come up with a new power inverter that cuts reliance on silicon carbide. The announcement sent AEHR stock down 8% in a single day, but Aehr’s executives say its market won’t be impacted.That remains to be seen.Aehr posted fiscal third-quarter revenue of $17.2 million and earnings of 16 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $16 million and 14 cents per share. It also reiterated its guidance for the full fiscal year ending May 31 with sales between $60 million to $70 million. But its implied sales goal for the current quarter is $22.3 million, below the $23.6 million that Wall Street expects. That sent AEHR stock down 25% since April 1.Tesla’s new power inverter won’t be included on its vehicles until the next model platform, which is still in development. So I’m banking on Aehr to hit its revenue goals, at least, and churn out a solid return at a suddenly discounted price. AEHR stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Ardelyx (ARDX)Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.Source: Billion Photos / ShutterstockI won’t blame you if Ardelyx (NASDAQ:ARDX) isn’t on your radar right now. It’s a penny stock – for now – with a market capitalization of only $931 million.But it’s probably time to pay attention to this one.Based in Waltham, Massachusetts, Ardelyx is a rising pharmaceutical company. The company is glowing from its successful launch of Ibsrela, the brand name for tenapanor, used to treat irritable bowel syndrome.What’s exciting about this development, however, is that Ardelyx has paperwork before the Food and Drug Administration to use tenapanor to treat patients on dialysis with chronic kidney disease. Ardelyx would see projected sales of $800 million in five years if granted.Ardelyx won’t stay under the radar for long – shares are already up 55% this year. Happily, analysts are putting a consensus price target of $7.59 on ARDX stock, meaning it still has a 71% runway.You have time to get on board, but this bandwagon isn’t sticking around. ARDX stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comCatalyst Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CPRX) is at the forefront of developing medications to treat the aging population. Its top drug is Firdapse, which treats adults with Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, a rare condition that affects signals sent from nerves to muscles, making them unable to contract properly.Firdapse sales account for the company’s entire revenue stream, which was $61 million in Q4 (up 58% from a year ago).Catalyst is another company discounted severely right now because it faced some bad news. In late January, Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) announced plans for a generic version of Firdapse, and that news sent CPRX stock down 27%. Catalyst is working on a label expansion for Firdapse and purchasing U.S. rights to an epilepsy treatment developed by Eisai (OTCMKTS:ESAIY).For now, however, Catalyst is projecting continued growth. Its issued guidance for full-year 2023 revenue between $375 million and $385 million, which is well above the consensus analysts’ estimate of $337.6 million.As far as April goes, I think Catalyst remains a solid pick, and many agree. Shares have already rebounded 14% since bottoming out in January, and I expect that trend to continue. CPRX stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.TJX Companies (TJX)An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.comTJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), the parent company of well-known retailers such as T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Sierra, Homegoods and Homesense, offers discounted apparel and home goods by 20% to 60% below department stores or online retailers.TJX has roughly 4,700 stores in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Europe.Earnings for the company’s fiscal Q4 2023 (ending Jan. 28, 2023) included revenue of $14.52 billion, up 4.8% from a year ago and better than analysts’ expectations for $14.07 billion. It’s guiding for continued solid performance for this quarter, with projected comparable store sales to be up 2% to 3% and earnings per share to range from 68 cents to 71 cents.TJX stock is holding steady this year, down about 2% since January 1, but I’m expecting a solid April to make this one of the best retailers you can buy. And it also offers a decent dividend yield of 1.7%.Like other names on this list, TJX stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier held VLO, BP, DGII and CPRX.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for PepsiCo:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$12b ÷ (US$92b - US$27b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, PepsiCo has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Beverage industry average of 14% it's much better. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo roceIn the above chart we have measured PepsiCo's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering PepsiCo here  for free.What Can We Tell From PepsiCo's ROCE Trend?Things have been pretty stable at PepsiCo, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at PepsiCo in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. That probably explains why PepsiCo has been paying out 66% of its earnings as dividends to shareholders. These mature businesses typically have reliable earnings and not many places to reinvest them, so the next best option is to put the earnings into shareholders pockets.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In a nutshell, PepsiCo has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Since the stock has gained an impressive 95% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.PepsiCo does have some risks though, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for PepsiCo  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?
