In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$3.48b', 'US$5.05b', 'US$5.79b', 'US$8.09b', 'US$9.61b', 'US$10.9b', 'US$12.1b', 'US$13.0b', 'US$13.9b', 'US$14.5b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x10', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 18.86%', 'Est @ 13.87%', 'Est @ 10.37%', 'Est @ 7.93%', 'Est @ 6.22%', 'Est @ 5.02%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% ', 'US$3.2k', 'US$4.3k', 'US$4.5k', 'US$5.8k', 'US$6.3k', 'US$6.6k', 'US$6.7k', 'US$6.6k', 'US$6.5k', 'US$6.3k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$57b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.319. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

AvidXchange crushed our Q3 earnings estimates in early November and boosted its outlook.', 'AVDX stock has surged since its release to take it above key moving averages. AvidXchange is also gaining more attention from Wall Street.', 'On top of that, AvidXchange trades for around $11 per share and roughly 60% below its post-IPO highs in late 2021 right as the market peaked.', 'AvidXchange’s core business is focused on accounts payable automation software and payment solutions for mid-market businesses and their suppliers. AVDX aims to help boost efficiency, visibility, and control across the entire accounts payable process, while also attempting to reduce costs and risks.', ""AvidXchange’s customers can integrate its offerings within their current accounting systems and enterprise resource planning solutions from Intuit’s QuickBooks to Microsoft Dynamics and beyond. AVDX's specific offerings include AI-powered invoice automation software, purchase order software, purchase-to-pay automation, and much more."", 'AvidXchange’s accounts payable software is hardly flashy, but successfully operating in the background has helped it amass nearly 9,000 customers across real estate, construction, financial services, healthcare, technology, and beyond.', 'AvidXchange posted a solid beat-and-raise third quarter on November 8. The firm reported adjusted earnings of +$0.03 a share to blow away the Zacks estimate of a -$0.05 per share loss on the back of 20% revenue growth.', 'AVDX has crushed our bottom-line estimates for four periods running.

Current Zacks estimates call for Sonos’ adjusted earnings to slide another 12% in FY24 on marginally lower revenue.', 'SONO’s FY24 consensus estimate has slipped by 24% since its mid-November earnings release, with its FY25 estimate now 19% lower. These negative EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now.', 'Sonos currently trades over 60% below its all-time highs. SONO stock is down 7% in 2023 vs. its industry’s 12% gain and the S&P 500’s 20% climb. The underperformance includes a roughly 40% surge since its Q4 release on November 15.', 'The rebound has Sonos attempting to retake its 200-day moving average.

Futures for January delivery ended Friday at $2.81 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, retreating some 6.2% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization is also the result of high supply and mild weather.', 'As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With mild weather across major parts of the United States and forecasts for above-normal temperature in the longer term, usage of the commodity to generate electricity is expected to be tepid.', 'As it is, natural gas is under pressure from near-record output, with current inventory levels well above the year-ago figure and the five-year average. The full restart of the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas is also likely to contribute significantly toward the global supply picture. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by a blast in June last year and has been functioning only partially since its resumption in February.', 'Having said all of that, there are signs of curtailment in domestic output. According to energy services provider Baker Hughes, the U.S. natural gas rig count — a pointer to where production is headed — is down some 25% from last year. Industry observers believe this could set the stage for a pullback in near-term drilling and supplies.', 'Meanwhile, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is supporting natural gas. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months, recently reaching record levels due to environmental reasons and Europe’s endeavor to move away from its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies due to the war in Ukraine.', 'Following last week’s decrease, the natural gas market is down more than 37% so far this year. Based on several factors, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather and production patterns. As such, investors are clueless about what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for holding on to fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, Coterra Energy and Cheniere Energy.', 'Range Resources: RRC is a leading operator in the prolific Appalachian Basin — a premier natural gas play — with huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades.

4,d54e9eb4-0fda-330a-b696-110c2364c334,ARE,2023-12-06,"Alexandria (ARE) Rewards Investors, Hikes Dividend by 2.4%",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alexandria-rewards-investors-hikes-dividend-154400356.html,1701791040,STORY,['ARE'],"['Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE announced a 2.4% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2023 cash dividend payout. Delighting its shareholders, the company will now pay out a dividend of $1.27 per share, up from the $1.24 paid out in the prior quarter. The increased dividend will be paid out on Jan 12, 2024 to shareholders on record as of Dec 29, 2023.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $5.08 per share. This results in an annualized yield of about 4.24%, considering Alexandria’s closing price of $119.89 on Dec 4. For the year ending Dec 31, 2023, the common stock dividend marks an increase of 24 cents or 5% year over year.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for real estate investment trust investors, and Alexandria remains committed to that. It has increased its dividend 11 times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 5.56%. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream. Check Alexandria’s dividend history here.', ""Alexandria's primary emphasis is on the development of Class A/A+ properties strategically located within AAA innovation cluster regions. These locations are highly appealing to life science, agtech and technology companies seeking tenancy. Moreover, these locations are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants and a limited supply of available space. Tenants mainly rely on a central lab-based infrastructure to optimize their research capabilities and workflow, making it difficult for them to switch locations frequently.Given this backdrop, the company is generally able to command high rents at its properties, aiding steady revenues. From the beginning of 2023 through Sep 30, Alexandria’s total leasing activity aggregated 3.4 million rentable square feet (“RSF”) of space. In the last 12 months, 80% of the leasing activity was generated from the company’s client base of 825 tenants. Lease renewals and re-leasing of space amounted to nearly 2.6 million RSF.Moreover, the company’s Class A/A+ properties in AAA locations are experiencing high demand, aiding occupancy levels and rent growth. As of Sep 30, 2023, the occupancy of Alexandria’s operating properties in North America remained high at 93.7%. It registered rental rate growth of 33.9% during the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023. \xa0Given the healthy demand for its premium assets, this upbeat trend is likely to continue in the upcoming period, driving solid organic growth. For 2023, we expect Alexandria’s same-store occupancy to be 94.1%. Rental income is expected to increase 9.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2023.Moreover, as of Sep 30, 2023, investment-grade or publicly traded large-cap tenants accounted for 49% of the annual rental revenues in effect. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all tenants was seven years as of the end of the third quarter. For Alexandria’s top 20 tenants, it was 8.9 years. The lease term has remained steady over the recent quarters. This ensures steady rental revenues over the long term.Alexandria has adequate financial flexibility to enhance its market position and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. The company had $5.9 billion of liquidity at the end of the third quarter of 2023. The net debt and preferred stock to adjusted EBITDA was 5.4X, and the fixed-charge coverage was 4.8X in the third quarter of 2023 on an annualized basis. As of the end of the third quarter, Alexandria had no debt maturities before 2025, and its weighted-average remaining term was 13.1 years.For the five-year period ending Dec 31, 2023, Alexandria expects to generate for reinvestment an aggregate of $1.8 billion of net cash provided by operating activities after dividends.Its funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio remains favorably low at 55% for the three months ended Sep 30, 2023. Looking at the company’s solid operating platform, balance sheet strength, ability to generate cash flows and payout ratio, it is likely to be able to sustain the hiked dividend.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 18.4% in the past month compared with the industry’s rise of 10.3%."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Iron Mountain IRM and STAG Industrial, Inc.

Despite these challenges, the underlying fundamentals of the water industry continue to attract a diverse range of investors, including private equity funds and well-established industrial manufacturing companies. While the cost of capital has increased, there is an influx of infrastructure funding from the U.S. and EU into municipal markets, as per a report by Bluefield Research.

Firstly, the adoption of digitalization is revolutionizing water management, ensuring improved quality and quantity control with the support of technologies like 5G, blockchain, and cloud solutions. Secondly, wastewater processing is evolving through advanced oxidation processes, adsorption/biosorption, and biological remedies to reduce pollutants. Advanced filtration, driven by nanotechnology, is allowing the development of membranes that efficiently remove micropollutants, while biological filtration is gaining recognition as well. Moreover, flood prevention is advancing with improved designs, monitoring, forecasting, and catastrophe modeling. Water-saving technologies, including water reuse, recycling, and intelligent irrigation, are gaining momentum. Decentralized infrastructure is becoming popular for enhancing community resilience, with modular and mobile treatment systems providing alternatives to centralized systems. Furthermore, material science is contributing innovative materials to enhance water management efficiency. Lastly, desalination is evolving with a focus on cost reduction and environmental impact mitigation, utilizing renewable energy and biomimicry for salt extraction from seawater.', ""Deloitte observed that electric power companies are increasingly recognizing and disclosing water risk in their financial reports, highlighting potential challenges such as reduced generation and negative business impacts due to factors like inadequate precipitation, drought, and regulatory actions limiting water supplies. The rising water stress has led to increased water costs, particularly evident in nuclear power plants where average water and coolant expenses rose from US$138 to US$140 per megawatt between 2021 and 2022. Thermal power plants, relying on water for cooling, face efficiency issues and environmental regulations restricting water discharge. Western hydroelectric plants may be at risk of shutdown due to low water levels, but overall, the US power production has become less water-intensive over the years. The growth of wind and solar photovoltaic generation is expected to contribute to this trend as they don't rely on cooling water. However, the emerging trend of using electrolysis for green hydrogen production could potentially raise water consumption.

To skip the details about Mr. Bacon’s life, portfolio performance, and investment strategy, go directly to Billionaire Louis Bacon's 5 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential."", 'Louis Bacon is a macro-trading legend on Wall Street. Macro traders capitalize on financial markets through examination of economic indicators like GDP growth, inflation rates, and unemployment data to make strategic investment decisions. Mr. Bacon founded his investment management firm Moore Capital Management in 1989 with $25,000, and before closing his hedge fund in 2019, the firm had average annualized returns of 17.6% since its inception.\xa0', 'While Louis Bacon is one of the most respected investors, he has had his fair share of failures at the beginning of his investing career and learned from them. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in American literature in 1979 from Middlebury College in Vermont and worked as a clerk at Walter N. Frank & Co. while he was completing his MBA from Columbia Business School. Bacon’s initial investments involved trading commodities, and he lost on sugar, cotton, and gold contracts three times in a row. He had to ask his father for help and started seeing success after his fourth attempt.', 'Some of Louis Bacon’s most successful trades include predicting the 1987 market crash, shorting the S&P futures, and later, taking long positions when the market hit its bottom. In 1989, shortly after establishing his hedge fund, he shorted the Japanese Nikkei index and returned 86% due to the Japanese market crash. Finally, he also predicted Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and made big money on oil. By 2019, his flagship, Remington funds, made a cumulative return of over 21,000%.', 'He closed his fund to outside investors in 2019 mentioning poor performance in the prior couple of years. He said in a letter:', '“Dear Investor, As Moore Capital Management (MCM) approaches its 30th year at the end of this decade, the time is propitious to take a step I have eyed for some time and “privatize” our three multi manager flagship funds-- that is to say returning client assets and funding the multi-manager program with private capital from the principals at MCM. These three funds –MGI (Moore Global Investments), RIS (Remington Investment Strategies) and MMM (Moore Macro Advisors)--will (post the return of investor funds) be consolidated into one proprietary fund which will continue to trade and invest with the same line-up of Portfolio Managers, but with less participation from me. Although this has not been an easy decision given the loyalty of Moore’s macro investors over the decades to whom I am forever grateful, it will allow me the space to step away for significant periods of time when my other interests abound without the ongoing weight and responsibility of looking after public investors’ capital on a continual basis. Disappointing results of these funds of the last few years obviously inform this decision but our long term record is one we remain proud of having delivered a net annualized return of 17.6% and a cumulative return of over 21,000% since inception for our original flagship Remington funds; annualized return of 15% for MGI and a cumulative return of 61 times original investors capital. MMM has returned 11% over its shorter lifespan. All three of the funds have returned low single digits year to date in 2019. Intense competition for trading talent coupled with client pressure on fees has led to a challenging business model for multi manager funds such as ours.”', 'Despite stepping down as a hedge fund manager, Louis Bacon still has an investment portfolio. His top picks with huge upside potential include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and CRH plc (NYSE:CRH). The legendary investor is also involved in options trading and has leveraged Call options on iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF and Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund. Additionally, Mr. Bacon seems to be keeping a bearish sentiment on the market and has placed Put options against SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. He also placed nearly $27 million worth of bets against Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in Q3.', 'In the third quarter, Louis Bacon’s 13F portfolio was worth $5.36 billion, compared to $5.81 billion in the previous quarter. Bacon made several changes to his portfolio over the quarter, including making over 170 new purchases and closing out of 193 stocks. Some of his notable purchases include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT). Bacon’s top three stocks in the third quarter were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

These investments reflect some 57 GW of long-duration storage. In the U.S., meanwhile, the Department of Energy has been focused on supporting the commercialization of this market.\xa0', '“When we think about the path to net-zero, we’re going to need a lot of different technologies in our ecosystem to really get us to where we need to go,” Marlene Motyka, Deloitte’s U.S. renewable energy leader, said.\xa0', 'This will include lithium-ion batteries as well as what she refers to as “mid-term” duration storage, like iron-air or zinc-based batteries. In addition, the system is going to need some very long-duration – even seasonal – energy storage, that can pitch in for months at a time, like hydrogen-based storage.\xa0', 'Multiple players are bringing these technologies to the market, and utility regulators are showing interest in them. In May, the California Public Utilities Commission gave the green light to Pacific Gas & Electric to move forward with an 8.5 MW microgrid, comprising a hybrid battery and hydrogen fuel cell system, developed by Energy Vault and located at a Northern California substation that experiences wildfire-related outages. The system is expected to generate up to 293 MWh over a 48-hour period, according to PG&E’s filing.\xa0', 'Energy Vault is also working on a gravity energy storage solution, which uses a mechanical process of lifting and lowering composite blocks made from soil and waste materials to store and dispatch energy. In August, the company announced it had executed its first license and royalty agreement for the technology with an as-yet undisclosed U.S.-based renewables developer.', 'And in September, Dominion Energy approached Virginia regulators for approval of a storage project that will test two new technologies – iron-air batteries developed by Form Energy, which the company says can provide 100 hours of electricity storage, and zinc-hybrid batteries from Eos Energy, which can store power for anywhere between three and 12 hours.', 'Looking over the next decade, the electric grid is going to need a mix of storage solutions, varying from state to state depending on their electric generation portfolio and load profiles, Motyka said. But some technologies are likely to emerge as more prominent than others —\xa0for instance, because they don’t have geographical limitations.', 'The long-term robustness of technologies’ supply chains will also be an important factor in whether they can scale, said Craig Rizzo, managing director with Deloitte Consulting’s Energy, Resources & Industrials practice. Other factors to look at include the environmental footprint of the technology and its supply chain, as well as the reliability of the asset itself.\xa0', '“Compare it to the reliability of what it will be replacing on the grid right now – natural gas generation for example. It has to be there when it’s needed,” Rizzo added.\xa0', 'Utility Dive examined four technologies at the forefront of the growing energy storage sector, and spoke to some of the companies bringing them to market, to get a better picture of the emerging storage landscape.\xa0', 'The end of each section includes a snapshot that examines one key player, how they produce the storage technology, their current and upcoming projects, and other details. The snapshots are not meant to provide a comprehensive look at each technology.', 'Zinc-based batteries have multiple characteristics that differentiate them from lithium-ion. This includes longer durations as storage, as well as the fact that the aqueous-based systems are non-flammable, Andy Meserve, vice president of business development at Eos, said. The systems experience very low degradation and can last for 20-plus years, he added —\xa0in line with the life cycle of a lot of renewable energy plants, which is typically 20 to 30 years.\xa0', '“Another key component of ours is we operate in a very wide temperature range —\xa0we have no need for heating and air conditioning” unlike lithium-ion batteries, Meserve added.\xa0', 'These batteries could meet multiple needs in the power market, especially in terms of energy shifting or arbitrage – either storing renewables when they are plentiful on the grid and then dispatching them later on, or charging at low power prices and discharging at high ones, according to Meserve. In addition, they could play a role in microgrids, when coupled with renewables or other resources.\xa0', 'Like developers of other storage technologies, Eos is focused now on ramping up its manufacturing. Earlier this year, the company received an up to $398.6 million conditional loan guarantee from the Department of Energy to expand a manufacturing plant producing its zinc-powered storage systems.\xa0', 'Zinc-based storage does have certain benefits. The technology is flexible in sizing, and zinc is abundant as a raw material, Deloitte’s Motyka said. On the flipside, there’s only so much duration you can get out of it. Zinc-based batteries can provide up to 12 hours of duration currently and can be scaled to go much longer.\xa0', '“You can keep building these modular pieces and attaching them together – but at some point, it may just not make sense because of the size,” she said.', 'How it works: The technology stores energy using zinc deposition. Zinc-based batteries consist of a graphite felt and conductive plastic inside, and the zinc essentially adheres to and then releases itself from the graphite and conductive plastic to charge or discharge.', 'Key player: Eos Energy Storage', 'Capacity range:\xa0NA', 'Duration range:\xa03-12 hours, with the possibility to go longer ', 'Projects operational in the U.S.: None', 'Projects under development (around the world):\xa0The company’s pipeline of projects was at $11.6 billion and over 43 GWh as of Nov 7, with $10 billion in active proposals and $1.5 billion in signed letters of intent.\xa0Its backlog stood at $539 million, representing over 2 GWh as of Sept. 30.', 'Show more ▼', 'Form Energy’s iron-air battery systems comprise modules that are roughly the size of a washer and dryer set, with cells that include iron and air electrodes. One of the technology’s benefits is that it is built with active components that are safe, cheap and easily found, according to the company.\xa0', 'There’s also the multi-day duration it provides —\xa0roughly 100 hours, which means it can be a great grid reliability resource, according to Mateo Jaramillo, Form Energy’s CEO. While single-digit hour durations are also important, the grid is going to need storage in the “100-hour regime” to address longer weather-driven events, he said.', 'While the primary use case for iron-air batteries is currently as a reliability resource, Form Energy’s modeling indicates that the battery can be used throughout the year. The batteries can also be used by utilities and others to balance energy supply and demand week to week.', 'The key challenge that Form Energy currently faces in terms of scaling up its technology is to build out its manufacturing capabilities —\xa0essentially “become a manufacturing company,” Jaramillo said.\xa0', '“We’re building that function very, very quickly and actively, but it is new and anytime we do something new there’s risk,” Jaramillo said.', 'The technology offers a lot of flexibility, and can be dispatched in a way to support the concept of baseload generation, Deloitte’s Motyka said.', '“What they’re touting is much cheaper, with it lasting much longer as well in comparison to lithium-ion,” Rizzo agreed. “Certainly it all sounds good on paper. I think the key is to just see it in action here.”', 'How it works: The battery uses a process called “reversible rusting.” It converts iron metal to rust to discharge, and uses an electrical current to convert the rust back to iron to charge.', 'Key player: Form Energy', 'Capacity range:\xa0Can scale from demonstration projects in the range of 5 MW – 10 MW to larger projects in the range of hundreds of MW', 'Duration range:\xa0Up to 100 hours ', 'Projects operational in the U.S.: None ', 'Projects under development in the U.S.: With Dominion Energy (VA) - 5 MW/500 MWh iron-air battery system to go online in 2026', 'With Xcel Energy - 10 MW/1,000 MWh iron-air battery system at the Sherburne County Generating Station in Becker, Minnesota and 10 MW/1,000 MWh iron-air battery system at the Comanche Generating Station in Pueblo, Colorado. Both projects are expected to come online in 2025', 'With Georgia Power (GA) - 15 MW/1,500 MWh iron-air battery system, expected by 2026', 'With support from NYSERDA (NY) - 10 MW/1,000 MWh iron-air battery system, expected by 2026', 'With Great River Energy (MN) - 1.5 megawatt/150 MWh iron-air battery pilot project expected to come online by late 2024', 'Show more ▼', 'In late 2022, Pacific Gas & Electric came to California regulators with a proposal for a hybrid battery energy storage and hydrogen fuel cell system, to be developed by Energy Vault in a Northern California town that experiences relatively frequent power shut-offs due to wildfire risks. The utility has historically used diesel generators to meet this need, but the switch to green hydrogen and batteries allows for a cleaner source of back-up power during these outages. The microgrid is expected to come into operation in 2024.\xa0', 'Hydrogen-based energy storage allows the power sector to use renewable energy and electrolyzer systems to create green hydrogen, which can then be stored for as long as needed until being converted back to electricity using fuel cells. The PG&E microgrid has a 48-hour duration, with the potential to expand up to 96 hours – but hydrogen allows for the possibility to store energy for much longer periods, even seasonally.\xa0', 'The PG&E system uses Energy Vault’s ‘H-Vault’ platform, designed for durations starting from 24 hours to seasonal storage. The system can be deployed starting at 1 MW and is offered as a standard solution for 24, 50, and 100 hours, as well as any customizable size. In terms of the cost, with support from the Inflation Reduction Act and at 100 hours duration, the system is in line with a diesel genset, according to Marco Terruzzin, chief commercial and product officer at Energy Vault. Energy Vault has other hydrogen storage projects in the pipeline, but these have not yet been publicly disclosed.\xa0', 'The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act has given the technology a boost in the U.S., in part because it allows asset owners using hydrogen as a storage medium to tap into the investment tax credit, Terruzzin said.', 'Hydrogen’s potential to store energy for months at a time to be utilized as needed could be very important in the future, as policy-makers think about balancing the grid, Motyka said.', 'At the same time, one of the big challenges that hydrogen-based storage will face when it comes to deploying at scale is developing the infrastructure to support it, according to Motyka.', '“A lot still has to happen with regard to the infrastructure behind the whole hydrogen ecosystem —\xa0generating it, having the right places to store it, then being able to call on it and use it,” she said.', 'In October, the DOE announced the selection of seven regional hydrogen hubs —\xa0with $7 billion in total funding —\xa0across the country, which are expected to jointly produce three million metric tons of hydrogen each year. That announcement is a positive step in the right direction, Motyka said.\xa0', 'How it works: Renewable energy and electrolyzer systems are used to create green hydrogen, which can then be stored as long as needed until being converted back to electricity.', 'Key player: Energy Vault', 'Capacity range:\xa01 MW and above', 'Duration range:\xa04 hours to seasonal or longer ', 'Projects operational in the U.S.: None', 'Projects under development in the U.S.:\xa08.5 MW hybrid battery energy storage and hydrogen fuel cell system with PG&E', 'Show more ▼', 'Using gravity as a form of energy storage has been around for a while, in the form of pumped hydropower —\xa0but using mobile masses is a relatively new concept, which Energy Vault has also been working on.\xa0', 'The technology essentially uses a mechanical process of lifting and lowering composite blocks made from soil and waste materials to store and dispatch energy, and Energy Vault says that it isn’t dependent on a specific topography, offers a flexible duration that can go from four to 24 hours, and has a 35-year lifespan.\xa0', 'The company is currently working on a 25 MW/100 MWh system just outside of Shanghai, built close to a wind farm. It is also working with Enel Green Power on a 18 MW/ 36 MWh gravity-based system in Snyder, Texas, expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2024.', 'In terms of likely use cases, companies that would be interested in gravity energy storage would be interested in it for a duration of at least six hours, according to Terruzzin.', '“That doesn’t mean that gravity cannot be applied for four hours —\xa0but the market will be very interested, and is very interested, [in] gravity for a six-hour duration and longer,” he said.\xa0', 'In some ways, the idea of simple, mechanical devices for energy storage makes sense, according to Deloitte’s Rizzo.', '“It’s a low environmental footprint, there’s no supply chain issues, and it can scale —\xa0you can do it at really small scale, or really large scale,” he noted.\xa0', 'Importantly, unlike a resource like hydrogen, gravity-based storage doesn’t have to rely on years or decades of future research, he said.\xa0', '“It’s here now. So will we someday be way past raising rocks and lowering them?\xa0For sure, but as interim solutions to fill gaps where we have them right now, I think we should continue taking a close look at that,” he said.\xa0', 'How it works: With gravity storage, heavy composite blocks are lifted, and energy is stored as potential energy. When the blocks are lowered, they turn electric generators to produce power.', 'Key player: Energy Vault', 'Capacity range:\xa0More than 50 MW, and no upper limit', 'Duration range:\xa04-24 hours', 'Projects operational in the U.S.: None', 'Projects under development in the U.S.:\xa018 MW/36 MWh system in Snyder, Texas', 'Show more ▼', 'This story was originally published on Utility Dive.

The DOJ argues the merger would harm competition, while the airlines argue they need to merge to compete with bigger airlines. The case is now up to a Boston federal court judge to decide."", 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""JARED BLIKRE: Well, it is now time for Trending Tickers. We are just talking about China. And we got to talk Starbucks. Those shares are dropping this afternoon. Now that's after the CEO noted that the recovery in China is happening at a rate slower than what you would expect. Stock hitting 11 straight sessions--"", ""JULIE HYMAN: I think it's 12 now."", ""JARED BLIKRE: I think it'll be 12 as of today, 11 in the books. And I'll tell you what, on the YFi interactive, I have an intraday chart. And it took a leg south. You can see it right there when the Starbucks CEO said, China normalizing at half the expected pace. And he says the recovery expected to be choppy."", ""Let me show you a one-month chart, Julie. And this is not good. This is that 12 days, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, all the way down to 12. And that is pretty steady there. In the context of the year-to-date, now we're underwater by about 3.77%. Looking at a five-year chart, that's just really choppy to slightly up price action. So not the best for shareholders in Starbucks recently."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And if you look at the company's numbers and how much it gets internationally here, it's about a fifth of its annual sales from international overall. But like so many companies, Starbucks has been looking for-- even though it's not on a percentage basis a huge portion of its sales, it had been, in the hopes of Starbucks at least and many other companies, a growth engine, right?"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yes.', ""JARED BLIKRE: So if what Shehzad Qazi of China Beige Book, who we just spoke to, is correct, he said China's miracle growth story is over. And so you have to wonder all of these companies that have put so much investment into China betting on that increase in growth. You know, will they have to now pivot and try a different strategy if this does continue?"", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And engine of growth, maybe not, but they're too big to ignore. So nobody's leaving China. All right. We got to talk 23andMe. Those shares under pressure for the genetic testing company. Company confirming its data breaches and that they have affected nearly 7 million customers. The anonymous hacker accessed those profiles and posted them for sale on the internet earlier this year."", 'And let me show-- let us go back to the YFi interactive. This is a max chart. And this shows since their IPO in early 2022, it has been a jagged line down. Let me put lines there. And you can see, it is now basically a penny stock. So this stock has more problems than a data breach, I would say.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I mean, there were things that sort of predated the data breach. But this doesn't help, because what it does is realize the worst fears of the critics who have pointed to the likes of 23andMe or ancestry.com, what have you, that you're not just sharing your name you're sharing your actual genetic information. And so it wasn't many users of 23andMe that were affected by this. I think it's about 14,000 users, which is a small proportion. But again, it's the idea of the kind of information that these folks have access to."", ""This, you know, the company has been trying to change its business model over the past several years. To your point, that hasn't really helped the slide in the stock here. I believe it went public through a SPAC. So as always, $10 is the sort of reference point for that. Not that falling below $1 is good for anybody, but just to give you an idea of where they have come from, in this particular case."", ""JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. I had a brief statement by the company here. It's going to cost them $1 to $2 billion. You can consider that a drop in the bucket for a large company. It is what it is."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Reputational probably more than actual dollars and cents. Well, taking a look now at shares of Spirit Airlines and JetBlue. The company is defending their $3.8 billion deal the Department of Justice's case to block JetBlue's acquisition of Spirit. Both sides had their closing arguments today. And so now a judge will have to determine if this deal is going to be harmful for growth."", ""Judging from the stock reaction today, it seems as though investors are not terribly optimistic here that this deal is indeed going to get approved. And of course, in the background of this is Hawaiian Airlines just announced a deal with Alaska. Now, it's not apples to apples, obviously. But you're looking at what has been a pretty active Justice Department and FTC when it comes to these kinds of deals."", ""JARED BLIKRE: The airline industry reminds me of the media industry, the way it just-- it tears itself apart. And then it kind of reforms Voltron. It's all about the mergers and acquisitions and the divestitures. Let's go to the YFi interactive. Just want to chart JetBlue's price action over the last five years. And you can see, it took a leg south here. This is probably on some of that Spirit news."", ""Here's Spirit Airlines, hasn't been doing that well either. The stock is down 13 bucks and change and pretty close to those pandemic lows of 2020. Is the company better off than it was back then? I would say so. The future should be a bit brighter, but not necessarily seeing that reflected in the share price."", 'And I would say, too, the Justice Department is on a little bit of a roll. They were able to block the American Airlines JetBlue partnership. So maybe the fangs are out here. The teeth are able to sink into this. If the judge rules in favor of the Department of Justice, then I would have to think there could be more. Maybe Hawaiian gets a microscope.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, let's see. I mean at issue here is whether fares are going to go up as a result of this deal. That's one of the main things that the judge is continuing. We'll see.""]"

To skip our analysis of the tech industry and its recent trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment.', ""Market experts and analysts alike have been baffled by the events of 2023. Just a year ago, there was widespread agreement that the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation through interest rate hikes would trigger a recession in the United States. However, things have not unfolded as predicted, at least not so far. The unpredictable consequences of prolonged high-interest rates, the surge in artificial intelligence (AI), and escalating geopolitical tensions have resulted in significantly varied perspectives among forecasters. As an example, Deutsche Bank anticipates a substantial recession, while Goldman Sachs remains optimistic, foreseeing an economic resurgence propelled by a resilient job market."", 'As we approach the threshold of 2024, the landscape of the technology job market is experiencing a profound transformation driven by progress in AI, data analytics, and cybersecurity. Artificial Intelligence in particular stands out as potentially the most significant technological breakthrough in our lifetimes, drawing comparisons from Wall Street analysts to pivotal innovations such as the internet. Although there is widespread agreement that AI will eventually transform the economy and enhance corporate profits, there is intense debate about the timing and extent of these revolutionary and lucrative changes. Skeptics contend that, particularly in the stock market realm, the enthusiasm surrounding AI has outpaced actual developments, potentially leaving some highly valued stocks vulnerable to a decline should the economy experience a slowdown. With that said, the unyielding surge in tech stocks driven by AI, which commenced in 2023, seems to be displaying no signs of stopping. Of course, many analysts weren\'t entirely caught off-guard by this turbulence. For instance, in December 2022, Dan Ives from Wedbush had anticipated opportunities in the tech sector after the tumultuous events of the previous year. At that time, he asserted that tech stocks were poised for a 20% growth in 2023. In more recent statements, he suggests that those who hold a pessimistic view on AI risk missing out, emphasizing that ""The bears try to look smart while the bulls make money.""', ""On the other hand, the global semiconductor industry seems to be making a comeback as well. Given that computing is at the core of technology, the semiconductor sector stands out as one of the most crucial segments in the technology industry. While the semiconductor industry thrived in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, inflation took its toll on the market in 2022, dampening demand for expensive processors, graphics cards, and laptops. This resulted in chip designers grappling with excess inventories in the pipeline, contributing to an overall slowdown as markets faltered. Signs suggest that the surplus may be resolving. Take, for example, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s recent financial results, revealing a 43% annual increase in sales for the company's latest Ryzen 7000 series—a positive indication that consumers are finally beginning to spend again."", 'In general, the tech sector is positioned for growth as an increasing number of companies express intentions to participate in the race for AI and data analytics.

Basically, the thesis surrounds the nature of such transactions. Frankly, insiders sell securities for a variety of reasons, including mundane ones like tax considerations. However, there’s only one reason to buy a security: you believe it will move higher.', 'Another factor that makes stocks insiders are buying so attractive is the alignment of interests. Imagine that you’re onboard an airplane flying across the continental U.S. That’s about a five-hour flight or so, depending on the direction. Chances are, irrespective of the length of the flight, you want your pilot in the airplane with you.', 'Now, the presence of a pilot doesn’t guarantee a safe landing. Obviously, in the history of aviation, stuff happened and they will unfortunately continue to happen (hopefully with less frequency). But no matter what, it’s better to have a pilot than no pilot onboard. On that note, below are stocks with insider buying to consider.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational designer, developer, manufacturer and supplier of a wide range of semiconductor products, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks among the most relevant technology enterprises. It’s not surprising, then, that the company also represents one of the stocks with insider buying. Per Gurufocus, two directors – one on Sept. 6 and the other on Sept. 15 – acquired shares of AVGO.', 'To be fair, Broadcom has witnessed a spike in insider selling this year as well, more so than acquisitions. So, why mention it among stocks insiders are buying? For one thing, AVGO has been a top performer this year, gaining nearly 71% since the January opener. Yet the two directors anticipate further growth, which is a significant catalyst, at least from a sentiment perspective.', 'Second, AVGO offers an alternative to overheated semiconductor specialists. While I wouldn’t call Broadcom a steal, its forward earnings multiple of 21.09x is far more palatable than some other stats in the chip-manufacturing space. Plus, analysts consider the tech giant a consensus strong buy.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'A chain of specialty discount stores, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) distinguishes itself from similar enterprises with its pricing variety. Most of its products go from $1 to $5, hence the name. However, a select few products sell for up to $25. Therefore, Five Below isn’t just a discount store for the desperate. Instead, it offers an attractive canvas for good old bargain hunting.', 'Further, the underlying business model aligns with increasingly negative fundamental sentiment. Per CNBC, many experts believe that a downturn of some sort is inevitable. If so, households will be incentivized to save money wherever possible. Cynically, this framework should help lift FIVE. Subsequently, it’s no surprise to see shares rank among stocks with insider buying.', 'In particular, Five President and CEO Joel D. Anderson bought 3,100 shares in early September. To be fair, many other executives dumped out of FIVE stock. However, when head execs decide to put their money where their mouth is, it means so much more. As well, FIVE earns a strong buy assessment from analysts.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in Ferguson, Missouri, Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) manufactures products and provides engineering services for industrial, commercial and consumer markets. Both the company’s website and its Form 10-K deploy word salad to describe its business: automation, cohesion, acceleration, efficiencies, challenges and value. Since the start of the year, EMR slipped roughly 9%.', 'Perhaps the biggest (tangible) takeaway here is that it’s one of the top stocks with insider buying. Per Gurufocus, Emerson President and CEO Lal Karsanbhai bought 10,000 shares of EMR on Nov. 17. Earlier this month, four directors also acquired EMR, in total adding 14,400 shares to their holdings. If you’re looking for a confidence boost, that’s it.', 'Another factor moving in favor of Emerson is its value proposition. Right now, shares trade at only 3.84X trailing earnings. In contrast, the industrial products industry features an average multiple of 22.63X. As well, it offers a forward dividend yield of 2.39%. Combined with a moderate buy consensus view, Emerson brings an enticing narrative to the table.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock', 'As a major agricultural chemical and seed company, Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) symbolizes one of the most relevant stocks insiders are buying. Unfortunately, that hasn’t helped the cause in terms of market performance. Since the beginning of this year, CTVA lost nearly 23% of equity value. In the past 52 weeks, it dipped almost 31%, which is obviously problematic.', 'However, the underlying fundamentals for Corteva command permanent relevance. In future conflicts, nations might not fight over oil rights but rather resources necessary for basic sustenance. Therefore, I can’t say I’m shocked that several C-suite members decided to buy shares earlier this month. Most notably, Corteva CEO Charles V. Magro bought 40,000 shares back in February.', 'Also, in terms of book value, CTVA trades at 1.28X. That’s undervalued compared to agriculture industry’s average book multiple of 1.63X. Notably, the company enjoys strong gross and operating margins. As a small bonus, Corteva offers a forward yield of 1.4%. Lastly, analysts rate CTVA a moderate buy with a $55.93 average price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A multinational soft drink company, Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) fundamentally might benefit from the trade-down effect. Should economic conditions experience a slowdown, consumers will likely pivot their expenditures from food and beverage retail places to the grocery stores. In turn, this transition should cynically help KDP. And it does need help, suffered red ink since the start of this year.', 'Still, it’s been bouncing back quite sharply in recent sessions, supporting the case that KDP is one of the stocks insiders are buying. Notably, Keurig’s Chief Operating Officer Timothy P. Cofer bought 100,000 shares of KDP on Nov. 8. Late last month, the company’s Chief Research and Development Officer acquired 7,050 shares. In early August, the same officer had 53,837 shares.', 'On paper, Keurig doesn’t necessarily distinguish itself with sterling financials. However, it does command overall excellent margins, leading to consistent profitability over the past decade. Sure enough, the firm also offers a forward yield of 2.64%. Analysts peg KDP a moderate buy, making it one of the intriguing stocks with insider buying.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Fundamentally, Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) appears the riskiest name among stocks insiders are buying, at least as far as this list is concerned. In many other circumstance, Simon Property – a real estate investment trust (REIT) supporting shopping malls and outlet centers – may be reasonable speculation. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 crisis did a number on the business.', 'Now, certain elements appear to be favorable to Simon. In particular, The Wall Street Journal reported that this past Black Friday resulted in strong spending. Foot traffic at U.S. retailers rose 2.1% from last year, with the health and beauty segment witnessing double-digit percentage increases. So, for the moment, people appear to be willing to buy retail at brick-and-mortar locations.', 'With that in mind, the inside acquisitions don’t seem so reckless. Several directors bought SPG in September this year. Additionally, March and June so a flurry of activity, making SPG one of the top stocks with insider buying. Providing some confidence, analysts rate SPG a consensus moderate buy.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'On the surface, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) might not seem the wisest of investments for the long haul. While the world runs on hydrocarbons today, tomorrow (figuratively speaking) could be a different story. With political forces pushing for clean and renewable sources of energy along with the rising popularity of electric vehicles, Occidental’s days seem numbered.', 'Still, I think it’s possible that Occidental could stay relevant for years if not multiple decades. First, we’ve got to talk about energy density. Compared to most other sources, hydrocarbons carry significant bang for the buck. That’s why a jug of gasoline will do more for a combustion-powered car than a similar amount of electrons for an EV.', 'Second, acute geopolitical tensions almost surely means that we must diversify our energy portfolio, not exclude one for another.

Specifically, the period between 2020 and 2021 posed substantial challenges for both payers and providers. Despite these difficulties, there was an uninterrupted momentum of innovation and expansion within healthcare services. Innovation remained a driving force, leading to the introduction of new technologies, telemedicine expansion, and novel treatment approaches. These advancements and innovations have left analysts feeling optimistic about its future prospects. Portfolio Managers at Janus Henderson Investors, Andy Acker and Dan Lyons are optimistic about this situation, suggesting it sets the stage for a promising outlook in the healthcare sector. They mentioned that healthcare is heading into the new year with lower valuations after a period of underperformance.

The report further highlighted that the S&P Biotechnology Industry Index, which measures the performance of big biotech companies within the S&P 500 Index, is currently trading at almost a 25% lower value compared to its average over the past 30 years.

This spending is double what other wealthy countries typically put towards healthcare. The report further mentioned that in 2022, the total earnings of the nine largest intermediaries, known as ""big health,"" reached about 45% of the US healthcare expenses, significantly increasing from 25% in 2013.

Inhabit, which was founded in 2016, counts more than 7,000 property management companies as customers. (There were 290,631 property managers in the U.S. last year, according to IBISWorld.) The company is led by Lisa Stinnett, a managing partner at Greater Sum Ventures, who is also the former chief operating officer of Ministry Brands. Inhabit employs over 1,100 people. The company is backed by Goldman, Greater Sum Ventures, Insight Partners, and PSG.', 'Inhabit was last up for sale roughly four years ago, according to PE Hub. At the time, the company was known as Inhabit IQ but rebranded to just Inhabit in January. Goldman Sachs ended up investing in the company in December 2020. It’s unclear how much Goldman put in, but GS owns a minority of Inhabit, a banker, one of the five, said. (Goldman and PSG declined comment. Inhabit, Jefferies, Greater Sum, and Insight did not return messages for comment.)', 'Goldman used its merchant banking division to invest in Inhabit. In 2020, GS merged its merchant banking operations with asset management, appointing Eric Lane and Julian Salisbury to lead the combined business. Lane left Goldman in 2021 and is now president and COO of Tiger Global Management. Salisbury, who became CIO of Goldman’s asset and wealth management unit in late 2022, is also on his way out. He is joining Sixth Street as a partner and co-CIO early next year. Marc Nachmann is currently global head of Goldman’s asset and wealth management division.', ""Goldman has unloaded other investments this year. In October, GS agreed to sell GreenSky, a specialty lender, to an investor group led by Sixth Street. It also sold its personal financial management unit to Creative Planning, a registered investment advisor, in August. (Greensky and personal financial management were corporate acquisitions for Goldman, while Inhabit is a private equity investment housed in GS's asset management unit.)"", 'The sale of Inhabit comes as M&A is expected to explode next year. About 1,200 private companies are anticipated to run out of money, Fortune reported in October. Private equity dealmaking continues to crawl. So far this year, 4,337 U.S. announced PE merger transactions totaled $220.5 billion, a 34% drop in value from 2022, according to data from LSEG Deals Intelligence. The 4,337 deals are also the lowest number of transactions posted by private equity since 2020. GTCR’s $14.4 billion buy of a majority stake in Worldpay is the year’s biggest U.S. announced PE deal.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

We're seeing competitors be bundled together. I mean, bundling is nothing new, but we're certainly seeing that ramp up, especially over the past year or so. There's the Apple One bundle, where you can get Apple Music along with some other Apple services in there. We know Paramount has partnered with Delta Airlines and Walmart+, and that's a bundled subscription as well."", ""So this is something that's coming about as streamers are really trying to create a sticky environment.

And then, if you go to a company like Verizon, for example, they also don't want to lose subscribers."", 'If you notice any of the cable companies, whenever they report a loss of internet subscribers, broadband subscribers, that wipes off millions of dollars off of their market cap.

Obviously, pricing is one reason to do this, but it could also drag down average revenue per user, metric known as RPU.', ""So at the end of the day, despite all of these bundles becoming more and more popular, companies like a Netflix or a Disney, they need to figure out more strategic ways to limit their spending in order to make sure that critical RPU number doesn't go down. Because this is a discount. At $10 a month, that's 40% of savings on the part of the consumer. So it's a double-edged sword that, if you're a media company, you have to grapple with."", ""JULIE HYMAN: What's also fascinating to me about the bundles is they're not customizable anymore. In other words, like, the bets that are being made are not driven by content, they're being driven by strategy. So if I, as a consumer, want this particular program, like what are the chances that the two companies that happen to decide to partner are the ones who's shows I also want?"", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's a very good point."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So that's also sort of a gamble, maybe. I don't know what-- I mean, like, do we know what consumers decisions are based on now? Is it based on content? Is it based on price? I don't know."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, that's an issue. I think it's based on content in the sense of it's very easy for me to go and cancel my Netflix subscription if the new season of whatever show I'm watching isn't on at that time. Now, I do think there are going to be more opportunities for bundling down the line. All the experts I've spoken with have said expect to see more of this. And it's also a bit of a precursor to some more media M&A to come in 2024. Obviously, right now, it's a little bit of an unfavorable environment."", ""- That's what we need, more media M&A."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.

And Netflix is ready to step in. With more on what this means for the streaming space, we're joined by Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Hey, Allie."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rachelle. And yes, licensing is something we didn't see a ton of even five years ago as these streaming services and media companies really worked to make sure they had exclusive content on their platform. But recently, that's certainly changed as debt levels rise. Interest rates are high. Content spending has ballooned. And across the board, a lot of these media companies are pulling back on some of that content spending. But at the same time, they still want to make sure that they have as much content as possible on their platform, so that they can both reduce churn while also making sure they're continuing to add subscribers."", ""And that's where licensing has come in. Netflix has done this very well if you take a look at some of the shows that they license. Suits, for example, comes to mind. This is something that Ted Sarandos mentioned several times during that conference yesterday. Suits was a USA Network show that went on to Peacock and Amazon before landing on Netflix. And once it did, it absolutely exploded. It was a top show for this platform several months in a row. It generated really strong word of mouth and really showed how powerful licensing can be."", ""Sarandos said during that conference that licensing to US has the added benefit of enhancing IP plus revenue, and we should win the jump balls. In that sense, he's referring to the fact that because of Netflix's search and discovery, because of the fans and viewers on Netflix, when you license a show, it's likely that show is going to perform very well."", ""And it's also worth mentioning that this is not just a Netflix story. Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav. Same with NBC Universal. They've heavily been licensing and have talked about the benefits of licensing moving forward. So that's something to watch as the streaming wars continue to evolve."", ""But outside of licensing, Netflix said that they are focused on other areas of content creation as well. In particular, Unscripted has done really well for Netflix, like the Beckham documentary. But there are still areas of untapped potential. So Ted Sarandos said local language Unscripted is something that the streamer could do more on, in addition to animation. He said out of the top 10 movies, most streamed movies, eight of them were animated titles. So that's something that they want to work on as well. So expect some other areas of growth on the content side as the year moves on, and we head into 2024.""]"

Discovery (WBD), Disney+ (DIS), and Paramount (PARA).', '""The free ad-supported streaming television revolution... has really ramped up the opportunity for advertising on these services. You\'ll see each subscription service also have an ad-supported with lower priced tier over time,"" DeBevoise says, adding: ""The winner there is streaming overall.""', 'Click here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.', ""- And Marc, when it comes to the fact that so many of these companies overspent, to put in your words, when it comes to content, we've seen those losses really be a theme here over the last several quarters. We also started to see more bundling. And we're seeing more and more companies, it seems by the month, that are trying everything they can to lower those churn rates. Do you think that's going to work? And I guess what does that signal just in terms of is this the first step to broader consolidation?"", ""MARC DEBEVOISE: Yeah. So look, I think they are certainly looking at bundling as a way to reduce churn or a way to impact, you know, how they can retain those customers longer-- longer term. But at the end of the day, you're going to see those ARPPUs come down as you do those bundles, right? That ARPPU being Average Revenue Per User. So I think at the end of the day, they're going to give consumers a lot of different choices over the next few years. You're seeing Max and Netflix come together on Verizon's +play. You see the rumor about my old job Paramount Plus and-- and-- and Apple coming together."", ""I think ultimately the long term those-- those channel storefronts that you see on Amazon and Apple and others and I think many other technology platforms will start to bring together a lot of consumer options. Right? You'll have multiple choices of where to go. And you'll have multiple choices of what bundle to create on your own. And I think that's going to be a really great opportunity for consumers. Hopefully, it reduces that churn. But at the end of the day, these services are going to need to find a way to be more efficient with the spend that they're doing."", '- Yeah. Marc, how much pricing power do you think a lot of these streamers still have? The fact that they need to rely maybe a little bit more heavily on some of these bundles, trying to lower the costs, are we almost near that maxing out point when it comes to pricing, at least for now?', ""MARC DEBEVOISE: I think it's going to depend on the content and what you put in each service. Right? You've seen Netflix have meaningful power to go to almost $20 on an average subscriber. And you're seeing others go the other way with lower priced ad supported services. So I think you're going to see a spectrum. It's not a one size fits all."", ""Ultimately though, the idea that they all do need to save money on creating these services, and that's both in content and in technology-- and you know, I took the job as the CEO of Brightcove 18 months ago, with the idea that we could help these companies save some money on their infrastructure. They didn't all need to create the service bespoke on-- you know, on their own platforms. And it's not just the big six. There are hundreds of these companies around the world in each territory and in each area."", ""BRAD SMITH: It's also been the year of the advertising tier too over these past 12 months too. Is it clear whether there's a-- a clear winner in that-- in this early onset that's being able to woo marketers and advertisers and get some of those dollars to kind of offset where some of the users perhaps are saying, you know what, we don't-- we don't even want to see the ad, so we'll either pay up, or we'll pay into that advertising tier and pay less?"", ""MARC DEBEVOISE: Look, I love that that's happened. I think the fast revolution, the free ad supported streaming television revolution with Roku channel and the likes of Samsung TV and others has really ramped up the opportunity for advertising on these services. So you'll see each subscription service also have an ad supported with lower priced tier over time. I think each one will do it. I think the idea there is by the way the winner is streaming overall. Right? You see it ticking up in terms of market share overall in terms of consumption."", ""And I think we almost incorrectly look at it as like, well, broadcast is, you know, flat, and cable is down, and streaming is up. But just this is the new form of distribution and what is going to be the future globally. And so you're going to see every type of business model laid into that distribution format. And so having a strong ad supported service and a capability to be able to deliver that to users is going to be key. And you're seeing it in the ad dollar shift. Right? You're seeing ad dollars shift to that CTV platform now in a meaningful way over the past few years.""]"

However, with his decades of investing experience, his caution definitely merits attention, and it’s probably a smart idea for investors to start adding some value stocks to hedge against potential market volatility.', 'One great way to do that is to follow Buffett’s own moves and look at which value stocks Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) bought into last quarter. As we near the end of 2023, it makes sense to consider where the master value investor himself is putting money right now. Even during rocky times, Buffett keeps an eye out for companies trading at levels below what he believes they are intrinsically worth. That’s the very definition of value stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Let’s take a closer look at why Warren Buffett likely scooped up these three value stocks this past quarter.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'We live in an increasingly digital era where video and music streaming rule. Thus, many have left legacy radio stalwarts like Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) for dead. Its years of sluggish growth and an exodus of customers to trendier music platforms certainly don’t help its case. However, I believe the rumors of radio’s demise are greatly exaggerated. While Sirius faces secular decline risks, its fortunes appear to be turning around.', 'From my perspective, a resurgence in podcasting bodes very well for Sirius. Yes, podcasts are not radio per se, but they speak to a strong ongoing demand for audio content. Sirius happens to boast an unrivaled content library spanning exclusive artist channels, live sports, news, and more. As things considered, it offers a compelling, differentiated audio product. Sirius may be old, but not obsolete.', 'I believe Sirius will likely return to customer growth, especially with video streaming services facing password-sharing crackdowns. Churning video customers may opt for cheaper audio alternatives like Sirius. Notably, while revenue growth slowed over the years, Sirius has rapidly grown earnings. In my view, with costs well controlled, any revenue uptick should substantially boost profits.', 'The market seems to agree that Sirius possesses turnaround potential. Indeed, shares are already up 34% in the past six months as of this writing. Of course, this stock has only begun clawing back from a more than 40% drop in 2022. But at 15-times forward earnings, Sirius still trades at a steep discount to its historical levels, as well as its peers.

From my perspective, for a supposedly boring gas and electric utility play, PEG stock boasts exciting growth. Of course, serving the densely-populated Northeast U.S. gifts PEG a captive customer base, but management deserves credit for driving operations excellence and efficiency.', 'With interest rates remaining high, many avoid utility stocks, given their rate-sensitive business models. However, I think it’s different in this case, because so much of the company’s footprint operates under revenue decoupling mechanisms.

Accordingly, we’re seeing Verizon’s positive phone subscriber growth in years.', 'Moreover, Verizon’s cash cow wireless business throws off immense cash flows to support its generous dividend. Though unlikely to grow soon, I believe Verizon’s 7.1% dividend yield looks pretty safe at a 57.3% payout ratio.

The Bovespa index rose 0.3% in choppy trading and the real gained 0.4% against the dollar. Data showed Brazil\'s economy avoided contraction in the third quarter, growing by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in the three months through September instead of shrinking 0.2% as economists had expected.

More broadly, MSCI\'s basket of South American currencies was about flat against a stronger dollar.

The pesos of Colombia and Mexico reversed earlier losses to each rise about 0.4%. MSCI\'s index tracking Latin American stocks gained 0.3%, with Chilean stocks adding 1.4%. Mexico\'s benchmark index slipped 0.1%, Peru\'s Lima index was down 0.3%, while Colombia\'s Colcap dropped 0.4%. Argentina\'s benchmark stock index rose 4%, while the peso traded at 363 to the dollar on official markets. Libertarian Javier Milei assumes the presidency on Sunday, and some advisors have signaled the currency could drop 44% to around 650 pesos per dollar. BlackRock , the world\'s largest asset manager, said in its 2024 investment outlook it has a broad preference for emerging market assets over those in developed markets, adding it was bullish on India and Mexico.

His role within the company involves overseeing various strategic initiatives and operations, which gives him a deep understanding of the company's business and market position. Insider sales by high-ranking executives like Shah are closely monitored because they may signal their confidence in the company's current valuation and future performance."", ""Masco Corp is a global leader in the design, manufacture, and distribution of branded home improvement and building products. The company's portfolio includes a wide range of products such as faucets, cabinetry, architectural coatings, and other hardware-related items. Masco Corp's brands are recognized for their quality, innovation, and performance, which has allowed the company to establish a strong presence in both residential and commercial markets."", ""Insider transactions can be a valuable indicator of a company's internal perspective on its stock's value. Over the past year, Jai Shah has sold a total of 25,000 shares and has not made any purchases. This one-sided activity could suggest that insiders might believe the stock is fully valued or potentially overvalued at current levels."", ""When examining the broader insider transaction history for Masco Corp, we see a pattern of 18 insider sells and no insider buys over the past year. This trend could indicate that insiders are taking advantage of the stock's market performance to realize gains, or they may have concerns about the company's future growth prospects or market conditions."", ""On the day of Shah's recent sale, Masco Corp shares were trading at $62.38, giving the company a market cap of $13.98 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 16.90, which is higher than the industry median of 14.65 but lower than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that while the stock may be trading at a premium compared to its industry peers, it is still below its own historical valuation levels."", 'The price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.07 indicates that Masco Corp is Fairly Valued based on its GF Value. The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate that considers historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. A ratio close to 1 suggests that the stock is trading at a price that is in line with its intrinsic value.', 'However, it is important to note that insider selling does not always imply a lack of confidence in the company. Executives may sell shares for personal financial planning, diversification, or other non-company related reasons. Therefore, while insider sales can provide context, they should not be the sole factor in investment decisions.', 'The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the selling pattern over the past year. The absence of insider buys may raise questions among investors, but it is essential to consider the overall financial health and market conditions when interpreting these actions.', ""The GF Value image further illustrates the stock's valuation in relation to its intrinsic value. With the stock being Fairly Valued, it appears that the market has efficiently priced Masco Corp's shares, taking into account its historical performance and future growth expectations."", ""The recent insider sell by Group President Jai Shah of Masco Corp is a significant event that warrants attention. While the insider's actions may suggest a belief that the stock is adequately valued, investors should also consider the broader market context and the company's fundamentals before making any investment decisions. With Masco Corp's strong brand portfolio and market position, the company remains a key player in the home improvement and building products industry. However, as with any stock, it is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider a multitude of factors beyond insider transactions when evaluating its investment potential."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

With a flying speed of 470 knots, it is capable of performing multiple missions, including cargo and troop transport, medical evacuation, search and rescue, firefighting and humanitarian operations.Additionally, when equipped with air-to-air refueling capabilities, designated as KC-390, it has been proven successful in aerial refueling operations, both as a tanker and a receiver, enhancing its operational flexibility.Since operation, the C-390’s existing fleet has completed more than 10,800 flight hours, showcasing an operational availability of around 80% and mission completion rates exceeding 99%. This surely has been attracting more customers like South Korea to select C-390 as their choice of combat jet, thereby ushering in contract flows for Embraer.', 'As nations are ramping up their defense spending to strengthen their troop, the prospects for military aircraft have increased manifold, with the Asia-Pacific region dominating the market.

This unfolds immense opportunities for companies like Embraer that already have exposure in the region’s military aircraft market.In October 2023, Embraer participated in the ADEX 2023 in Seoul to display its defense and security products and solutions. In 2022, a number of MOUs were signed with Korean companies, like Aerospace Technology of Global, EM Korea Co. and Kencoa Aerospace, to supply parts for the C-390 Millennium in the future.', ""Apart from Embraer, other aircraft manufacturers that stand to gain from the enhancing Asia-Pacific military aircraft market are as follows:Boeing BA: It has a presence in the Republic of South Korea (ROK), India and Southeast Asia. Boeing has had a presence in Korea since 1950. The defense products supplied to ROK include the AH-64E Apache, F-15K Slam Eagle fighter jets, Peace Eye Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft etc. In July 2023, Boeing was awarded a contract to produce 47 CH-18F Chinooks for operation in South Korea.BA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies an improvement of 15.6% from the 2022 reported figure.Airbus EADSY: The Asia-Pacific region is one of Airbus' core markets. For military operations, more than 150 light and medium tactical aircraft (C212, CN235 and C295) are in service in the region. The A330 MRTT (multi-role tanker transport) has been used by Air Forces of Australia, Singapore and South Korea.EADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies an improvement of 12.9% from the 2022 reported figure.Lockheed Martin LMT: The company has a well-established presence in the Asia-Pacific region. LMT has been serving ROK for more than 30 years with its F-35 Lightning II, T-50 Golden Eagle, C-130 Hercules, Black Hawk etc. It also helps the Indian Air Force in advancing its defense capabilities. In March 2023, Lockheed signed a MOU with Tata Group for fighter wing production in India.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.6%.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 39% over the next three years.

The company's fair profitability and growth ranks indicate potential but also suggest the need for a thorough analysis of future prospects and financial health.

I'll now turn the call over to Doug."", 'Douglas Howe', ""Good morning, everyone.Thank you for joining us today. the third quarter was difficult for our business. Macro headwinds continue to impact us most acutely within our retail segment traffic as consumers remain under pressure and the overall footwear market contracted for the first time since the pandemic because our business is heavily weighted towards dress and seasonal, unseasonably warm weather also had an outsized impact on our top line. We also faced headwinds that we believe demonstrate our need to operate with even greater speed while increasing the level of innovation, newness and fashion in our assortments. To this end, we have made several strategic decisions regarding leadership across our organization, and we will be diligent as we embark on the journey of backfilling these roles in order to best position our business for the future.During our second quarter earnings call, we communicated that our full year guidance assumed we set at a key inflection point and a retail comp performance would need to meaningfully improve, supported by a strong September throughout the balance of the year. In order to meet our expectations, we also noted the possibility for headwinds to worsen further something that could hamper the sequential improvement we require during the third quarter, we experienced a sales shortfall within the fall season, specifically September, particularly related to broad-based weakness in seasonal and dress. Conversely, the casual portion of our retail business continued to perform well, delivering comp sales growth in the mid-single digits. We also see the retail customer continuing to lean into value and the intentional rebuild of our clearance business within our US retail segment helped to slightly offset broader declines. Clearance sales were down only 3%, significantly better than our total sales, which were down 9%. However, none of these were significant enough to offset the precipitous decreases we experienced in dress and more notably in boots within our retail segment, which includes DSW stores, Shoe Company and their related e-commerce site. Our top line fell short of our expectations, driven by seasonal product demand. Specifically boot demand falling meaningfully year over year. This was a dynamic felt industry-wide. We have long been a market leader in seasonal footwear, which is boots and sandals, and this continued to represent a material portion of our sales in Q3. According to circ on a third quarter, seasonal footwear was down 16% based on dollar sales over the last year in the total market, which was in line with our performance at DSW. However, while seasonal footwear represents about 20% of the total market in the third quarter, it represented nearly 40% of DSW's business, resulting in disproportionate pressure on our performance as we look across our entire assortment and continue to learn more about evolving consumer preferences in both category mix and shopping channels. We are adapting our own strategic approach. We know we can perform better across all categories, including nonseasonal and get back to our roots of being a product lead, data-driven merchant organization, quick to supply a product that meets the trends the customer is leaning into to that end. I am excited by the skilled and experienced merchant leadership we have brought to the business and Laura Danek, our newest President of DSW, will speak to strategic initiatives. Her team is pursuing shortly, we met our expectations in our Brand Portfolio segment with overall sales down 12.5%, in line with our expectations. Declines in our legacy brands. Wholesale business were offset by the additions of Keds, towboat and Hush Puppies as well as strong performance at ABC.com. We are building momentum and gaining traction across our brand portfolio as we continue to prioritize long-term sustainable growth within this segment.At the beginning of our brand-building journey, the portfolio we controlled was highly focused on dress and seasonal with significant whitespace opportunities in the casual and athleisure space, which drove us to make key acquisitions. Since that time, we have made notable progress, growing our portfolio and doubling the sales of our own brands across DBI.'s business continues to be central to our growth story moving forward. At telco specifically, we saw a sequential increase in the quarter and a significant improvement in our DTC. site throughput. In October, we launched three new shoes, including a new waterproof trail runner and new low top hiker. We also refreshed the ST. five, which pairs a minimally Christian zero drop platform with topo signature fit for a natural comfortable run experience and or workout session at the gym.I want to take a moment to thank our partners at REI., a key retail partner for us as we continue to expand our partnership and increase brand awareness for Turbo. Vince Camuto, the brand posted its highest demand day of 2023 in the quarter, as well as the largest full-price non-promotional day in DC.com history, spurred by the incredibly successful first-ever influencer collaboration with Dress Up butter cup a lifestyle brand by DD. red, who has over $1 million followers on Instagram to celebrate the launch influencers attended a branch in Nashville, Tennessee, helping to drive significant publicity as we look to expand our specialty size business, which Laura will speak to in a moment. This recent launch has given us yet another proof point that Wildcat boots are in high demand and given the limited options available that address this market, we will continue to provide new offerings to capture share another way we are strategically evolving our assortment and listening to our customers year over year VC. dot com comp sales were up 7% for the quarter. Importantly, Vince Camuto remains in an excellent position to expand the total addressable market for our own brands with significant opportunity in both men's and women's wide with shoes.Before I hand it over to Laura, I want to thank our team for their dedicated execution in this very challenging environment we are digging in, we will adapt, and I'm confident in our ability to navigate this backdrop and make progress on our long-term vision. Designer Brands is unlike any other company in the footwear industry. And I believe this unique model will allow us to grow our competitive edge as we aim to ride our business for the future.We continue to prioritize building out our leadership team with the right skill set to ensure our product focus aligns within our customers' preferences. As a first step, Laura has hit the ground running and has begun laying the groundwork for key strategic updates. To elaborate on some of these priorities for DSW, please join me in welcoming DSW's President, Laura Danek, Laura, thank you, Doug, and hello, everyone."", 'Laura Denk', ""It's an honor to speak with you all today. And my first 100 days, my priority has been to work closely with the management team and great associates at DBI. to learn ins and outs of the business. I've also talked of customers and national brand partners and visited many stores throughout the country. There is a universal passion for DSW, and it's been exciting to witness. The power of our brand has also been important to me to hear firsthand where the biggest issues and therefore, areas of opportunity are as I boil this down. I believe that while DSW is certainly feeling the brunt of a very pressured industry, there are elements of our business where we can employ more focus and discipline. According to STAR Kona, the total footwear market was down in the third quarter year over year. The first quarter has seen a decline since Q4 of 2020, but DSW's performance also lagged the overall market as they work to unpack why and what we need to prioritize. I'm intently focused on three key areas in the near term to drive improvement, one, reinvigorating our assortment to optimizing our market investments and three, enhancing our in-store and digital shopping experiences. First, our assortment at DSW and across all of designer brands. It starts and ends with product. We can't lose sight of how important an optimal and differentiated assortment is our assortment. The size of which was historically unparalleled is what made DSW, the dominant retailer it is today and maintaining an energizing and trend-right assortment is even more critical today. And the customer has substantially more options from brands that are moving more quickly than ever over the last few years, designer brands has contended with a number of unforeseen events, not the least of which included the COVID pandemic and subsequent recovery demand further complicated by global supply chain issues amidst these external challenges, we've also been focused on driving vertical integration internally with a number of these challenges now behind us and an evolved business model, I believe we can turn more of our focus to accelerating the alignment of our overall assortment more closely to what customers are demanding as it stands currently, we can do more to bring the hottest brand and the excitement that comes with them to DSW's assortments to reinforce a differentiated and relevant offerings.My vision for DSW's assortment is trend-right shoes that align with consumer demand, we need to get back to our heritage with a relentless flow of newness, key designer fines and creating SoMo in order to ensure we can maintain our position as a fashion footwear retailer. I have given our buyers a direction to maintain greater liquidity, listen to our consumers and seize opportunistic buys more tactically, I plan to leverage DSW's unique data and insights from our database of nearly 30 million loyalty members to identify trends and dynamically adjust our offerings and our marketing to provide a selection that resonates with evolving consumer preferences. This product-led data-driven assortment strategy brings back the passion and creativity that good merchants thrive on, including building strong and growing relationships with our national brand partners. We remain a sought-after partner for top national brands. Given our highly attractive customer base with our unparalleled access to the female athlete and the growing demand for athletic and athleisure product, these brands continue to prioritize placement in our channels. For example, Nike product began coming back online in September and as of early November is fully rolled out in all DBI. channels. Nike has instantly become one of our top national brands, both in stores and through our e-commerce site, and we couldn't be happier with this relationship. We are also pleased to see other national brands returning to DSW. And this spring, we plan to bring Under Armour back into our collection of high quality offerings. We're also excited for our dominant and growing relationships with Birkin stock and Skechers. And while the assortment must be relevant, we need to remind the consumer why DSW should be their preferred footwear retailer because we remain a leader in the industry, but in recent years has started to see DSW brand awareness at Road. We are still leading the footwear industry with our award winning VIP. program, which boasts nearly 30 million members. We have not been as diligent about one driving awareness among potential new customers and to communicate our continuously refreshed and renewed assortment and convenient shopping experience to our existing loyalty members. As such, I gain conviction that we must start investing again in top of funnel marketing and broad communications to grow the awareness that we are the best in shoes. As a first step in October, we significantly increased investment and top of funnel marketing, inclusive of an inspiring video campaign to reach over 75% of DSW's female target audience. While top-of-funnel marketing takes time to translate into tangible transactions today, early reads are encouraging that more simply having the right assortment is only half the battle DSW needs to continue to more loudly, articulate the variety and quality of our assortment to emphasize our unique position of footwear and remind the customer why they should choose DSW for all of their footwear needs.Finally, I also feel strongly that we must always be invest in our customer experience, including our store fleet. The customer has more choices than ever as to where and how to shop for footwear, and we must provide an experience as frictionless and easy to navigate. In addition to constantly evolving our digital and omni capabilities to improve conversion and engagement. We are looking across our store footprint and evaluating opportunities to selectively invest in refreshing this experience to stay modern, relevant and provide an experience that Internet pure plays cannot. We've taken a thoughtful customer first approach asking what is important to them and subsequently testing new approaches to certain aspects of the shopping experience. We are analyzing feedback from test stores in Houston, Columbus and Oregon and prioritizing those aspects, which will have the biggest impact. We are in the early stages on this, but the customer reaction has been encouraging, and we are excited to continue testing and learning. As we move forward. Our teams will continue to develop a holistic strategy that we'll lean into a fresh, exciting assortment, new marketing initiatives and refreshed in-store and digital experiences.Thank you again, Doug, for having me join the conversation today. And with this, I will turn the call over to Jared for an overview of our financial results."", 'Jared Poff', ""Jared Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. I want to reiterate Doug's comments as this is a difficult time for our business and the broader footwear industry. As he mentioned, the improvements that we were anticipating on both top and bottom line did not materialize. And the net risk position that I had called out on our last earnings call came to fruition. This quarter. The top line weakness ultimately flowed through leading to operating deleverage against a largely fixed expense base and resulted in an adjusted EPS of $0.24. Our team is aware of the factors that led to this situation and is making progress on sustainable improvements across all elements of the business based on what we have seen through the fourth quarter to date. We do not expect these sales pressures to alleviate as we wrap up this year, especially given the ongoing uncertainty in the macro environment.Let me provide a bit more detail on our Q3 financial results for the third quarter, sales decreased 9.1% from last year to $786.3 million. From a wholesale perspective, sales were down roughly 22.7% in line with expectations as we lapped strong wholesale sales unlocked by pent-up demand in that channel last year following supply chain disruptions, US retail comps specifically were down 9.8% in the quarter, while Canada posted comps down 7.7% in the quarter. One bright spot was our Vince Camuto.com business, one of our premier DTC channels with comps up 7% in the quarter on top of a 27% comp last year and up 26.3% for the month of October. This quarter's success was largely driven by the brand's decision to lean into strong consumer demand for wide and Extra Wide shafted boots. Consolidated gross margin was 32.6% in the third quarter compared to 33% last year, a decrease of 40 basis points, driven primarily by an increase in promotional pricing and the deleverage of our fixed store occupancy costs offset by lower freight and shipping costs. That being said, our gross margin continues to be fundamentally stronger than pre-pandemic with consolidated gross margin up 330 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019. And we will continue to look for ways to bring further efficiencies to our operating model. Our adjusted SG&A ratio for the third quarter was 28.9% of sales compared to 25.5% in the third quarter of 2022, driven primarily by deleverage from the top line pressures against an increasingly fixed expense base, along with an increase in marketing expense.As Laura mentioned, for the third quarter, adjusted operating profit was 4% of sales compared to 7.8% for the prior prior year quarter. In the third quarter, we had $8.8 million of net interest expense and our effective tax rate on our adjusted results was 34.6% compared to 25.9% last year. Finally, our third quarter adjusted net income was $14.8 million or $0.24 diluted EPS versus $46.1 million or $0.67 last year. We ended the third quarter with inventories of $601.5 million, down roughly 12% compared to $681.8 million last year and down sequentially from $606.8 million in the second quarter. On a retail inventory per square footage basis, we ended down 11.5% versus the third quarter of 2022. Wholesale inventory ended the third quarter, up 2% and adjusted for the acquisition of Turbo and kids, inventory would have been down roughly 20% when compared to last year. Headed into the fall, we were acutely aware of the net risk position we were facing. And as such, we were very strategic with our inventory investments. We continue to remain nimble in our approach to our assortment as we prioritize maintaining a healthy inventory position, we strategically deployed promotions for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which helped to drive traffic in stores and online. While the current environment is operationally challenging. Our strong and steady cash flow generation and liquidity remain a bright spot. Year to date through Q3, we have generated approximately $203 million of net cash provided by operating activities compared to $38 million during the same period last year and the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We also returned $82.5 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases year to date, that is a total of $111.5 million. In addition to generating meaningful cash flow from operating activities we further bolstered our liquidity position by arranging for a term loan in the second quarter. This action has given us ample liquidity to manage through turbulent times like this, while also allowing us to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases, something that we believe showcases our conviction and DBI.'s long-term strategy. We ended the quarter in a solid liquidity position with $54.6 million of cash and our total liquidity, which includes cash and availability under our revolver of $267.9 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had $213.3 million available to draw on our revolving credit facility on October 31, 2023, we borrowed $25 million of the $85 million available under our new term loan with any remaining delayed draw loans to be taken by January 31 of 2024. We remain well inside of all covenants and have strong relationships with all of our credit providers. Total debt outstanding was $375.5 million as of the end of the quarter. We continue to await the receipt of our remaining 40 million of our CARES Act tax refund due to us from the IRS. As a reminder, the IRS has formally closed our standard audit for which this refund applies with no adjustments. And as such, we are now simply waiting on the refund request to work its way through the approved appropriate approval channels at the IRS and TREASURY DEPARTMENT for ultimate funding. Given the quarter's results, we are addressing our full year outlook. We are now planning for DBI. net sales to be down high single digits, with retail comps also down high single digits for the year, implying DBI. net sales to be flat to down low single digits for the fourth quarter when taking into account the 53rd week. While we don't anticipate, we will see the demand that we lost in September boot sales materialize in the fourth quarter, we will remain in a competitive posture to keep our inventory at an appropriate level in order to do so. Higher promotions will continue to be necessary. This all results in expected adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $0.4 to $0.7. The change in this revised adjusted EPS expectation is a substantially larger percentage change than the change in top line expectations as a result of a highly fixed expense base, which is anticipated to come in as originally communicated, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding are anticipated to be approximately $57 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $64 million for the fiscal year. Given the share repurchase activity that has occurred thus far throughout the year. With this, we are immediately taking actions dog and Laura mentioned to address the top line issues that are unique to us and believe we have identified areas that will yield meaningful results in the future for DSW. We have also discussed these the changes we are making in our Brand Portfolio segment, including finding an experienced and seasoned leader to run this business and anticipate outsized growth from this part of our business as we look across our longer-term horizon. And as always, we will be looking for ways to bring further efficiencies to our operating model moving forward, including efficiencies in operating expenses and interest expense. This will take time and we anticipate that our current fixed expense structure will continue to result in operating deleverage in Q4. As Doug noted, we are laser focused on accelerating our ongoing strategies that are working and tactically addressing areas of the business that are not performing as desired. While our results were disappointing, our team is more energized than ever to build solutions towards a more resilient and dynamic enterprise model.With that, I would like to turn to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', 'Operator, we will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question. You may press star then one on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw from the question queue, please press star then two. First question is from Gabby Carbone of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.', 'Gabby Carbone', ""I think so much for taking my question. So I just wanted to dig in on your brand awareness comments. You mentioned that's eroded a bit. Maybe if you dig a little further into the investments you're making to bring the customer back to the store, do you think your target customer has changed at all? And then maybe how should we be thinking about the impact from that top of funnel marketing you mentioned on kind of SG&A moving ahead?"", 'Douglas Howe', ""Thank you.Good morning, Gary, this is Doug.Thanks for your question?Yes.As we talked about, we invested in top-of-funnel marketing, which was episodic video in the quarter. As you know, those take time to be able to measure the impact of that. We are encouraged by those initial results, and it's something that we'll continue to lean into on as we move into Q1 and beyond. I don't know that our customer has changed dramatically other than just the continued strength of the penetration of the casual and the athletic area, which we have been leaning into obviously on. But we wanted to do that just based on the fact that we did see a erosion in kind of our awareness. And so we wanted to continue to make sure that we were increasing our overall customer file as we move forward. We're still working through on next year with regard to balance of top of funnel marketing as well as performance marketing. And just knowing that there's a latency impact, obviously top of funnel investment."", 'Gabby Carbone', 'Got it.And then just a follow up, I wanted to dig into casual athletic a bit more. I think you mentioned last quarter that Nike came in about a month earlier than you originally planned. Maybe just how does the flow of Nike product transpire? How has the customer response been? And then has your other athletic kind of inventory competition changed at all with taking on more Nike product?', 'Douglas Howe', ""Yes, great question. Thank you. Obviously, we're very pleased with the initial Nike results on pure content and the product did come in a little bit earlier than we originally anticipated, which was originally planned for Q4. And so it was about midway through the quarter where it started to flow in the initial reaction has been quite strong within the first few weeks. It's on we now become one of our top five brands handily, and it still represented just a little over 1% of sales for the quarter, obviously. So we're still ramping up. And, you know, in historical times that was between 7% and 8%. So very encouraged by initial results.As we move through Q4, we continued to see really strong momentum in the overall athletic category, which again, is part of our strategy as we tried to de seasonalized our business moving forward."", 'Jared Poff', ""And then Gaby, one thing I would add, and I think we've talked about this as well. In addition to the Nike product itself that we're very excited to see resonate with the customer. We also feel that the loss of Nike's certainly impacted other brands and that people would find their way into DSW through Google searching or some other way of the Nike brand and ended up buying somewhere else. Hard to quantify the exact impact of that. But we definitely think that that was a drag on our overall digital demand after we lost Nike across other brands. So we've been seeing that also come back. It will take time and the algorithms have to pick it up and bring you back to the top, but we're excited for what that might mean as well."", 'Gabby Carbone', 'Great.Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'Again, if you have a question, please press star then one next question comes from Jay Sole of UBS.Please go ahead.', 'Jay Sole', ""Super, thank you so much. And you mentioned that you expect some of these macro pressures to persist for a while. You obviously don't have a crystal ball and I would expect that. But you what would you think the macro pressures might alleviate some of this glass into first half of next year?Or I mean, how do you think about it?"", 'Douglas Howe', ""P.j., this is Doug.Thanks for your question.Yes, your point we don't have a crystal ball. I would say kind of what we're seeing in Q4, which we've incorporated in our guidance is consistent with what we saw in Q3. There definitely was an outsized impact. We saw, obviously, in seasonal. We think partially attributable to warmer weather as we move into spring and that pivots into sandals.Obviously, our assortment dramatically changes.And we also we're seeing, like I said, buoyancy with the athletic trend and we're being very opportunistic and chase into inventory there to take advantage of what the customers are looking for. Having said that, I would say on customers continue to be very choosy and very selective with regards to discretionary purchases. And I think our clearance trend kind of indicates the fact that customers are still looking for value. That's always been a core strength of specifically DSW. We'll continue to lean into that on, but we're conservatively planning it and we'll be in a position to react and reacting to it real time."", 'Jay Sole', ""Got it.And maybe, Doug, just to put a finer point on it, can you just talk a little bit about how the sales trended, say the week before the Thanksgiving weekend and then obviously through Cyber Monday, how sales trended and what you've seen sort of since then the week post that, I mean, did you see that spike? And then like last week as it had been noted normalization back to the sales growth rates that you saw for or you give us maybe a little bit color around that, that would be helpful."", 'Douglas Howe', ""Sure.Yes.Thanks for your question. We were very promotional because we wanted to make sure that we didn't lose share specifically as we went into that Cyber Week. And so we were very aggressive on promotions.We did see a nice performance there.And so again, you know, kind of mission accomplished with regard to not losing share.

So we're very encouraged by that. Again, small businesses overall, but we're definitely encouraged by what we saw and the plans that we have going forward for those brands in particular.And then on Eliquis Grab, we launched that at DSW as part of our opportunity obviously to expand encouraged by initial results there as well. So again, early days going through, obviously the integration, but we're optimistic about those."", 'Jay Sole', 'Got it.

Let's take a look at one of the other big headlines that we're following this morning. And more trouble for China. Moody's cutting its credit outlook for the world's second largest economy to negative from stable, citing worries about rising debt levels, persistently lower medium-term economic growth, as well as the downward spiral of its property sector."", ""Now, of course, this isn't too surprising maybe given that China's post-COVID recovery has been rocky, to say the least, with issues like a weakened consumer and high unemployment rate among young people impacting the recovery story there. It has also had an impact on some US companies with heavy exposure to China. And we have our very own Madison Mills here to discuss this."", ""And, guys, we're taking a look at this from a specific companies that are really at risk, when you talk about the slowdown that's happening right now with China. Maddie, I know you're taking a look here at some of those consumer facing names and specifically what's going on with some of these retailers."", ""MADISON MILLS: Yeah, I want to talk about Nike and LVMH to start things off. We know that the China story has come up a lot in their earnings calls, specifically here starting with Nike. In their most recent earnings, a little bit stronger of a report when it comes to the China story. With a brand like Nike, they're so big here in the United States. They've got to look to some of these emerging markets to continue to have that growth that the Street is going to be looking for on their earnings."", ""But as we've talked about many times, guys, this China story has not had the rebound of their economy that the Street has been looking for and that brands like Nike have been looking for. That might be one reason that we've seen the CEO visiting several times over the past six months."", ""And that's also why this downgrade, when you think about the earnings stories that we've been covering, it might make sense to some investors, right? Because we've seen this slowdown and this push for more stimulus. We have seen some stimulus to these local governments, as Beijing does push for a little bit more of this recovery."", ""They're looking to double their GDP by 2035, guys. And so potentially this downgrade might be a push to Beijing for more of that stimulus, which could potentially be a boon for some of these consumer names."", ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we're going to be looking as well at Tesla here. You've been keeping an eye on this one and what could mean for the automotive sector."", ""SEANA SMITH: And a lot of it ties back to what Maddie was just saying just in terms of the weak consumer right now. People thinking twice before making those purchases. And when it comes to LVMH, you can categorize a lot of those purchases are pretty big purchases. Buying a car is a huge purchase. And we're starting to see the fact that the recovery has been much slower than maybe initially anticipated. Has started to weigh on Tesla's results."", ""And we're just getting out here this week, the latest data when it comes to sales in China. And this was out from the-- let's see here-- when it comes to the sales falling just about 18% in November. The recent data from the China Passenger Car Association. So falling nearly 18% in November on a year over year basis."", ""Why this is so significant is that we know Tesla needs China to be successful in terms of their sales there to really drive some of that market share, drive some of their revenue, their gains and going forward. They get about 20%, and that has historically been about 15%, 20% of the revenue relies on Asia. So the fact that they are so heavily reliant on one region of the world obviously really points to the fact that we are seeing any material weakness there. It's a little bit worrisome for Musk and for the company."", 'We know Elon Musk recently paid a lot to sit down and speak with Xi Jinping at APAC not too long ago. So we know that he has been really driving some of the pricing war that has been playing out over in China, very focused on the region, doing everything they can to boost sales there.', ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah. I've got two names that I'm looking at with regard to this and the Moody's cut out of China here specifically. I'm going to go unsexy and then we'll go sexy with Apple. The unsexy one, which, I mean, for a lot of construction files out there, Caterpillar is still pretty sexy. But at the end of the day, you're taking a look at the pre-market move. It's down by about 3/10 of a percent."", ""Moody's actually expects the property sector to remain smaller in proportion to the entire economy than it was before the property correction that started in 2021. As a result here, this could directly impact construction here, and especially when you look at the different markers of land sales revenue that accounted ultimately for about 37% of their revenue, excluding transfers from some of the central government there in 2022."", ""But at the end of the day, the land sales, the construction on top of those land sales as well and what this means more notably for some of that commercial property where the development is set to take place that could directly impact a company like Caterpillar that's already seen some weakness in its construction industries. In the most recent quarter, you saw a move lower by about 8% in that construction industry segment here."", ""So that's one area that I'm going to be watching. I'm also going to be watching closely Apple. Any time you hear for a call like this, and for Moody's what they're essentially looking at in the consumer profile within this region, they're looking at disposable income as well. Now, of course, you might be thinking, well, I need my smartphone. I sleep next to it every night, as anybody around the world probably does."", ""But at the end of the day, the propensity to upgrade your phone becomes less likely if you're taking a look at some of those household expenditures in this region and saying, all right, well, why would a consumer want to spend up or want to get at least the higher models that are out there and introduced into the market most recently in September, and now making their way into hands and phones and, perhaps, your bed as well in these past few weeks and months here. So Apple is one that I would also be keeping a close eye on."", ""IDC had projected that they were going to see their highest market share at about 19.9% by the end of the year for their operating system here internationally. And so this call from Moody's certainly puts that perhaps back in focus for some investors."", ""SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it does. And I think it's almost across the board, right? We can sit here and list a long, long list of companies that have heavy exposure to China. We didn't get a chance to talk about Starbucks, we didn't get a chance to talk about a lot of these consumer facing names that they have focused their growth plans on this region. The fact that this recovery has been so slow, it could be a real hurdle, at least in the short term."", ""BRAD SMITH: That's bad news for the brand of the green siren at the end of the day perhaps here. We're going to be watching. Maddie, thanks so much for taking the time joining us here this morning to break this all down.""]"

Gen. Ken Paxton has his fingerprints on it.', 'Sure enough, here comes Paxton with a lawsuit charging Pfizer Inc. with systematically misrepresenting the efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine and attempting to censor public discussion about it.', '""The COVID vaccines are the miracle that wasn\'t,"" Paxton states in the very first line of the lawsuit, filed Nov. 30 in state court in Lubbock. ""Placing their trust in Pfizer, hundreds of millions of Americans lined up to receive the vaccine.... However, the pandemic did not end; it got worse.""', ""There's a lot of misinformation and disinformation packed into the 54 pages of Paxton's legal complaint, some of it so nonsensical as to evoke laughter, starting with the fact that the reasons the pandemic got worse after the introduction of COVID vaccines had more to do with policies promoted by Paxton and his political cronies than with Pfizer."", ""But let's quickly dispose with the underlying theme of Paxton's lawsuit, which is that the vaccines don't work."", ""The COVID vaccines are the miracle that wasn't."", 'Texas Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton', 'The Health and Human Services Department of the State of Texas itself refutes that assertion. Its website documents that at every stage of the pandemic and among every age group, vaccinated Texans experienced massively lower death rates from COVID than the unvaccinated.', 'In late January 2022, during the devastating Omicron wave, for instance, the COVID death rate in Texas was nearly 805 per 100,000 residents among the unvaccinated. Among those who had received the recently released bivalent booster vaccine, it was zero. In late April, the latest period surveyed, the death rate among the unvaccinated was 23 per 100,000; among the fully vaccinated it was 1.83.', ""Those figures match the findings of countless other studies of the vaccines' effectiveness. A year ago, after the vaccines had been available for two years, the Commonwealth Fund calculated that they had prevented more than 18.5 million hospitalizations and more than 3 million deaths in the U.S. That saved the U.S. about $1.15 trillion in healthcare costs that would otherwise have been incurred, the fund estimated."", ""What's Paxton's purpose in challenging this reality? It would take a triumph of metaphysics to pry into his soul, but it's fair to conjecture that he's trying to maintain his extreme right-wing cred after his near-career-death experience in September. That's when his Republican colleagues in the state Senate narrowly acquitted him of the corruption and bribery charges on which he had been impeached by the Republican-controlled Texas house in May."", ""You can't say that Paxton doesn't know his audience. Polls show that Republicans, self-identified conservatives and the less educated have all been overrepresented among vaccine resisters, in part because of campaigns against vaccines and vaccine mandates promoted by politicians such as Paxton."", 'In July 2021, when the Biden administration was trying to impose a vaccine mandate on employees of the federal government and of federal contractors, Paxton was quoted responding, ""Not on my watch!"" That October, he sued to block the mandates.', ""In general terms, Paxton's claim that the vaccines are ineffective, even dangerous, dovetails neatly with themes parroted falsely by such luminaries of the extreme right as Arizona's Kari Lake, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo — all of which have been conclusively refuted."", 'These claims are no laughing matter, however. They undermine confidence in vaccines against all vaccine-preventable diseases — measles and polio, among others — threatening the health of tens of millions of children and adults.', ""Paxton's immediate target is Pfizer, but his broader targets are the mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna, which are the leading COVID vaccines in the U.S. and much of the rest of the developed world."", ""He also takes shots at the Food and Drug Administration, suggesting that the FDA improperly approved the vaccines for distribution. It should be remembered that the FDA, America's premier regulator of drugs and medical devices, has long been a target of anti-regulation conservatives, including Johnson."", ""So let's take a closer look at Paxton's case."", 'At its heart is a ginned-up controversy over Pfizer\'s claim that its COVID vaccine is 95% effective against COVID. Paxton complains that that\'s a measure of the vaccine\'s reduction of ""relative risk,"" when it should be citing ""absolute risk.""', 'Read more: Column: Scientists are paying a huge personal price in the lonely fight against anti-vaxxers', ""These are abstruse notions for laypersons, so here's an explanation. (Beth Mole of Ars Technica, a microbiologist, is very good on this topic.) Put simply, when risk is fairly low, absolute risk calculations yield low numbers. Anti-vaxxers like that, because it minimizes the perception of a vaccine's efficacy. Relative risk, however, arguably provides a better window into a treatment's effectiveness."", 'For its key clinical trial of its COVID vaccine in November 2020, Pfizer divided test subjects into two groups of about 17,500 people each. One group got the vaccine, the other got a placebo. None had shown evidence of a prior COVID infection.', 'Of the placebo group, 162 of the 17,511 subjects got COVID. Only eight of the 17,411 members of the vaccinated group got COVID. The relative risk calculation is 162 minus eight, divided by 162 and expressed as a percentage. That answers the question of how much less is a vaccinated person likely to contract COVID than an unvaccinated subject, and the answer is 95% less.', 'Absolute risk is much lower, because the original risk is fairly low — of the vaccinated group, 0.046% got COVID; of the unvaccinated group, about 0.9% did.', 'Paxton\'s argument is that Pfizer should have claimed only a 0.86% risk reduction rate. But that\'s absurd. As Mole points out, the absolute risk of an infectious disease can vary widely based on circumstance. ""A person\'s absolute risk of flu drops significantly when it\'s not flu season,"" she writes. The absolute risk of COVID declined precipitately during lockdowns, and rose when people went out into the world again.', ""The question relevant for vaccines is how they worked for different people in the same situation — and that's relative risk. Pfizer's figures suggested that for everyone in a lockdown, the vaccine would reduce the severity of infection by 95%; the same for everyone out in the world."", 'Paxton asserts that Pfizer\'s 95% claim ""created the false impression that 95% of vaccine recipients would never obtain COVID-19, full stop.""', 'Read more: Column: Does Ron DeSantis even believe his dangerous B.S. about COVID vaccines? ', ""If that's so, it's a flaw in our system of scientific reporting, perhaps because journalists writing about these results didn't know the significance of relative versus absolute risk reduction. But it was certainly well understood in the scientific community and at the FDA, which had all the data at hand and knows how to do the math."", 'Paxton also advances a long-debunked claim that the COVID vaccines actually increase the likelihood of contracting the disease. His argument here rises from a combination of sheer ignorance — if not deliberate misrepresentation — and flagrant cherry-picking.', 'One of his sources is a post that appeared on an online contrarian website last year and was widely reprinted, but that grossly misinterpreted an article in the New England Journal of Medicine about the effect of vaccination on children.', ""The post claimed that the NEJM article showed that vaccination increased children's susceptibility to COVID, but that was wrong, as the author of the NEJM article made clear. In fact, the article showed only that the immunity conferred by the vaccine waned over time, which pointed to the conclusion not that vaccines are a health hazard for children, but just the opposite — that they should receive booster vaccines."", 'Paxton\'s second source is a study of COVID death rates in Scotland that, he says, ""demonstrate negative vaccine efficacy."" For example, the data show that the age-adjusted death rate from COVID in the third week of December 2021 was 1.69 per 100,000 among the unvaccinated, but 6.55 per 100,00 among those with two doses of vaccine.', ""That's true, but incomplete. In that week, the age-adjusted death rate among those with a booster or three doses was 0.33. And by the second week of January 2022, the rate among the unvaccinated was 10.4 per 100,000, but for those with booster shots or three doses it was only 1.5. In other words, Scotland's survey irrefutably demonstrated that the vaccines worked, not the opposite."", ""The danger in Paxton's campaign against Pfizer is that it only amplifies anti-vaccination sentiment that is spreading alarmingly around the country, especially in red states and conservative communities."", ""Vaccination is the quintessential medical intervention that benefits not only the vaccinated individuals but all those around them — family, friends, co-workers and employees of the services that can't avoid contact with others. It's the sine qua non of public-spirited medical options, and it's our shame and misfortune that it has been redefined by the Paxtons of this world as a strictly personal choice."", 'Get the latest from Michael HiltzikCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.Sign me up.', 'This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.']"

Importantly, patients were able to utilize standard dose reductions to manage neutropenia and remain on treatment.”', 'Additional Abstracts Presented at SABCS', 'Together, Arvinas and Pfizer will share five additional abstracts at SABCS, including a vepdegestrant monotherapy VERITAC Phase 2 dose expansion update, a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model evaluating the optimal dosing of palbociclib in combination with vepdegestrant, and three additional Trial in Progress abstracts.', 'The VERITAC Phase 2 monotherapy dose expansion of the ARV-471-mBC-101 study analyzed the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of vepdegestrant amongst 35 heavily pre-treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer. This update includes 12 months of additional follow-up data, and the tolerability and efficacy profile remained largely consistent with previous data disclosures.', 'In the PK/PD model simulation, a 100 mg dose of palbociclib in combination with vepdegestrant produced similar incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and comparable average palbociclib exposure compared to historical reference.', 'Titles for the five additional abstracts are listed here.', 'Investor Call & Webcast Details', 'A conference call and webcast will be held with executives from Arvinas and Pfizer to discuss the data presented at SABCS.

In July 2021, Arvinas announced a global collaboration with Pfizer for the co-development and co-commercialization of vepdegestrant; Arvinas and Pfizer will equally share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses, and profits. Ongoing and planned clinical trials will continue to monitor and evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of vepdegestrant.', 'About ArvinasArvinas is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to improving the lives of patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases through the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapies that degrade disease-causing proteins.

Specifically, the period between 2020 and 2021 posed substantial challenges for both payers and providers. Despite these difficulties, there was an uninterrupted momentum of innovation and expansion within healthcare services. Innovation remained a driving force, leading to the introduction of new technologies, telemedicine expansion, and novel treatment approaches. These advancements and innovations have left analysts feeling optimistic about its future prospects. Portfolio Managers at Janus Henderson Investors, Andy Acker and Dan Lyons are optimistic about this situation, suggesting it sets the stage for a promising outlook in the healthcare sector. They mentioned that healthcare is heading into the new year with lower valuations after a period of underperformance.

Small and mid-sized biotech company stocks experienced significant drops in value in 2021 and 2022. This decline happened as long-term growth investments, including biotech, were affected by the increase in 10-year Treasury bond yields during 2023. The report further highlighted that the S&P Biotechnology Industry Index, which measures the performance of big biotech companies within the S&P 500 Index, is currently trading at almost a 25% lower value compared to its average over the past 30 years. Additionally, the count of early-stage biotech companies trading at a value less than the cash they hold reached an all-time high in October.', 'Healthcare spending in the US has historically been one of the highest among developed countries.

This spending is double what other wealthy countries typically put towards healthcare. The report further mentioned that in 2022, the total earnings of the nine largest intermediaries, known as ""big health,"" reached about 45% of the US healthcare expenses, significantly increasing from 25% in 2013.

Established start-ups attracted huge funding, with four of the largest deals in the 2000s closing last year. Key players in hardware also received hefty investments, contributing to the industry's capital-intensive nature."", 'Despite the increased funding, the rate of new start-up creation slowed, with only 19 quantum technology start-ups founded in 2022 compared to 41 in 2021. This suggests that more investments are flowing into established companies than new ventures. Established companies have been the focus of large deals, particularly in hardware. The public sector also continued its commitment, with the US investing an additional $1.8 billion, the EU committing $1.2 billion, and Canada contributing $100 million.

This alliance consists of over 50 large corporations, start-ups, and universities around the world. IBM Research Head Dario Gil joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the details of this group and what more to expect when advocating for artificial intelligence development.', 'Gil believes that a large set of AI players is showing a “better way to create and shape and govern AI.” Gil insists that when there is only a select group leading the AI dialogue, revenue sharing is less plausible and there are more risks of “derailment” when challenges arise.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Should the future of AI development be open or closed? And what does that even mean? What are the implications of each model? tech giants, Meta and IBM, among others, have formed the AI Alliance, bringing together over 50 artificial intelligence companies and academic institutions, aiming to push a more open model of AI.', ""Dario Gil, IBM's Senior Vice President and Director of Research, joins us now. So, Dario, I think we all in theory kind of what open versus closed means, but there has been so much discussion over this as of late, and the sort of ethical and real-world considerations. Can you just sort of give us-- start by giving us a primer here, as what we mean when we are talking about open and closed systems with regards to AI?"", 'DARIO GIL: So, look, I think the first thing I would say is just to draw some parallels of transformative technologies that were built with open technologies, the internet, Linux, which is the underlying operating system that powers the world of enterprises, and and now AI. And what we mean by that is that they can be both a collection of methodologies, tooling, software frameworks, models. But that can be built with open technologies, number one.', ""And meaning sharing with each other in ways that we can all write code and share it with one another. But also open in this context is also a commitment to support education, and research, and publications in this space, which frankly has been the underpinning of all the progress that we've also witnessed in the world of AI. So it reflects a reality. And this is an incredibly diverse set of institutions that have come together to say, hey, this is the way we've been working. This is the way we want to double down, And this is the way that the future of AI should evolve."", ""- We've seen a lot of boardroom drama over the last few weeks, specifically with OpenAI and the attempted ousting of Sam Altman, and also welcoming him back in. But originally, OpenAI was structured as a non-profit, and the profitable arm of it just kind of grew. I'm just wondering, what do you make of this and what does this mean for the industry, this one particular example where it seems like there's already a big straying from the original intent, in certain respects, with respect to OpenAI and specifically for-profit ambitions here, revenue sharing, for example?"", 'DARIO GIL: So, look, one of the powers of having an incredibly diverse and healthy open innovation ecosystem is that there are no single points of failure. So independent on how well any given institution, including us, do, when you have a rich community that is contributing and is healthy no individual problems can derail the progress. And I think that, is in contrast, if you end up with a very, like, closed or very small set of players and a narrative that gets created around that, that is the future of AI.', ""So what this group, that includes some of the world's leading universities, that include startups, large companies, science agencies, and so on, internationally, by the way, vindicate is the fact that in aggregate, which is a group that's spending over $80 billion a year in R&D, that is educating over 400,000 students a year, and employs over a million people, what they're saying is, look, there's a different way that AI can evolve that doesn't have to be linked to all this drama that happens behind closed doors. And that there there's a better way to actually create, and shape, and govern AI."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Dario, I think that people-- we hear these sort of grand pronouncements about warnings over AI, right? Specifically, what are the concerns, what are the possibilities, what are the risks of AI without this openness and without guardrails?', ""DARIO GIL: So, look, on the one aspect of it, a concern would be that you have hyper-concentration of who gets to aggregate and create value and shape the destiny of a technology that is so profound for all of society. What this model defends is that there needs to be opportunities everywhere. And that means across our country in the United States, but also across the world, and that many players will create wealth, and participate, and enable this robust ecosystem. So that's statement number one. And a risk on the other one is hyper-concentration."", ""And then, there is legitimate debates as to the nature and the implications of both the use cases of AI and the safety and how we benchmark and test the technology that we create. But on that second category, good, open innovation ecosystem makes things safer. And the reason for that is that you have many more stakeholders and talent that actually can solve problems together. And we've seen this in cybersecurity, we've seen that in the world of cryptography, we've seen it in the world of operating systems. And that is what needs to happen in AI as well."", 'And we also wanted to involve some of the best researchers across universities and science agencies to continue to address the limitations that we see in AI, but have an optimistic view as to what can happen if we have true diversity of institutions.', ""JULIE HYMAN: And Dario, finally, I think, at least, the perception in the market, and that's usually what we're talking about here at Yahoo Finance, is that, to put it plainly, IBM has been a little bit left behind in the latest AI push, right? When the conversation centering around the likes of Microsoft, the likes of Alphabet. OpenAI, obviously, a part of that conversation. Does this help you guys sort of catch up, at least, in the zeitgeist with that AI conversation?"", ""DARIO GIL: Well, it's important for us. And the first thing I would highlight is that it's a new IBM, we launched this year. Watsonx, the new generative AI platform for business, and to incredible reaction. We built around foundation models. We built a governance framework around that. So there's incredible momentum. We're commercializing R&D faster than ever. So I've never been more optimistic than in my 20 years I've been IBM, to the rate and pace at which we're commercializing technology."", 'But to address your point is that on top of that, we absolutely believe that by tapping and working together with this incredible set of institutions, we can accelerate the pace at with which we innovate. And also, together, shape the direction of AI in ways that is more reflective to the reality of how they feel is evolving.', 'And the debates on times where we hyper-concentrate the discussion of just a few players, we hope that this provides a lot of clarity that there is a different reality and that, for the world of business, that they believe on one fundamental point that the future of AI will be shaped by open innovation and to bet on it.', '- All right, we have to leave it there, but really appreciate your insights here.

The computerized tariff services operate on a variety of computer systems from as small as the IBM System/34 and Univac 90/30 for stand-alone systems to as large as dual IBM System/370-168 computers for time-share systems. There were still batch systems operating on elderly IBM System/360 computers.', '', 'There are several basic approaches to developing computerized tariff systems. These vary in terms of carrier or shipper orientation, the basic software/hardware configuration, the level of automation, and the scope of service.', 'All of the rate retrieval systems are carrier-oriented in that they provide complete tariff information about all the commodities within a given tariff. Carriers are interested in knowing the rates their competitors are charging for every commodity in their tariffs. Shippers are interested only in rate data for the specific commodities they export, but\xa0 they want the data from all the tariffs they use. The voluminous carrier-oriented files combined with the sophisticated retrieval and rating routines required by shippers could lead to expensive systems without significant cost advantages to either shippers or carriers.', 'Generally, the rate retrieval systems are configured about one or more large mainframe computers. Access may be in either interactive (real-time) or batch mode.', 'Levels of automation and thus scope of service vary between systems. All existing systems, however, require skilled tariff analysts to identify the correct tariff, access the correct bill of lading classification, retrieve the associated rate and information, and calculate the shipment charge.', 'The interactive systems have four basic software characteristics, with increasing automation and service:', 'Word processing systems;', 'Word processing systems with keyword access capability;', 'Condensed databases with custom software; and', 'Condensed databases with new database techniques.', 'The most widespread and least automated approach stores and retrieves tariff data in a word processing system environment. The total tariff page is usually stored, complete with punctuation, without regard to specific data fields. The word processing environment requires large storage capacity, and the systems in place operate on large IBM mainframes with extensive disk storage.', 'Since it does not fully automate the retrieval function, it still requires interaction by a rate clerk to select the desired tariff and the correct bill of lading classification for each shipment. It does, however, provide electronic access by computer terminal to a tariff page, which eliminates a great deal of the library function and of the associated paper handling on the part of the subscriber. Not only do automated tariff users have faster access to rates, but they realize cost savings through the elimination of tariff subscriptions and the subsequent manual filing and retrieval costs.', 'More sophisticated word processing software can recognize keywords, which permits commodity access by generic terminology as well as by tariff item number. Generic access allows users to retrieve all tariff items that comply with specific naming conventions.', 'For example, the software can recognize the word “resin” and return all tariff items in a specific tariff using that word in the bill of lading classification. One approach to developing a tariff retrieval system in a word processing environment is being considered by a large publishing company that is evaluating the development of a tariff system utilizing sophisticated typesetting and retrieval software already in-house. This system could also operate on a large IBM mainframe.', 'A further enhancement of the word processing environment could build a database of only rates, surcharges, and pertinent rules that can be accessed by tariff item number. This enhancement reduces the storage requirements and speeds retrieval but has the same limitations of the word processing environment, vis-a-vis automation. There is little advantage — only in the reduction of time (and cost) — in substituting an electronic library for a paper library.', 'While these word processor systems fall short of the shipper requirements, they offer opportunities to carriers who wish to have electronic access to their own and their competitors’ complete tariff data and who are not so concerned with automation.', 'One benefit of the word processing approach to carriers and conferences is the electronic tariff page mailing service provided by Computerized Shipping Services Inc. utilizing Microcom microcomputers and a sophisticated printer at the offices of the Federal Maritime Commission. However, even this excellent approach to a segment of tariff automation is stifled short of its natural and beneficial goal by the manual filing system of the Federal Maritime Commission. The benefits of electronic mail are not matched by electronic filing at FMC.', 'Manalytics evaluated small proprietary tariff systems managed by custom software. There was little potential for expanding these systems since the custom programs severely limited growth. Implementing a new tariff database system of the magnitude required by a full range of tariff users was economically unfeasible using custom software.', 'The only economical approach was to base the system upon modern sophisticated database management software available from any one of a number of vendors.', 'Recently, the TRG, Washington Group, has converted their manual tariff-watching service to a computer using this approach. Today, TRG offers an electronic tariff surveillance service, which can be accessed by computer terminals anywhere in the world.', 'Major transpacific import and export tariffs are currently electronically available, and additional tariffs are being added on a trade-by-trade basis. Manalytics observed the system in operation at the offices of a major transpacific carrier and found it a valuable tool for the carrier to conduct rate analysis of his and competing carriers’ base rates and surcharges. The TRG system is operating at a time-sharing facility using dual IBM System 370/168 computers. The database management software is called ADABAS.', 'Shippers require a database of rates, surcharges, and pertinent rules. However, they require more sophisticated access to allow retrieval by computer terminal operators unskilled in either tariff analysis or computer operation. They need automated rating, not just rate retrieval. Further, some shippers require access by their in-house computers.', 'The approach was to develop a procedure by which the tariff rate and pertinent charges could be retrieved by the shipper’s product codes. In other words, the computer terminal operator or the retrieving computer itself would have to know only his own familiar internal product code to access the correct bill of lading classification in any tariff between a given origin and a given destination.', 'Skilled rate people would still be required in the operation, but only at managerial levels to control the linkage between product code and tariff classification. The shippers require secure control of this linkage and the exclusive right to change the linkage between a specific product code and a specific classification within a given tariff should a rate change or addition favor another appropriate classification.', 'Through software and hardware security, this exclusive control can be placed in the hands of the key manager within the shipper organization.', 'In order to determine whether or not an advantageous rate differential exists for a specific classification within a tariff, the shippers require two more attributes from an automated rate retrieval system:', 'The ability to electronically browse through public tariff data; and', 'Electronic notification of any changes or additions to a tariff.', 'Access via keyword or tariff item number to the public tariffs, as opposed to the subscribers’ private files containing product code tariff item linkage, must be provided to the user. Updates to the tariff file must be transmitted electronically on a daily basis to each subscriber according to the tariffs and commodities (not just commodity codes) they want watched.', 'Shippers require the system to provide them with enough information to decide between alternative carriers (or conference and independent carriers). This requirement will be met if the system provides the base rate and surcharge data for each tariff filed (and linked to the subscriber’s product code) between two geographic regions. If so, only the product code and the origin/destination ports are required to be input to the system to return the necessary rate information required for carrier selection.', 'Once the carrier is selected, the shippers require the system to calculate the freight charge, including port charges to the account of the cargo. The computer terminal operator or the inquiring computer should be able to input only the key shipment parameters (product code, weight and measure, value, packaging information, ports, date of shipment) for the system to calculate the total charges for the shipment. This pre-audit function provides accurate cost data for document preparation, invoicing, and freight payment.', 'No computer system can be expected to understand all of the complicated tariff nuances, especially when one considers some of the more complicated tariff terms and conditions. Therefore, any computerized rate retrieval system should be supported by a staff of competent and knowledgeable tariff analysts. Through the use of a telephone hotline, users must be able to contact an analyst who will have access to the printed pages of the electronically filed tariffs to discuss any aspect regarding the application of a specific classification or the calculation of any charge or surcharge.', 'The elements of an automated rate retrieval system are necessarily complex since sophisticated shippers require a system compatible with their own sophisticated internal systems. Simply replacing paper with terminals does little to assist potential shippers who are already competent users of today’s computer technology. It is important that vendors understand these requirements and that shippers make sure they are met by any system under evaluation.', 'The Shipping Act of 1916 requires that tariffs be filed at the FMC. Whether or not this provision will be withdrawn as part of the forthcoming Maritime Regulatory Reform Bill, the needs of the shippers to have access to accurate and timely rate data will not change. The data will still be required.', 'The data probably will continue to be filed at the FMC as before and available to anyone who wishes to collect copies of the 1,500 changes filed daily at the FMC. The shippers still require a system to provide them prompt knowledge of those changes, unskilled access to the rates, and a fully automated rating system.', 'If the data will no longer be filed at the FMC, the carriers will still be required to publish their rates, but the central clearinghouse function performed by the FMC will no longer be available. Then, not only will there be a need for an automated system to provide rate data, but there will be a need for a central clearinghouse as well. Manalytics believes that tariff users should take this opportunity that any alternative to the manual filing system at the FMC be electronic. There should be an electronic clearinghouse in place even at the FMC.', 'The first vendor to offer shippers a truly automated, shared-user, shipper-oriented rating service will be warmly met.', 'Click here for more articles from the archives of American Shipper.', 'FreightWaves Classics articles look at various aspects of the transportation industry’s history.\xa0Subscribe to our newsletter!', 'Have a topic you want us to cover?

Advocates for the open-source approach to AI say it promotes innovation and provides vital transparency, while those against argue that open-sourcing these powerful technologies leaves them open for misuse. Lately, critics have argued that many of the prominent so-called “open” AI technologies aren’t so open after all, and that the word has become more an object of marketing than a technical descriptor.', 'A new group called the AI Alliance, launched today by Meta and IBM along with around 50 founding members across industry, startup, academia, research, and government, wants to blow the whole debate wide open. The group—which includes AI leaders like Hugging Face and Stability AI—rejects the current dichotomy, believes it has minimized the definition and benefits of open, and is looking to expand the emphasis on open far beyond models.', '“The motivation of the alliance is actually to bring together a set of institutions and stakeholders who truly believe that open innovation, open discussions, open technology, open platforms, open ways of even defining safety, open ways of benchmarking, of exchanging data, is actually the right way to both advance the technology and make the benefits available broadly,” Sriram Raghavan, VP of AI Research at IBM, told Fortune.', 'When asked how the AI Alliance is defining “open,” Raghavan said that at this point he doesn’t want to say it has a point of view, but rather that the Alliance is meant to be a place where this can be explored. “We want to create a working group to form that point. Where we see opportunity here is to recognize that there are different levels of gradation of what ‘open’ means,” he said.', 'For one example, Raghavan described the potential to create a framework for releasing models with varying levels of openness.', '“Even to define what those levels are, what are the standards? How do you classify different levels of openness? What is it that we should mandate is absolutely open?” he said, proposing the types of nuances the AI Alliance aims to tackle. He also hopes these efforts will widen the AI conversation to focus on other uses of AI beyond LLMs, such as the use of AI for scientific discovery.', 'The advances in AI that led to this moment largely happened because of decades of an open, research-oriented approach. But now that AI has gone commercial, the tides have changed. Some of the biggest players in AI such as Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic have taken closed approaches so far (and are subsequently absent from the AI Alliance’s list of initial members). At the same time, large companies that have positioned themselves firmly in the open-source camp have come under fire for falsely claiming openness without disclosing key features of their AI systems, while at the same time using their offerings to further entrench their ownership over the landscape.', 'Meta, which is taking a leading role by co-launching the group along with IBM, has been at the center of this criticism. In a paper published this summer, for example, researchers called Meta’s claim that Llama-2 is open-source “contested, shallow, and borderline dishonest,” arguing that the model fails to meet key criteria that would enable it to be conventionally considered open-source. It’s interesting context when considering the AI Alliance’s mission to redefine and create varying levels of openness. Rather than embracing the previous ideals around open source, it looks like Meta is stepping forward to change the ideals.', 'This dynamic prompts questions about whether these efforts could be geared to further benefit incumbents. While the AI Alliance won’t be spared from the debates about open versus closed and who benefits from each, the group’s dynamic membership provides some sense of balance. Meta is a founding member, but so is CERN, the Linux Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and more than a dozen academic institutions from across the globe.', 'The AI Alliance will work on a project basis, meaning members will launch and autonomously run projects that others can join as they see fit. And while figuring out what “open” will actually mean to the group remains the first priority, Raghavan emphasizes that the AI Alliance wants to build, enable through skills and training, and advocate around its open approach to responsible AI.', ""“If you just look across the Alliance, we're talking about double-digit billion dollars of R&D capacity, millions of students who are trained and educated,” Raghavan said. “So there is a wealth here of opportunity to influence, and I think the institutions here are aligned around coming together so that we can then, you know, go in or drive the narrative in a way that makes sense to all of us.”"", 'And with that, here’s the rest of this week’s AI news.', 'Sage Lazzarosage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.comsagelazzaro.com', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Marathon Petroleum, it has a TSR of 283% for the last 3 years.

230,a4315d35-7f2d-3ecf-9e23-d531ebaee915,TGT,2023-12-06,Time to Rethink Target Stock (NYSE:TGT) after Strong Black Friday,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-rethink-target-stock-nyse-194245183.html,1701805365,STORY,['TGT'],"['While it’s not completely out of the woods, big-box retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) may deserve a rethink following reasonably encouraging results from Black Friday. Combined with the company’s better-than-expected earnings performance, Target’s core consumer base is demonstrating resilience against aggressive economic headwinds. It’s still a challenging prospect, but the overall de-risked profile of TGT stock makes me moderately bullish on it.', 'First and foremost, credit must be given where it’s due. Throughout most of this year, TGT stock appeared to be a money pit. Certainly, the underlying company’s own admission of critical headwinds – perhaps most notably the impact stemming from organized retail theft – cast a dark cloud over the business. At the time, I regrettably shared my bearish thesis. However, Target may finally be emerging out of the swamp.', 'In the middle of last month, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 in the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2023. This tally represented a 36% year-over-year lift and also handily beat Wall Street’s consensus EPS target of $1.47.', 'On the revenue front, the posted total of $25.4 billion slipped 4.2% against the year-ago quarter’s result. However, it managed to just beat analysts’ estimate of $25.3 billion. To be sure, it wasn’t all great news on the top line, as overall comparable sales fell by 4.9%. Also, digital sales incurred a 6% decline.', 'Nevertheless, Target Chair and CEO Brian Cornell put a positive spin on the disclosure, stating, “Our team continued to successfully navigate our business through a very challenging external environment. While third-quarter sales were consistent with our expectations, earnings per share came in far ahead of our forecast.”', 'After languishing for several sessions, TGT stock managed to jump by 18% in the trailing one-month period, and more gains aren’t out of the question based on a surprisingly resilient consumer base.', 'According to The Wall Street Journal, third-party analytics firms revealed that more shoppers visited brick-and-mortar retailers and transacted across various e-commerce platforms on Black Friday this year compared to 2022. That by itself should offer a decent lift in TGT stock, and it’s not just because of the increased sales volume.', 'Of course, all retailers seek to keep the cash registers ringing. However, Target, as a big-box retailer, stands to be a huge beneficiary of the post-pandemic societal pivot. As you probably know, several physical stores suffered brutal losses during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'During that time (Q2 2020), e-commerce transactions represented 16.5% of all retail sales. After a conspicuous erosion into Q2 2022, e-commerce is again experiencing positive momentum. Therefore, the willingness for shoppers to pivot back to brick-and-mortar retail is an encouraging development for TGT stock.', 'Interestingly, the WSJ stated that consumers relied more heavily on buy now, pay later (BNPL) platforms to conduct their transactions. That’s a point that TipRanks contributor Steve Anderson confirmed, noting that Block (NYSE:SQ) was one of the big winners in this particular financial technology (fintech) space.', 'On the one hand, the emphasis on BNPL symbolizes a challenge to Target. After all, the big-box retailer offers its own private-label credit card, which customers are eschewing for alternative payment services. However, on the positive end, the transition to BNPL also means that consumers haven’t entirely given up on discretionary purchases.', 'At the moment, TGT stock trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 17.2x. Considering that the specialty retail sector runs an average earnings multiple of 18.9x, Target is technically undervalued, but not by much. However, that’s arguably not the main focus for investors.', 'Rather, Target’s gross profit margin of 28.54% in Q3 deserves closer examination. Not only is it a significant improvement over the 25.79% gross margin printed in the year-ago quarter, but this metric is closing in on Target’s long-term average of about 29% to 30%.', 'Essentially, the company is witnessing a return of pricing power. That’s huge for TGT stock, considering the broader impact of stubbornly-high inflation.', 'Turning to Wall Street, TGT stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buys, 13 Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average TGT stock price target is $151.04, implying 13.4% upside potential.', 'Although not all of Target’s challenges have disappeared, the company gave itself a jolt of credibility with a better-than-expected earnings print. In addition, the retailer benefits from a consumer base that’s willing to make their dollars stretch despite various economic headwinds. As a result, the upside narrative for TGT stock is reasonably believable.', 'Disclosure']"

With the latest surge, the benchmark quickly erased its steep drop seen in the summer and has gained nearly 20% so far this year. The rally was driven by optimism that the Fed is done with interest rate hikes, which has pushed the Treasury yields down and rekindled investors’ risk-on trade. Yields on U.S. Treasuries saw the biggest monthly drop since 2008.The gains were broad-based across various segments and many stocks in the S&P 500 have gained more than 75% this year. We have highlighted five stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a Momentum Score of B or better and saw positive earnings estimate revisions for the current fiscal year over the past 30 days, suggesting continued outperformance. These are Nvidia NVDA, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, Arista Networks Inc. ANET, ServiceNow Inc. NOW, and Amazon.com AMZN. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.There is a growing confidence among investors that the Fed might be nearing the end of its rate hike cycle. This optimism was further fueled by comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that the central bank could cut rates starting in March. According to CME’s FedWatch tool, traders are pricing in a 70% chance for a rate cut by the U.S. central bank by next March. The latest round of data points has also strengthened the idea that the Fed is done with rate hikes.A significant portion of the S&P 500\'s gains can be attributed to the strong performance of a group of large-cap stocks, referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven."" This group, comprising Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla, has seen significant stock gains from 47% to 220% so far this year. The perceived safety of these investments, their sizes, competitive advantages and the potential of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence have been the key factors driving their performances.Further, better-than-expected earnings added to the strength. Earnings growth for the S&P 500 index, which was negative for each of the preceding three quarters, turned positive in the third quarter of 2023.', 'Nvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU.

The Bovespa index rose 0.3% in choppy trading and the real gained 0.4% against the dollar. Data showed Brazil\'s economy avoided contraction in the third quarter, growing by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in the three months through September instead of shrinking 0.2% as economists had expected.

More broadly, MSCI\'s basket of South American currencies was about flat against a stronger dollar.

The telecom and media giant is the latest to embrace streaming partnerships as wireless carriers and streaming platforms offer new discounted services.', 'Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the details, examining the potential revenue implications of these discounted deals.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '[AUDIO LOGO]', ""- Verizon announcing a new streaming bundle packaging Netflix and Max for as low a $10 month. Now bundling is becoming more popular within the media landscape as streamers embrace partnerships rather than competition. For more on this, we turn to Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Allie, this is feeling-- well, I think that we've heard this story before."", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, everything old is new again. The bundle is back.', ""- But there's new details, you break them down."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, so it's a little different than what we've seen in the past, though, because now we're seeing the distribution side get involved. We're seeing competitors be bundled together. I mean, bundling is nothing new, but we're certainly seeing that ramp up, especially over the past year or so. There's the Apple One bundle, where you can get Apple Music along with some other Apple services in there. We know Paramount has partnered with Delta Airlines and Walmart+, and that's a bundled subscription as well."", ""So this is something that's coming about as streamers are really trying to create a sticky environment. They want consumers to stay on the platform. They don't want to lose subscribers. And then, if you go to a company like Verizon, for example, they also don't want to lose subscribers."", 'If you notice any of the cable companies, whenever they report a loss of internet subscribers, broadband subscribers, that wipes off millions of dollars off of their market cap. So this is a way to create this synergy. And you would think everyone wins, but there are some cons here when you think about the pricing of all of this. Obviously, pricing is one reason to do this, but it could also drag down average revenue per user, metric known as RPU.', ""So at the end of the day, despite all of these bundles becoming more and more popular, companies like a Netflix or a Disney, they need to figure out more strategic ways to limit their spending in order to make sure that critical RPU number doesn't go down. Because this is a discount. At $10 a month, that's 40% of savings on the part of the consumer. So it's a double-edged sword that, if you're a media company, you have to grapple with."", ""JULIE HYMAN: What's also fascinating to me about the bundles is they're not customizable anymore. In other words, like, the bets that are being made are not driven by content, they're being driven by strategy.

For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.', ' See our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', ""We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$8.09b', 'US$8.52b', 'US$10.2b', 'US$10.6b', 'US$11.8b', 'US$12.7b', 'US$13.5b', 'US$14.2b', 'US$14.8b', 'US$15.3b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x14', 'Analyst x16', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 7.67%', 'Est @ 6.03%', 'Est @ 4.89%', 'Est @ 4.09%', 'Est @ 3.53%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% ', 'US$7.5k', 'US$7.3k', 'US$8.1k', 'US$7.7k', 'US$8.0k', 'US$7.9k', 'US$7.8k', 'US$7.5k', 'US$7.2k', 'US$6.9k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$76b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.2%) = US$259b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$259b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$117b', 'The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$193b.

Do keep this in mind.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.204. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation.

The company’s subscriber growth re-accelerated following the company’s crack down on password sharing, and the rollout of the advertising supported subscriber offering known as the Ad Tier, but the average revenue per user came in below expectations and is expected to remain muted in the near term. NFLX reiterated expectations for full year 2023 operating margins of 18-20%, and guided free cash flow to at least $5 billion, up from prior guidance of $3.5 billion.

Discovery (WBD), Disney+ (DIS), and Paramount (PARA).', '""The free ad-supported streaming television revolution... has really ramped up the opportunity for advertising on these services. You\'ll see each subscription service also have an ad-supported with lower priced tier over time,"" DeBevoise says, adding: ""The winner there is streaming overall.""', 'Click here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.', ""- And Marc, when it comes to the fact that so many of these companies overspent, to put in your words, when it comes to content, we've seen those losses really be a theme here over the last several quarters. We also started to see more bundling. And we're seeing more and more companies, it seems by the month, that are trying everything they can to lower those churn rates. Do you think that's going to work? And I guess what does that signal just in terms of is this the first step to broader consolidation?"", ""MARC DEBEVOISE: Yeah. So look, I think they are certainly looking at bundling as a way to reduce churn or a way to impact, you know, how they can retain those customers longer-- longer term. But at the end of the day, you're going to see those ARPPUs come down as you do those bundles, right? That ARPPU being Average Revenue Per User. So I think at the end of the day, they're going to give consumers a lot of different choices over the next few years. You're seeing Max and Netflix come together on Verizon's +play. You see the rumor about my old job Paramount Plus and-- and-- and Apple coming together."", ""I think ultimately the long term those-- those channel storefronts that you see on Amazon and Apple and others and I think many other technology platforms will start to bring together a lot of consumer options. Right? You'll have multiple choices of where to go. And you'll have multiple choices of what bundle to create on your own. And I think that's going to be a really great opportunity for consumers. Hopefully, it reduces that churn. But at the end of the day, these services are going to need to find a way to be more efficient with the spend that they're doing."", '- Yeah. Marc, how much pricing power do you think a lot of these streamers still have? The fact that they need to rely maybe a little bit more heavily on some of these bundles, trying to lower the costs, are we almost near that maxing out point when it comes to pricing, at least for now?', ""MARC DEBEVOISE: I think it's going to depend on the content and what you put in each service. Right? You've seen Netflix have meaningful power to go to almost $20 on an average subscriber. And you're seeing others go the other way with lower priced ad supported services. So I think you're going to see a spectrum. It's not a one size fits all."", ""Ultimately though, the idea that they all do need to save money on creating these services, and that's both in content and in technology-- and you know, I took the job as the CEO of Brightcove 18 months ago, with the idea that we could help these companies save some money on their infrastructure. They didn't all need to create the service bespoke on-- you know, on their own platforms. And it's not just the big six. There are hundreds of these companies around the world in each territory and in each area."", ""BRAD SMITH: It's also been the year of the advertising tier too over these past 12 months too. Is it clear whether there's a-- a clear winner in that-- in this early onset that's being able to woo marketers and advertisers and get some of those dollars to kind of offset where some of the users perhaps are saying, you know what, we don't-- we don't even want to see the ad, so we'll either pay up, or we'll pay into that advertising tier and pay less?"", ""MARC DEBEVOISE: Look, I love that that's happened. I think the fast revolution, the free ad supported streaming television revolution with Roku channel and the likes of Samsung TV and others has really ramped up the opportunity for advertising on these services. So you'll see each subscription service also have an ad supported with lower priced tier over time. I think each one will do it. I think the idea there is by the way the winner is streaming overall. Right? You see it ticking up in terms of market share overall in terms of consumption."", ""And I think we almost incorrectly look at it as like, well, broadcast is, you know, flat, and cable is down, and streaming is up. But just this is the new form of distribution and what is going to be the future globally. And so you're going to see every type of business model laid into that distribution format. And so having a strong ad supported service and a capability to be able to deliver that to users is going to be key. And you're seeing it in the ad dollar shift. Right? You're seeing ad dollars shift to that CTV platform now in a meaningful way over the past few years.""]"

The high specificity of the mechanism makes it uniquely suitable for the treatment of genetically-based diseases.', 'Following this path, Arrowhead has developed a proprietary drug development platform, dubbed TRiM, or Targeted RNAi Molecule, to use ligand-mediated delivery for tissue-specific targeting from a structurally simple therapeutic agent. The company has built up an extensive pipeline of drug candidates, targeting conditions as varied as NASH and other liver diseases, gout, hepatitis, myotonic dystrophy – it’s a long list, as the company has 15 active research tracks ongoing.', 'The most advanced pipeline project is plozasiran, a potential treatment for the cardiac condition hypertriglyceridemia.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Oracle ', 'As you can see below, Oracle had US$88.9b of debt, at August 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$12.1b, its net debt is less, at about US$76.9b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Oracle had liabilities of US$25.4b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$108.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$12.1b in cash and US$6.52b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$115.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', ""This deficit isn't so bad because Oracle is worth a massive US$320.9b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Oracle's debt is 3.9 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 4.5 times over. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. Unfortunately, Oracle saw its EBIT slide 5.5% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Oracle can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", 'Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Oracle recorded free cash flow worth 61% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""While Oracle's EBIT growth rate makes us cautious about it, its track record of managing its debt, based on its EBITDA, is no better. At least its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow gives us reason to be optimistic. Looking at all the angles mentioned above, it does seem to us that Oracle is a somewhat risky investment as a result of its debt. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since leverage can boost returns on equity, but it is something to be aware of. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - Oracle has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', 'Micron Technology already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Micron Technology, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.', ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Micron Technology. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.8% of common stock, and Capital Research and Management Company holds about 6.8% of the company stock."", 'Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 23 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.', 'While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.', 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.', 'I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', 'Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Micron Technology, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$232m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. ', ""The general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run."", 'I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Yum! Brands, it has a TSR of 52% for the last 5 years.

This year's awards are the most thorough to-date, naming winners across four key areas – Ocean, River, Luxury and Expedition."", '""The value of a cruise doesn\'t stop with mainstream sailings. From the fare inclusions on river and luxury sailings, to those on expedition sailings to further-flung destinations like Antarctica and the Galapagos, you\'d be hard-pressed to find a land-based vacation that delivers the experience and value that a cruise offers,"" McDaniel says. ""But beyond the overall value, the growing interest in cruises is also driven by the incredible range of destinations you\'re able to visit by water – from the poles of the earth, to inside riverways, and every trending destination in between.

It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Occidental Petroleum, it has a TSR of 205% for the last 3 years.

Our products treat and prevent a broad range of conditions that can diminish a person's quality of life, including stroke. Affecting more than 12 million people annually, stroke happens when blood flow to the brain is reduced or blocked, and can cause lasting, debilitating symptoms."", 'Meet three employees across the globe who have found their purpose in innovating and advancing products that help people lower their risk of stroke, whether during a medical procedure or daily life.', 'A constant reminder of the ""why""', 'For senior research and development engineer Luis Lopez-de-Victoria, protecting patients is the reason he always puts his best foot forward at work. His focus area is the SENTINELTM Cerebral Protection System, a device that is used to protect patients against the risk of stroke during transcatheter aortic valve replacement heart (TAVR) procedures, an alternative to open-heart surgery.', '""One of the ways a stroke can happen is during a TAVR procedure,"" says Lopez-de-Victoria. ""Embolic debris, such as valve tissue, can break loose and travel to the brain, which can block blood flow."" SENTINEL is designed to ""catch"" this debris before it travels to the brain.', 'After starting his career in the aerospace industry, Lopez-de-Victoria made the transition to Boston Scientific - and the health care field - almost three years ago and hasn\'t looked back. ""What inspires me most about the company are the people, and the mindset that we all share one common goal: putting the patient first,"" he says.', 'Lopez-de-Victoria and his team in Maple Grove, Minnesota, specialize in sustainment engineering, which involves gathering feedback from customers and physicians so the team can continuously adapt SENTINEL to meet evolving unmet needs and help more patients.', 'Besides his interest in technology, Lopez-de-Victoria has a deeply personal motivator in his role. ""My mom had a stroke a few years ago,"" he says. ""Thankfully, it was a minor one and she has since recovered, but it\'s a constant reminder of the ‘why\' behind our work. If I can help prevent one person - one family - from experiencing the effects of stroke, then that\'s everything.""', 'Seeing the whole picture for stroke prevention', 'As a production director, Colm Sheils is focused on continuously improving processes and adapting them as the company develops new products.', ""Sheils and his team in Galway, Ireland, touch several technologies that help lower stroke risk, including the WATCHMANTM Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) device. It's designed to lower stroke risk in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AFib), a condition in which the heart doesn't pump blood normally, causing clots to form. When clots escape, they can cut off oxygen to the brain, causing a stroke."", '""I think almost everyone knows someone who\'s had a stroke, and so this job hits close to home,"" says Sheils, who emphasizes the importance of employees seeing the whole picture when it comes to the technology they support. ""For example, our product builders regularly engage in line tours not just of the area they are working in, but of the complete line to see how the whole product comes together - and most importantly, its impact for the patient,"" he says.', 'A life-changing experience', ""While Lopez-de-Victoria and Sheils support the R&D and production of products that cut down on stroke risk, Tami Egawa's focus is on educating physicians and patients about the latest, cutting-edge technologies available to them."", ""As a director of sales and education based in Japan, Egawa interacts with health care providers regularly to raise awareness of products like the WATCHMAN LAAC device, which was approved in Japan in 2019. In addition to lowering stroke risk, the WATCHMAN eliminates the need for anticoagulants which can have side effects - such as stomach bleeding - that can negatively affect a person's quality of life."", '""The ability to stop taking blood thinners and no longer worry about stroke matters a great deal to many patients in Japan,"" says Egawa, noting that people of Asian descent suffer a higher risk of bleeding with anticoagulants compared with non-Asians. ""I\'ve spoken with people who were afraid to cook for their families for fear of cutting themselves, or who stopped wearing sleeveless shirts because of bruising on their arms from the blood thinners.

Among consumer brands, the generative AI charge has been led by one of the industry’s most storied names, Coca-Cola. In just nine months, the beverage giant has applied the technology in a variety of ways, creating one of the year’s best campaigns and showing a way forward for other brands in 2024 and beyond.', 'While many brands were on the sidelines watching the AI arms race at the start of 2023, Coke was quick to take advantage of a partnership between management consultancy Bain & Company and OpenAI to launch its “Create Real Magic” platform. Since then, the marketer has used the technology for a number of digital and experiential channels, with a recent campaign that took advantage of the buzz around the Las Vegas Sphere.', 'Marketing Dive spoke with Selman Careaga, president of the global Coca‑Cola category, about the soft drink giant’s partnership ecosystem, the launch of the AI-assisted Y3000 flavor as part of Coke’s ongoing Creations platform dedicated to limited-run products and how the company uses generative AI for both consumer-facing and internal tasks.', 'The interview has been edited for length and clarity.', 'SELMAN CAREAGA: First of all, it’s a partnership. For us, it’s not partnering with one or the other: We have a team of agencies and partners that we tap into. It’s a blurred world now. Bain is a consulting firm, OpenAI is a leader in the technology space. Then you have the WPP agencies, who are also in a fast-forward world trying to create digital experiences.', 'It’s an ecosystem of people that we partner with and that is the way to move forward, creating things that are a platform versus in the past where you would just get one agency, develop the platform, it would take months and then you learn from that and pitch some other ideas. Today, the world is more flexible in that regard.', 'We started with “Create Real Magic” using Bain and OpenAI, and we learned from that. We were very excited with our results. More than 120,000 pieces of content were posted and people were interacting with the platform for more than seven minutes. We took those learnings and we selected the 20 top creators out of that platform and in the summer we met with them [at the Real Magic Academy] to discuss how we could improve that as we move forward.', 'CAREAGA: What you are seeing now for Christmas is a result of what we learned on the platform, mostly around how people can interact in an easier way that’s more exciting. We believe we’ve made a platform now that is much more people-friendly to create a Christmas card that they can share with loved ones using Bain and OpenAI.', 'When we think of our ecosystem of agencies that we work with, of course, we partner with WPP mostly. The gist of that Christmas idea — the world needs more Santas — came from partnering with WPP, especially VMLY&R, as part of their agency network. Within that, we had a piece of video content and we are coming up with two short films that will be streamed. We’re tapping into the streaming world now as well; we learned from last year that it’s a way for us to connect in a different way with people.', ""CAREAGA: You start with the experts first. You learn how they use that technology, how they interact with the assets that Coca-Cola has and then how to take it to a more mainstream, scalable experience, which is now what we’ve done with Christmas. I don’t think it's just about using AI and AI replacing everything that we do, because we feel that AI is a tool to get faster, better insights. The [human intelligence] component is critical. For us, HI is as important as AI."", 'CAREAGA: In the past, you would create some piece of content or a quiz or a great Christmas ad and hope people like it. Today, with the Christmas card as an example, it’s a two-way street in terms of how we engage with people and allow people to play with such an iconic brand as Coca-Cola. That’s a big shift from how we would do things, especially the Christmas season, in the past. Now we have a platform that allows people to interact with the brand in different, highly scalable ways.', 'Everything that we do, we always respect the values that Coca-Cola has stood by for the 137 years of its existence, whether it’s authenticity, optimism, uplifting and inviting people to have small moments of happiness. We always start with that angle and whether it’s a tool, a technology or an experience, it has to live up to those brand values that we’ve always had. As we move forward, we’ll continue to respect the values but try to experiment and learn from these technologies as well.', 'CAREAGA: Y3000 is our eighth iteration of Coca-Cola Creations. With Creations, it’s not about a new product or a limited-time offer on the shelf, it’s really about creating experiences that tap into the digital world and the live world.', 'For us to come up with a new formula takes quite a bit of time. I can guarantee that we were discussing how to work with AI even before it became such a hot topic. The intent was to use AI and HI to understand how people think of the future: the emotions, the color, the flavors, the taste. We used those insights and then we worked with our R&D team and they came up with a formula for Y3000.', 'Once the product was launched, the Sphere represented a very unique opportunity to use probably the most innovative out-of-home space that you have today in the world and use it in a way that could not only create amazing visuals, but let people interact with our Y3000 platform via a QR code that’s creating a lot of engagement.', 'CAREAGA: We see it from both angles, including people-facing experiences or content that we can create — Y3000 and Create Real Magic are just a couple of examples, and hopefully next year, you’ll see some other exciting stuff coming up that we’re working on. But in the background, in our internal world of design and our processes, we’re tapping into it, whether it’s research or analytics that can create better insights in a faster, more relevant way. We can use AI as a tool together with our human insights team to come up with more relevant ideas we can work with.', 'With everybody starting to do an AI project, we now have a team that understands the partners we’re working with and how we can filter everything AI-related. That’s something that we did not have in the past. It allows us to create more synergies.', 'As long as we feel that we can create something that people can engage with and create a good experience for our brands, we will definitely continue to use the tool. If we can make something faster and use better insights as well, I think we’ll continue to use that tool.', 'This story was originally published on Marketing Dive.

(NASDAQ:INCY) is a pharmaceutical company specializing in developing and commercializing medicines to treat patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, graft-versus-host disease, solid tumors and various autoimmune diseases.', ""In recent months, Incyte's share price has been in a downward trend due to several factors. The first is growing concerns among financial market participants that the launch of new JAK inhibitors approved by regulators for the treatment of myelofibrosis could potentially slow the growth rate of Jakafi (ruxolitinib), which is Incyte's blockbuster and whose exclusivity ends in 2028. The second factor is the negative impact of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act on the health care sector, including the fact the federal government received the power to negotiate prices for the most expensive medicines covered under Medicare."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with INCY.', ""However, we believe Wall Street grossly overestimates the impact of the above risks on Incyte's financial position."", ""On Oct. 31, Incyte released financial results for the third quarter of 2023, which were generally better than our expectations. The company's revenue amounted to $919 million, an increase of 11.6% compared to the third quarter of 2022. On the other hand, non-GAAP earnings of $1.08 per share were 3 cents above analysts' consensus estimates."", ""Moreover, the demand for many of Incyte's innovative medicines, such as Jakafi, Opzelura, Minjuvi and Olumiant, continues to grow year over year due to their competitive advantages and the company's effective marketing strategies."", 'After receiving the CRL at the end of March 2023, the company continues to work on the resolution of Food and Drug Administration requirements to get approval for an extended-release version of Jakafi, and it is also developing combinations with other drugs to improve efficacy for treating myelofibrosis and chronic GVHD.', ""Author's elaboration, based on quarterly securities reports."", 'Further, Incyte has an extensive portfolio of experimental drugs, almost no debt and total cash and short-term investments that exceed $3.5 billion, representing 29.5% of its current market capitalization. As a result, the company has the financial capacity to begin pursuing a more aggressive merger and acquisition policy with the ultimate goal of diversifying its portfolio of product candidates and also increasing its revenue growth rate over the long term.', ""Author's elaboration, based on GuruFocus and Seeking Alpha data."", ""In addition to the factors discussed above, and with the company's operating income margin significantly improving in recent quarters, we believe Incyte's current stock valuation represents an attractive risk-reward profile for long-term investors."", ""Incyte's revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $919 million, missing our expectations by $6 million but up 11.6% year over year. Meanwhile, its forward price-sales ratio is 3.20, which is 11.02% below the sector average and 49.36% below the average over the past five years, indicating that Wall Street continues to remain conservative regarding the commercial prospects of the company's approved drugs and its product candidates."", ""One of the crucial reasons for Incyte's year-over-year revenue growth is the increase in sales of its products that contain the active substance ruxolitinib. So Jakafi (ruxolitinib), an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, chronic GVHD and steroid-refractory acute GVHD. Total sales of the company's blockbuster were $636.3 million in the third quarter, up 2.7% year over year, driven by higher prices and continued strong demand for it even as competition in the graft-versus-host disease treatment market intensifies."", 'However, ruxolitinib is commercialized outside the United States under the name Jakavi as a result of a partnership agreement with Novartis in 2009. Jakavi product royalty revenues were $96.6 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, an increase of 6.9% quarter over quarter thanks in part to its regulatory approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in September 2023 for the treatment of patients with GVHD.', ""Author's elaboration, based on quarterly securities reports."", ""The second key contributor that plays a crucial role in improving Incyte's financial position is Opzelura (ruxolitinib), the mechanism of action of which is based on the inhibition of two enzymes, JAK1 and JAK2, which are involved in several key cytokine pathways."", 'By meeting primary and secondary endpoints in a phase 3 clinical trial, the drug received its first FDA approval in September 2021 for treating patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. According to Incyte, approximately 10 million adolescents and adults suffer from this inflammatory skin condition, which represents a large market for Opzelura.', ""Moreover, with Opzelura becoming the first FDA-approved drug to treat repigmentation in patients with vitiligo in 2022, its sales growth continues to exceed our expectations. So sales of Incyte's product amounted to $91.8 million in the third quarter, an increase of 140.9% compared to the previous year."", ""Author's elaboration, based on quarterly securities reports."", 'In addition, given the last patent on Opzelura for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and vitiligo expires in 2040, this reduces the financial risks associated with the launch of generic versions of Jakafi in 2028.', ""Author's elaboration, based on 10-K filing."", ""The American pharmaceutical company is expected to publish its report for the fourth quarter of 2023 on Feb.7, 2024. According to Seeking Alpha, Incyte's revenue for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.97 billion to $1.06 billion, up 3.8% from analysts' expectations for the previous quarter."", ""Author's elaboration, based on GuruFocus and Seeking Alpha data."", ""Meanwhile, according to our model, the company's total revenue will be below the median of this range and will reach $985 million. Incyte's quarterly and year-over-year revenue growth will be driven primarily by increased demand for Jakafi, Minjuvi, Opzelura and Olumiant."", 'Created by author', ""Based on the results of 2023, we expect the company's operating income margin to reach 17.5%. On the other hand, this financial metric will increase to 18.6% by 2024, mainly due to increased demand for the company's key medicines, lower costs of raw materials needed for their production and the expansion of its portfolio of product candidates."", 'Source: Incyte Corp.', ""According to Seeking Alpha, Incyte's fourth-quarter earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 83 cents to $1.34.

ITT is gaining from strong momentum in the end markets like industrial, aerospace and defense. Higher sales volume and robust order growth are also driving the company’s performance.Let’s delve into the factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company a smart investment choice at the moment.Segmental Strength: Strength in the aftermarket business, driven by robust energy and mining markets, is aiding the Industrial Process (IP) segment. Increasing demand in the chemical and energy markets also bodes well for the segment. Growth in component sales within the aerospace and defense markets is driving the Connect and Control Technologies segment. Solid momentum in the friction original equipment business is driving growth for the Motion Technologies segment.Acquisition Benefits: ITT has been strengthening its business through acquisitions. The company inked a deal in November 2023 to acquire the privately held Svanehøj Group A/S (Svanehøj) for approximately $395 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024, subject to the completion of customary regulatory approvals. When acquired, Svanehøj will become part of ITT’s IP segment, focusing on highly engineered pumps, valves and aftermarket services.The acquisition of Micro-Mode Products, Inc. in May 2023 enhanced ITT's product portfolio and customer base, specifically for long-term defense programs. The addition of Micro-Mode grew ITT's existing North American connectors platform, which is part of its CCT segment.Innovation Initiatives: ITT has been investing in product innovation across its friction technologies, connectors and pump businesses for a while. For instance, in June 2023, the company made an initial investment of €50 million ($54.49 million) to expand a Friction manufacturing facility in Termoli, Italy, and to enhance the research and development competence in Barge, Italy. With this investment, ITT is likely to boost its position in the brake pad market for luxury and sporting vehicles.Business Strength: ITT is likely to benefit from its focus on fulfilling customers’ needs, operational execution, and innovation and growth investments. In the third quarter, the company’s organic orders grew 2% year over year, driven by strong demand in IP’s aftermarket business. For 2023, the company’s organic sales are expected to grow approximately 7-8% year over year. In the long run, a robust backlog in its businesses, supported by the recovery in the energy end market, is expected to boost ITT’s performance.Rewards to Shareholders: ITT is committed to handsomely rewarding its shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments. In the first nine months of 2023, dividend payments totaled $71.9 million and share repurchases were $60 million. The quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 10% in February 2023.Northbound Estimate Revisions: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ITT’s 2023 earnings has been revised 2% upward.Price Performance:\xa0 Shares of ITT gained 38.5% in a year against the industry‘s 6.7% decline."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Some other top-ranked companies have been discussed below.Federal Signal Corporation FSS presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This premier financial services tenant, making a long-term commitment, solidifies the building's reputation as a best-in-class, 1.25 million-square-foot Midtown Manhattan office space that is owned in a joint venture between SL Green and Vornado.Glen Weiss, the executive vice president and office leasing - co-head of Real Estate at Vornado, and Steven Durels, SL Green’s executive vice president and director of Leasing and Real Property, highlighted the significance of this lease. Together with a previously announced 100,000-square-foot renewal and expansion lease with a sovereign wealth fund, it underscores the robustness of the Park Avenue submarket.280 Park Avenue has undergone a $150 million full property redevelopment and modernization. The joint venture's commitment is evident in the creation of an expansive world-class lobby with 25-foot-high ceilings, a modernized amenities package, a focus on environmental sustainability and a complete redesign of the building’s plaza.Further, strengthening its position as Manhattan’s largest office landlord, SL Green announced a new lease with Stonepeak Partners, L.P., a leading international alternative investment firm. Covering the entire 31st and 32nd floors at 245 Park Avenue, this 76,716 square foot, 15-year lease contributes to SL Green’s total leasing activity of 199,872 square feet in the building for 2023.Steven Durels expressed excitement about welcoming Stonepeak Partners to 245 Park Avenue as the building embarks on a transformative redevelopment journey. The 1.8 million-square-foot Class A office space, located opposite JP Morgan Chase’s new world headquarters, will undergo an extensive redesign led by Kohn Pederson Fox.The redevelopment plan includes a jewel-like terra cotta overclad of the Park Avenue façade, new windows, lobby and elevator cabs, a spectacular plaza with columnar trees, a cutting-edge wellness center and innovative dining options. This move aligns with the growing preference of world-class companies for midtown as their preferred office location.Although the overall demand for office real estate still seems to be under pressure due to macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment, select markets are bucking the negative trend. Particularly, there is a growing preference from tenants for premier office spaces with class-apart amenities, and this is playing a key role in aiding absorption rates.Office occupiers are keen on growing their office footprint in New York City. Rents in the newly constructed or best-in-class redeveloped assets, which offer abundant amenities at transit-centric locations, have risen.With these recent leasing activities, SL Green continues to demonstrate its prowess in securing high-profile tenants and revitalizing prime office spaces. Investors looking for opportunities in the dynamic Manhattan real estate market may find SLG an appealing prospect, given its strategic vision and success in attracting and retaining top-tier tenants.

SLG recently announced that it has entered into a contract, along with its partners, to sell the fee ownership interest in 625 Madison Avenue to a global real estate investor for $632.5 million or $1,123 per square foot.This marks a strategic move on the part of SL Green as such disposition efforts generate incremental liquidity, which can be deployed for the repayment of its corporate debt.SLG and its partners will originate a preferred equity investment in the property worth $234.5 million. The company had acquired its interest in the property through a prior mezzanine investment.The 17-story, 563,000 square feet office building comes with ground floor retail space and is located between 58th and 59th Street. It is conveniently positioned in proximity to Central Park, with easy access to nine subway lines.Per Brett Herschenfeld, executive vice president, retail and opportunistic investments of SL Green, “Whether properties are upgraded to state-of-the-art office or are converted into a multitude of other uses that are in high demand, the appetite for Class-A office properties in prime Manhattan locations remains strong and growing.”Concurrently, SLG’s board of directors declared a monthly ordinary dividend of 25 cents per share on its common stock, marking a 7.7% reduction from its prior dividend payout of 27.08 cents. The new monthly ordinary dividend will be paid out on Jan 16, 2024, to stockholders on record as of Dec 29, 2023.The annualized dividend amount now totals $3.00 per share. The company’s annual dividend yield now comes to 7.10% based on the company’s share price of $42.22 on Dec 4, 2023. Check SL Green’s dividend history here.The dividend cut is likely a result of SL Green’s focus on maintaining its retained cash flow at desirable levels and its ability to provide a sustainable, recurring dividend to its shareholders amid the current challenging market situation.The United States office real estate market has been choppy for almost the entirety of 2023, with negative absorption and increasing vacancy levels.

Together with a previously announced 100,000-square-foot renewal and expansion lease with a sovereign wealth fund, it underscores the robustness of the Park Avenue submarket.280 Park Avenue has undergone a $150 million full property redevelopment and modernization. The joint venture's commitment is evident in the creation of an expansive world-class lobby with 25-foot-high ceilings, a modernized amenities package, a focus on environmental sustainability and a complete redesign of the building’s plaza.Further, strengthening its position as Manhattan’s largest office landlord, SL Green announced a new lease with Stonepeak Partners, L.P., a leading international alternative investment firm.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more."", ""Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing."", ' View our latest analysis for Aflac ', ""The President & COO, Frederick John Crawford, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.1m worth of shares at a price of US$81.37 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$82.61. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 30% of Frederick John Crawford's holding."", ""Insiders in Aflac didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!"", 'If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).', ""The last three months saw significant insider selling at Aflac. In total, insiders dumped US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain."", 'Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Aflac insiders own about US$396m worth of shares (which is 0.8% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.', ""Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Aflac (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about."", 'If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Firstly, the adoption of digitalization is revolutionizing water management, ensuring improved quality and quantity control with the support of technologies like 5G, blockchain, and cloud solutions. Secondly, wastewater processing is evolving through advanced oxidation processes, adsorption/biosorption, and biological remedies to reduce pollutants. Advanced filtration, driven by nanotechnology, is allowing the development of membranes that efficiently remove micropollutants, while biological filtration is gaining recognition as well. Moreover, flood prevention is advancing with improved designs, monitoring, forecasting, and catastrophe modeling. Water-saving technologies, including water reuse, recycling, and intelligent irrigation, are gaining momentum. Decentralized infrastructure is becoming popular for enhancing community resilience, with modular and mobile treatment systems providing alternatives to centralized systems. Furthermore, material science is contributing innovative materials to enhance water management efficiency. Lastly, desalination is evolving with a focus on cost reduction and environmental impact mitigation, utilizing renewable energy and biomimicry for salt extraction from seawater.', ""Deloitte observed that electric power companies are increasingly recognizing and disclosing water risk in their financial reports, highlighting potential challenges such as reduced generation and negative business impacts due to factors like inadequate precipitation, drought, and regulatory actions limiting water supplies. The rising water stress has led to increased water costs, particularly evident in nuclear power plants where average water and coolant expenses rose from US$138 to US$140 per megawatt between 2021 and 2022. Thermal power plants, relying on water for cooling, face efficiency issues and environmental regulations restricting water discharge. Western hydroelectric plants may be at risk of shutdown due to low water levels, but overall, the US power production has become less water-intensive over the years. The growth of wind and solar photovoltaic generation is expected to contribute to this trend as they don't rely on cooling water. However, the emerging trend of using electrolysis for green hydrogen production could potentially raise water consumption.

MISO asked FERC to allow its two proposals to be able to take effect by Jan. 22 so it can move forward with its stalled interconnection review process in March.', 'Like other grid operators, MISO has seen an explosion in interconnection requests across its territory, which runs from Louisiana to North Dakota. MISO’s 2022 interconnection queue cycle included 171 GW, exceeding its peak load by about 50 GW, according to the grid operator.', 'The “extraordinary sizes” of MISO’s ongoing queue cycles lead to unrealistic and untenable interconnection study results, driving project withdrawals that create delays and increased uncertainty for projects that remain in the queue, the grid operator told FERC.', 'After a six month stakeholder process, MISO last month proposed two sets of reforms to its interconnection process: the cap on the amount of capacity to be studied in a cycle and the new requirements aimed at weeding out speculative projects. The proposals are consistent with FERC’s new interconnection requirements, according to MISO.', 'The proposals are supported by the Organization of MISO States, which represents state utility commissions, and transmission owners in MISO’s footprint, including utilities such as Ameren, Duke Energy and Xcel Energy.', 'On the issue of the cap, the transmission owners said it\xa0offers MISO “a realistic way to handle the massive amount of interconnection volume being proposed, while simultaneously taming the currently unworkable study results.”', 'However, Alliant, DTE and AES Indiana told FERC in separate filings the proposed interconnection queue cap may make it harder for them to meet their clean energy goals and reliability obligations.', '“The proposed cap further threatens reliability in the MISO footprint by creating a potential barrier for entities responsible for resource adequacy requirements from entering needed projects into the interconnection queue,” Alliant said.', 'Under its cap proposal, MISO would release information about the cap 10 business days before an interconnection window opens. Interconnection requests would be processed in the order they are received. After the cap is met, interconnection requests would be put into the next queue cycle. MISO estimates that its proposed queue cap formula will result in a cap for the 2023 cycle totaling 76,560 MW.', 'MISO proposed several exemptions to its cap, including for requests from a state utility commission, cooperative utility board or other “relevant electric retail regulatory authority,” or RERRA.', 'If approved, MISO said it would consider revising its cap process after three interconnection study cycles.', 'MISO’s cap proposal would produce perverse incentives that will “create havoc, increase uncertainty, and discriminate against the very clean energy resources that the region needs,” the renewable energy trade groups said.', 'Under the plan, project developers would be forced to make “a mad dash” to submit projects to avoid being locked out of the interconnection process for several years, they said. At the same time, MISO’s proposed exemptions would enable some projects to avoid the cap, introducing a discriminatory two-tiered interconnection process.', '“MISO’s proposal notably achieves a hat trick of Federal Power Act … violations: The filing is unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory,” the trade groups said.', 'The Electric Power Supply Association strongly objected to the proposed RERRA exemption. “This exemption would give RERRA resources the unfettered ability to cut the line in MISO’s queue in the initial year and cannibalize and reduce the queue size in future years,” the trade group for independent power producers said.', 'If approved, the exemption could set an example for other market operators, undermining open and fair access for interconnections across the United States, EPSA said.', 'This story was originally published on Utility Dive.

Decrypting traffic for inspection is resource-intensive and fraught with operational, privacy and compliance issues. With the 7.4.1 Operating System now available across the entire Cisco Secure Firewall family, customers see AI go even further via the Encrypted Visibility Engine. The Encrypted Visibility Engine leverages billions of samples, including sandboxed malware samples, to determine if the encrypted traffic is transporting malware. It can tell which operating system the traffic is coming from and what client application is generating that - all without the need for decryption.', '""The ability for AI to reshape our daily lives and professional landscapes is immense. As a longstanding Cisco partner, we\'re excited about the new Cisco AI Assistant for Security and how this will empower our customers with AI-driven efficiencies,"" said Graham Robinson, Chief Technology Officer, Data#3.
