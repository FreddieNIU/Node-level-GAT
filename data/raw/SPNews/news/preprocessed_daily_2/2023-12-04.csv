The dividend yield is 1.0% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry.', ' View our latest analysis for Range Resources ', ""While yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Before making this announcement, Range Resources was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business."", ""EPS is set to fall by 52.0% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 12%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future."", ""While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.16 total annually to $0.32. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 7.2% per annum over that time. We like to see dividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. We are encouraged to see that Range Resources has grown earnings per share at 42% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend."", ""Overall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Range Resources might even raise payments in the future. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

If you want to skip our introduction to Mr. Munger's journey in life and the finance industry, then you can take a look at Charlie Munger's Life History & Stock Portfolio: 2 Biggest Positions. "", ""Charlie Munger is one of the few financial professionals who also had a close association with the journalism industry. Out of the hundreds of hedge funds and investment companies covered by Insider Monkey, none of the well known investment bosses such as Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments, Ken Griffin of Citadel Investments, Cathie Woods of Ark Investment, or others are known for their newspapers. However, Mr. Munger's Daily Journal Corporation (NASDAQ:DJCO) is a full fledged media business with a century old history that Warren Buffett's close associate and friend bought in 1977."", ""As if owning a media company wasn't enough, Mr. Munger's relationship with Mr. Buffett also enabled him to view the investment world from the eyes of the world's biggest investment management company, Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire is the most valuable financial firm in the world, and it owns billions of dollars of assets in the form of lucrative businesses, stocks, and other stakes that generate billions of dollars in profit each quarter without having the need to establish its own operations base. For instance, consider the fact that during the third quarter of this year, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A raked in $63.4 billion in revenue, and during the previous quarter, its profit sat at $35.9 billion."", ""Now, compare this to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Elon Musk's trillion dollar electric vehicle company that is one of the hottest growth stocks in the world. Tesla's revenue and profit during its latest fiscal year was $81.4 billion and $12.5 billion, showing that the investment behemoth that Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger built over the course of decades can earn more in three months than a company whose cars travel in nearly every major market in the developed world."", ""In fact, Mr. Munger's relationship with Mr. Buffett is actually quite interlinked with Berkshire. The pair met in 1959, two years after an associate told Mr. Buffett that the reason he chose to entrust him with his money was because his trustworthiness reminded him of Mr. Munger's. By then, the now Oracle of Omaha was operating six investment partnerships and was yet to make some of his biggest and defining investment decisions. From there, the two would get to know each other for roughly the next two decades before Mr. Munger became the vice chairman of Berkshire, a position that he would continue to hold until his death today, on November 28th, 2023."", ""Naturally, operating in the big leagues with the greatest investors of our time provides one with a unique perspective. And when it came to Mr. Munger, he didn't hold back any punches. His publishing company provided him a platform un associated with Berkshire to share his unfiltered thoughts on current financial events and products, and two which came under his radar before resigning from the DJC's chairmanship were bitcoin and the well known Gamestop Corporation (NYSE:GME) short squeeze."", 'In fact, during a DJC annual meeting, Mr. Munger, who also ran his own financial corporation, Wesco Financial in the late 1900s, stated:', 'Well, certainly the great short squeeze in GameStop was wretched excess. Certainly, the bitcoin thing is wretched excess. I would argue that venture capital is throwing too much money, too fast, and there’s a considerable wretched excess in venture capital and other forms of private equity.', 'And so… We have a stock market which some people use like a gambling parlor. And the transactions of the people who love the gambling parlor aspect of the business and those who want to make long term investments, to take care of their old age and so forth…I mean, muddle that in one market and it goes out of control because the stock market becomes an ideal gambling parlor activity. I don’t think that ought to have been allowed, either. If I were the dictator of the world, I would have some kind of a tax on short term gains that made the stock market very much less liquid and drove out this marriage of gambling parlor and legitimate capital development of the country. It’s not a good marriage, and I think we need a divorce.', 'Quite a sharp critique of a market in an era when trades are carried out by algorithms and satellite internet is believed by many to have the potential to unlock sizeable catalysts in the finance industry by reducing the time that it takes for market signals to travel through submarine cables.', ""The similarities between Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett are the sharpest when we compare Berkshire Hathaway and Munger's financial firm, Wesco Financial Corporation. Wesco is a Berkshire subsidiary and Munger became its CEO and chairman six years after he became Berkshire's vice chairman.\xa0 At the time, Wesco was primarily a savings and loan association that helped every day folks meet their financial needs. However, the sector started to come under increased regulatory scrutiny in an era that is quite similar to what we've recently experienced. Back then, the Federal Reserve was aggressively raising interest rates as well, and these upended the fundamental business model of the 'thrifts' since they had to borrow expensive money only to have already lent it out at cheaper rates."", ""Mr.\xa0 Munger's time at Wesco would see him 'sense' the impending doom for the savings and loans industry, and he would use Wesco's thrift subsidiary to invest in Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), or Fannie-Mae, to ride out the storm that hit the savings sector during the nine years between 1986 and 1995. Called the savings and loan crisis, this saw more than 30% of all thrifts in the U.S. wiped out, and thanks to Mr. Munger's business savvy, Wesco rode out the storm to exit the sector in 1992."", ""Finally, while Mr. Munger's association with Berkshire is often more widely covered, his business acumen also saw him rely on investing as a solid way to 'hedge' against downturns in the publishing industry. DJC has its own investment portfolio, and compared to most others, it invests in only a handful of stocks. Immediately after his passing, Mr. Buffett reminded everyone that Berkshire would not be where it is today without his friend, as he shared:"", 'Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie’s inspiration, wisdom and participation.', 'Charlie Munger', 'Our Methodology ', ""For our list of Charlie Munger's stock portfolio, we listed the Daily Journal Corporation's stock picks during Q3 2023."", ""Daily Journal's Q3 2023 Investment: $4.6 million "", ""U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a classic Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger stock pick. A sizeable U.S. bank, it pays dividends and is nearly a century old. Like Buffett, Mr. Munger was also an adherent of the philosophy of buying the right stocks and then holding on to them for years. Insider Monkey's research shows that the Daily Journal owned U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)'s shares as far back as 2016, when it held 140,000 shares that were worth $5.6 million. Since then, while the bank's stock has fallen by quite a bit, it has still managed to pay sizeable dividends."", 'Currently, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) pays a 42 cent dividend which provides it with a 5.18% annual yield.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Most Expensive Shoe Brands In the World.', 'According to a\xa0report by Grandview Research, the global luxury footwear market was valued at $33.52 billion in 2022. The global luxury footwear market is expected to grow from $33.82 billion in 2023 to $57.78 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%. As per the report, the formal shoe market dominated the industry with a revenue share of 58.2% in 2022. The rise in popularity of formal shoes primarily comes from professionals in the corporate or fashion industries. Additionally, North America dominated the market with a revenue share of 29% in 2022. The number of wealthy people and high disposable incomes in North America explains the rising demand for luxury footwear products. Europe followed North America as the second biggest market for luxury footwear.

While tourist flows did face a subtle decline due to geopolitical factors in the third quarter, the situation may now be considered normal. The report suggests that the sale of accessories, beauty products, and clothing products will likely be weak in the fourth quarter, especially after the decline in the current exchange rate by 3% in Europe. Furthermore, the outlook for 2024 suggests that the constant exchange rate may rise by 1% to 4%, pointing towards an influx of tourism flows. Such sets the base for optimism surrounding luxury goods sales growth by 8% in 2024.', 'On November 14, Reuters\xa0reported that Goldman Sachs expects European equities to close at 480 points by the end of 2024, a 7.5% increase. European commodities and luxury stocks have gained momentum, at 5% this year. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs also suggests that the annual GDP in Europe may rise by 0.9% in 2024, compared to an expected 0.5%, indicative of strong economic activity in 2024. All these factors combined may reflect a certain degree of optimism for the luxury goods market in 2024.

With these ideas, you’re almost giving up any practical intentions of robustly beating the market. Instead, you’re hoping to stay in the game and live to fight another day. It’s not appealing, but the strategy can be very effective, depending on the circumstances.', 'That’s especially true if the circumstances we’re dealing with is a possible economic downturn. While I certainly don’t want to intentionally promote a doom-and-gloom narrative, it would be wrong to dismiss the idea entirely. For example, the U.K. is facing elevated recession risks, as is the broader European region. Also, Japan’s economy is contracting, raising concerns.', 'True, these are other countries. However, because the global economy has become so interconnected, it’s difficult for any one nation to be fully insulated. Besides, American households already suffer from stubbornly high inflation and simultaneously high borrowing costs.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Now, that doesn’t mean consumer defensive stocks represent a perfect panacea.

If more people are coming back to the office, they’ll likely require an upgrade in the business wardrobe department. Also, not to be rude but we can’t forget that a lot of folks gained unwanted weight during the crisis. So, it’s possible that the wardrobe upgrade represents a matter of necessity.', 'Whatever the reason, the market loves ROST right now, a possible scenario I warned about last month; warned, that is, for bears interested in shorting ROST. With analysts rating shares a strong buy, I think Ross may have some legs left.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational food company, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) makes for a traditional case for defensive consumer stocks to buy. As an added bonus, KHC represents one of the top Warren Buffett stocks to consider. Since the Oracle of Omaha knows a thing or two about navigating various economic cycles, his indirect endorsement of KHC helps instill confidence.', 'However, it’s a riskier enterprise among defensive consumer stocks due to the present volatility. Since the start of the year, KHC gave up more than 14% of equity value. Of course, that’s not comforting. Still, on the other end of the aisle, KHC stormed almost 9% higher in the trailing one-month period. Undergirding sentiment was the company’s third-quarter earnings report, which saw Kraft Heinz beat per-share profitability estimates.', 'Also, management raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance, lifting investors’ opinion on KHC. It’s worth pointing out that the company offers a robust forward dividend yield of 4.58%.

For example, the company owns Oreo and Chips Ahoy!, among other delectable goodies.', 'Fundamentally, MDLZ ranks among the top defensive consumer stocks because of the trade-down effect.

Also, it specializes in other sectors, such as baby, medical, and pet food products.', 'Though exceptionally relevant, Nestle shares have admittedly been all over the map. Undulating throughout this year, NSRGF presently sits about 2% below parity for the year. However, it’s attempting to make a comeback. In the trailing one-month period, it returned stakeholders nearly 4% of equity value.', 'To be fair, NSRGF isn’t exactly a discount, trading at 27.72x trailing-year earnings. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 18.95x. Nevertheless, it enjoys a long history of robust earnings going back to at least 2008. Also, its revenue picked up significantly last year. Analysts also rate shares a moderate buy with a $131.36 price target, implying over 15% growth.', 'Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com', 'Arguably a no-brainer among defensive consumer stocks, Kroger (NYSE:KR) represents a grocery stalwart. As such, it’s hardly a sexy enterprise. When you acquire shares of KR, you’re not necessarily doing so to get rich quick. Rather, you’re banking on a consistent revenue and earnings stream. No matter who you are, you’re going to require the essentials.', 'To be fair, though, KR hasn’t excited investors even with the permanently relevant narrative. Since the start of the year, the security slipped almost 1% below parity. Nevertheless, the red ink also makes for an intriguing discounted opportunity. Right now, shares trade hands at only 9.79x forward earnings. For context, the underlying retail defensive sector features a median forward earnings multiple of 14.47x.', 'It also trades at a discount relative to trailing-year revenue. As an added bonus, Kroger offers a forward yield of 2.63%, along with a payout ratio of 26.45%. Therefore, investors shouldn’t have to worry too much about yield sustainability.', 'Lastly, analysts peg KR a moderate buy with a $52.75 target, projecting over 19% upside.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'On paper, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) appears one of the most relevant ideas for defensive consumer stocks. While the food processing and commodities trading firm doesn’t directly interface with consumers, its offerings undergird myriad consumer brands. Indeed, we wouldn’t be able to talk about the subject of consumer defensive ideas without ADM and its ilk.', 'Unfortunately, relevance alone hasn’t exactly helped Archer Daniels Midland. Since the start of the year, ADM lost more than 17% of equity value. In the past 52 weeks, it slipped almost 24%. To be sure, its Q3 earnings report didn’t help the fundamental narrative. While the company’s profit beat on ethanol margins, certain key segments lagged expectations, per Reuters.', 'Still, for the contrarians, ADM could be appealing. Right now, shares trade at 11.07x forward earnings, below the sector median of 15.3x. In addition, the business is consistently profitable, leading to a forward yield of 2.42%. Also, the company has enjoyed 50 years of consecutive dividend increases.', 'Finally, analysts rate ADM a moderate buy with a $92.83 price target, implying 25% growth.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into SLB's dividend performance and assess its sustainability."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with SLB.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', ""SLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, is the largest oilfield service firm in the world, with expertise in myriad disciplines, including reservoir performance, well construction, production enhancement, and more recently, digital solutions. It maintains a reputation as one of the industry's leading innovators, which has earned it dominant share in numerous end markets."", 'SLB has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1985. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', ""As of today, SLB currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.77% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 1.91%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, SLB's annual dividend growth rate was -31.20%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to -26.10% per year. And over the past decade, SLB's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at -7.10%."", ""Based on SLB's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of SLB stock as of today is approximately 0.39%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-09-30, SLB's dividend payout ratio is 0.32."", ""SLB's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers.

SLB's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook. Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and SLB's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. SLB's revenue has increased by approximately -6.30% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 80.51% of global competitors."", ""The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, SLB's earnings increased by approximately 11.50% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 60.98% of global competitors."", ""Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 22.10%, which underperforms than approximately 29.67% of global competitors."", ""In light of SLB's dividend payments, dividend growth rate, payout ratio, profitability, and growth metrics, investors should consider the overall financial health and future prospects of the company when evaluating its dividend sustainability. While past performance indicates a steady commitment to dividends, the negative growth rates in dividends per share over the past decade call for cautious optimism. With a moderate profitability and growth rank, SLB appears to be maintaining a balance between returning value to shareholders and investing in future growth. However, the underperformance in revenue and earnings growth relative to peers may be a concern for long-term dividend reliability. Investors may want to monitor SLB's upcoming financial reports and industry trends to better understand the potential impact on future dividend payments."", 'GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Not quite precognition, but an ability to spot and put together clues and trends, to discern the ‘next big thing’ before it hits. This is true in every stock sector, but today we’ll focus on biotech.', 'The biotech firms have famously high product lead times, paired with equally high overhead expenses; it’s a combination that would make them unlikely investments, except that when a drug is approved, it can turn into a blockbuster. Successful biotech investors will learn how to spot those blockbuster biotech opportunities before they hit.', 'A new sector review by Oppenheimer’s five-star analyst Jay Olson sees just such an opportunity in the market for obesity drugs. He notes that this field has multi-billion-dollar market potential, and writes, “We consider obesity the next wave for healthcare investors following on the heels of Immuno-Oncology (IO). Consensus sales for obesity drugs already approved and in development are expected to reach ~$67B. Meanwhile, obesity sales are expected to exceed IO in 2029 before reaching a similar peak in 2032. The obesity opportunity is driven by overwhelming demographics and favorable treatment dynamics in subpopulations enabling positive treatment outcomes.”', 'Olson goes on to start picking the biopharma companies that are ready to take advantage of this ‘next wave.’ Here are two of Olson’s choices, two stocks that are set for gains in the year ahead, on the obesity drug bandwagon, with details taken from the TipRanks platform.', 'J.P. Morgan Recommends These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks With Over 60% Upside Potential', '‘Bright Spots’ Could Lift These 2 Hotel REIT Stocks Higher, Says Oppenheimer', 'There’s an\xa0Opportunity Brewing in These 3 Stocks, Says Goldman Sachs', 'Viking Therapeutics (VKTX)', 'We’ll start with Viking Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company in the clinical stages of development, focusing its research on the treatment of endocrine disorders and other metabolic diseases. The company’s pipeline features novel therapies that are either first-in-class or best-in-class and are designed as orally-dosed, small-molecule compounds.', 'Viking currently has three drug candidates in its research pipeline, spread across four separate study tracks. The company’s leading drug candidate, VK2809, shows promise as a potential treatment for several metabolically-linked conditions, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), type-2 diabetes, and obesity, all of which are interrelated. The company’s second-leading candidate, VK2735, directly targets metabolically-linked obesity.', 'Viking has garnered attention with VK2809, its NASH candidate, which is currently in the Phase 2b clinical trial stage, known as VOYAGE. Earlier this month, the company released data indicating a positive effect on liver fat reduction across various patient subgroups, including patients with F1 fibrosis and a related risk factor such as obesity.', 'Of more immediate interest to investors seeking a biopharma with an obesity-centered pipeline, Viking initiated the Phase 2 VENTURE trial for VK2735 in the treatment of obesity this year. VK2735 is a wholly-owned drug candidate, acting as an agonist of the GLP-1 and GIP receptors. Previous data from the Phase 1 trial demonstrated that the drug candidate was well-tolerated under various dosing regimens, with an acceptable safety profile. Viking has completed the patient enrollment process for the VENTURE study, and results are expected to be released in 1H24.', 'Oppenheimer’s Jay Olson sees these two drug candidates as key drivers for Viking, especially VK2809 and its applications for NASH. He does not neglect the obesity-centered candidate VK2735, however, and writes, “We view VKTX’s lead candidate THR-β agonist VK2809 for NASH as similar to Madrigal Pharmaceutical’s MGL-3196 with comparable Ph2a efficacy results of relative liver fat reduction that are at least as strong. We believe that if VK2809 Ph2b biopsy-confirmed NASH trial outcome is sufficient to continue into Ph3 development, then we see VKTX’s current market cap as undervalued compared to its peers. We believe that VK2735 offers asymmetric upside potential based on current valuation.”', 'Olson sees plenty of room to run on this stock – more than enough to justify his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. He gives these shares a $40 price target, implying a robust 207% upside potential on the one-year horizon. (To watch Olson’s track record, click here)', 'It’s clear that Wall Street agree with this bullish case. The stock has 6 recent ratings, and they are unanimously positive – for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are trading for $13.01, and their $34 average price target suggests a one-year upside of 161%. (See VKTX stock forecast)', 'Amgen, Inc. (AMGN)', 'For the second Oppenheimer pick, we’ll look at one of the largest biotechs in the US. Amgen, based out of Thousand Oaks, California, is ranked sixth largest among US biopharmas, by market cap – and ranked #18 globally by annual revenue. The firm is the largest employer in its home city, with approximately 5,000 employees working at its headquarters.', 'Amgen has both a solid stable of marketable drugs and an extensive research pipeline of new drug candidates. Unlike the small biopharmas, Amgen can boast having a sizable revenue stream, some $26 billion in 2022, based on its lines of approved products. That revenue stream is expanding this year; Amgen’s $19.87 billion in revenue through the third quarter of this year was up 2.8% from the first nine months of last year.', 'That gives the company a strong foundation to fund its extensive research program. For our purposes here, we’ll look at two drug candidates in the program – AMG 133 and AMG 786. Each targets obesity, but in different ways. AMG 133 is a multispecific molecule designed to inhibit the GIPR receptor while activating the GLP-1 receptor. The target patient population for the current Phase 2 study of the drug candidate targets overweight or obese adults with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Enrollment in the study is complete, and Amgen expects to release its topline data late next year.', 'Amgen’s second obesity drug candidate is AMG 786, a small molecule compound in a targeted obesity program. Amgen has been careful in designing these drugs, to avoid duplicating their modes of action. The initial data readout on AMG 133 is planned for 1H24.', 'Oppenheimer’s Jay Olson holds an optimistic view of Amgen, particularly highlighting AMG 786 as a significant factor. He states, “We view several pipeline assets as underappreciated ahead of near-term readouts, such as oral AMG-786 with a unique MOA for obesity with Ph1 data in 1H24… We forecast Amgen revenue growth over the next ten years leveraged by margin expansion, as management has a track record of financial discipline. On the top line, we believe Amgen is in a position to maintain long-term revenue growth as mature products fade while the R&D pipeline continues to more than compensate with innovative new products.”', 'Taking this forward, Olson gives AMGN shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, along with a $310 price target that suggests a 14% increase over the coming year.', 'Turning now to the rest of the Street, opinions vary. 12 Buys, 8 Holds and 2 Sells add up to a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating. Additionally, the $283.86 average price target implies a modest upside potential of 4%.

On average, the Northeast and West Coast have higher costs of living than the South and Midwest. Florida stands out as one of the more affordable states in the US, with a cost-of-living index just 2.3% above the national average. In the state-wise cost-of-living ranking by the World Population Review, Florida holds the 21st position. These rankings are derived from standard household spending across various categories, including rent/housing, utilities, groceries, transportation, healthcare, and miscellaneous goods and services. Florida scores below the national averages in five out of six subcategories. However, it registers 10.5% above the national average, specifically in housing expenses, as indicated by the US Cost of Living Index (COLI), which compares these six subcategories.

Similarly, the Sunshine State is popular as a retirement destination as well as an employment center due to the large businesses that call the state their home. Some of the famous companies operating in the state include Carrier Global Corp (NYSE:CARR), Jabil Inc (NYSE:JBL), and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE).', ""Here's what Matrix Asset Advisors said about NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '“During the quarter, we started a new position in\xa0NextEra Energy, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:NEE), the owner of Florida Power & Light (FPL), a regulated utility, and NextEra Energy Resources, the largest unregulated alternative power producer (wind, solar, battery) in the United States. FPL has benefitted from Florida’s population and business growth. In addition, Florida’s regulators have been business friendly and allowed the utility to raise rates, earn a good profit, and build out its infrastructure. As a result, NextEra has historically shown earnings and dividend growth above the Utility group average.

This growth rate surpassed the national average and was largely supported by federal relief funds released during the pandemic. However, as post-pandemic relief measures stopped, the growth rate declined to 4.9%. In the future, Florida's income is projected to sustain a high growth of 7.8% due to ongoing salary increases. Florida was among the states most impacted by reduced wage growth rates, primarily due to the lockdown's effects on low-wage service staff employed in the service and tourism industries. Florida maintained an unemployment rate below 4% from January 2018 to February 2020. However, with the start of the pandemic, the unemployment rate rose to 14.1% in May 2020. This was significantly higher than the previous peak of 10.9% recorded in the initial four months of 2010 during the Great Recession."", ""The Florida Legislature Office of Economic and Demographic Research indicates a positive trajectory for the state, projecting population growth rates of 1.27% until 2030. This is nearly double the US average of 0.64%. This, combined with Florida's demonstrated economic resilience, paints a promising picture for the state's future. Fitch Ratings has emphasized that Florida's sound financial management has played a crucial role in supporting strong state revenues. Florida is also rapidly becoming a destination of choice for people earning well because it is one of the states that do not levy a state income tax. It is among the top 5 Tax-Friendly States for High Income in the US. Taxes in these states take up about 6% of the average household income, while the US average tax burden in the worst-taxed states can be as high as 17% for the average household.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Rockwell Automation's current trading price of US$281 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap?

It’s trading around 18.89% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Rockwell Automation today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $236.75, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Rockwell Automation’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Rockwell Automation's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 33%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ROK’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Most Expensive Shoe Brands In the World.', 'According to a\xa0report by Grandview Research, the global luxury footwear market was valued at $33.52 billion in 2022. The global luxury footwear market is expected to grow from $33.82 billion in 2023 to $57.78 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%. As per the report, the formal shoe market dominated the industry with a revenue share of 58.2% in 2022. The rise in popularity of formal shoes primarily comes from professionals in the corporate or fashion industries. Additionally, North America dominated the market with a revenue share of 29% in 2022. The number of wealthy people and high disposable incomes in North America explains the rising demand for luxury footwear products. Europe followed North America as the second biggest market for luxury footwear. You can also check out some of the global luxury stocks.\xa0', 'On November 14, Reuters\xa0reported that global luxury goods sales will likely slow down during the fourth quarter as tourism and spending in Europe tightens. According to Bain and Company, the sale and demand of luxury goods are heavily derived and dependent on tourist flows. While tourist flows did face a subtle decline due to geopolitical factors in the third quarter, the situation may now be considered normal. The report suggests that the sale of accessories, beauty products, and clothing products will likely be weak in the fourth quarter, especially after the decline in the current exchange rate by 3% in Europe. Furthermore, the outlook for 2024 suggests that the constant exchange rate may rise by 1% to 4%, pointing towards an influx of tourism flows. Such sets the base for optimism surrounding luxury goods sales growth by 8% in 2024.', 'On November 14, Reuters\xa0reported that Goldman Sachs expects European equities to close at 480 points by the end of 2024, a 7.5% increase. European commodities and luxury stocks have gained momentum, at 5% this year. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs also suggests that the annual GDP in Europe may rise by 0.9% in 2024, compared to an expected 0.5%, indicative of strong economic activity in 2024. All these factors combined may reflect a certain degree of optimism for the luxury goods market in 2024.

That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.31 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, International Business Machines has a higher ROE than the average (13%) in the IT industry.', ""That's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", 'International Business Machines does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.37. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.', 'Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this.

With these ideas, you’re almost giving up any practical intentions of robustly beating the market. Instead, you’re hoping to stay in the game and live to fight another day. It’s not appealing, but the strategy can be very effective, depending on the circumstances.', 'That’s especially true if the circumstances we’re dealing with is a possible economic downturn. While I certainly don’t want to intentionally promote a doom-and-gloom narrative, it would be wrong to dismiss the idea entirely. For example, the U.K. is facing elevated recession risks, as is the broader European region. Also, Japan’s economy is contracting, raising concerns.', 'True, these are other countries. However, because the global economy has become so interconnected, it’s difficult for any one nation to be fully insulated. Besides, American households already suffer from stubbornly high inflation and simultaneously high borrowing costs.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Now, that doesn’t mean consumer defensive stocks represent a perfect panacea. But if you want to stay in the market during these (potential) troubles, the below ideas offer much confidence.', 'Source: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com', 'Now, before you blast me by pointing out that Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) generally falls under the discretionary sector, I also believe it more than tangentially crosses paths with the traditional defensive consumer stocks. Yes, Ross is where you go to find designer brands at discounted rates. Still, with society actively normalizing, the company will likely rise in relevance.', 'As a relatively recent CNBC article pointed out, the “golden age” of remote work may be coming to an end. If more people are coming back to the office, they’ll likely require an upgrade in the business wardrobe department. Also, not to be rude but we can’t forget that a lot of folks gained unwanted weight during the crisis. So, it’s possible that the wardrobe upgrade represents a matter of necessity.', 'Whatever the reason, the market loves ROST right now, a possible scenario I warned about last month; warned, that is, for bears interested in shorting ROST. With analysts rating shares a strong buy, I think Ross may have some legs left.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational food company, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) makes for a traditional case for defensive consumer stocks to buy. As an added bonus, KHC represents one of the top Warren Buffett stocks to consider. Since the Oracle of Omaha knows a thing or two about navigating various economic cycles, his indirect endorsement of KHC helps instill confidence.', 'However, it’s a riskier enterprise among defensive consumer stocks due to the present volatility. Since the start of the year, KHC gave up more than 14% of equity value. Of course, that’s not comforting. Still, on the other end of the aisle, KHC stormed almost 9% higher in the trailing one-month period. Undergirding sentiment was the company’s third-quarter earnings report, which saw Kraft Heinz beat per-share profitability estimates.', 'Also, management raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance, lifting investors’ opinion on KHC. It’s worth pointing out that the company offers a robust forward dividend yield of 4.58%. Analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $36.65 average price target.', 'Source: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com', 'An oldie but a goodie when it comes to defensive consumer stocks, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is about as inoffensive of an investment as you can get. When you think about it, some of the most alluring growth stories materialized because they were audacious; they ticked people off. Indeed, in the market and in life, you’ve got to be willing to be offensive to stand a chance of shining.', 'Whatever you think about this narrative, that’s not happening with P&G. As a manufacturer of various household goods, the company doesn’t want you to think too much about it. Rather, its main job is to present an attractive, trusted brand that you keep coming back to over and over. It’s hardly a recipe for spiciness but it gets the job done.', 'Financially, P&G’s not remarkable: just keep the nose clean with consistent profitability. In turn, the company offers a forward yield of 2.49%. As well, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $164.24 average price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A multinational confectionary company, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) provides a diverse look for its underlying business. In addition to the sweet stuff, the company specializes in food, beverage and snacks. However, it’s probably best known for the brands that send you to the dentist’s office. For example, the company owns Oreo and Chips Ahoy!, among other delectable goodies.', 'Fundamentally, MDLZ ranks among the top defensive consumer stocks because of the trade-down effect. As you know, sugar and caffeine represent two of the most commonly used substances in Western nations. Frankly, a lot of us need these two vices to help us through the nine-to-five grind. During bull markets, it’s easier to justify going to coffee shops and eateries to have your fill.', 'However, during economic downturns, those same people may turn to the grocery aisles. That’s where Mondelez does its business. Thanks to the company’s consistent profitability, it pays out a forward yield of 2.37%. Also, analysts dig it, pegging shares a strong buy with a $78.67 price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Although trading in the over-the-counter market, Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGF) deserves consideration for defensive consumer stocks to buy. As one of the food and beverage powerhouses, Nestle commands a strong global presence. Among its popular brands are Nespresso, Nescafé, Kit Kat, Smarties, Nesquik, and Stouffer’s, to name but a few. Also, it specializes in other sectors, such as baby, medical, and pet food products.', 'Though exceptionally relevant, Nestle shares have admittedly been all over the map. Undulating throughout this year, NSRGF presently sits about 2% below parity for the year. However, it’s attempting to make a comeback. In the trailing one-month period, it returned stakeholders nearly 4% of equity value.', 'To be fair, NSRGF isn’t exactly a discount, trading at 27.72x trailing-year earnings. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 18.95x. Nevertheless, it enjoys a long history of robust earnings going back to at least 2008. Also, its revenue picked up significantly last year. Analysts also rate shares a moderate buy with a $131.36 price target, implying over 15% growth.', 'Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com', 'Arguably a no-brainer among defensive consumer stocks, Kroger (NYSE:KR) represents a grocery stalwart. As such, it’s hardly a sexy enterprise. When you acquire shares of KR, you’re not necessarily doing so to get rich quick. Rather, you’re banking on a consistent revenue and earnings stream. No matter who you are, you’re going to require the essentials.', 'To be fair, though, KR hasn’t excited investors even with the permanently relevant narrative. Since the start of the year, the security slipped almost 1% below parity. Nevertheless, the red ink also makes for an intriguing discounted opportunity. Right now, shares trade hands at only 9.79x forward earnings. For context, the underlying retail defensive sector features a median forward earnings multiple of 14.47x.', 'It also trades at a discount relative to trailing-year revenue. As an added bonus, Kroger offers a forward yield of 2.63%, along with a payout ratio of 26.45%. Therefore, investors shouldn’t have to worry too much about yield sustainability.', 'Lastly, analysts peg KR a moderate buy with a $52.75 target, projecting over 19% upside.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'On paper, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) appears one of the most relevant ideas for defensive consumer stocks. While the food processing and commodities trading firm doesn’t directly interface with consumers, its offerings undergird myriad consumer brands. Indeed, we wouldn’t be able to talk about the subject of consumer defensive ideas without ADM and its ilk.', 'Unfortunately, relevance alone hasn’t exactly helped Archer Daniels Midland. Since the start of the year, ADM lost more than 17% of equity value. In the past 52 weeks, it slipped almost 24%. To be sure, its Q3 earnings report didn’t help the fundamental narrative. While the company’s profit beat on ethanol margins, certain key segments lagged expectations, per Reuters.', 'Still, for the contrarians, ADM could be appealing. Right now, shares trade at 11.07x forward earnings, below the sector median of 15.3x. In addition, the business is consistently profitable, leading to a forward yield of 2.42%. Also, the company has enjoyed 50 years of consecutive dividend increases.', 'Finally, analysts rate ADM a moderate buy with a $92.83 price target, implying 25% growth.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Inflation can act as a double-edged sword for digital payments companies, as higher prices of goods and services can increase the commission earned on transactions. On the flip side, high prices can result in a decline in consumer spending, leading to an overall reduction in payment volumes. However, so far, inflation has not slowed down the current pace of cross-border travel, positively impacting the results of companies in this space.', 'Improving travel numbers coupled with the continued adoption of electronic payments should continue to act as a boon for companies in the digital payments space.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Most Expensive Shoe Brands In the World.', 'According to a\xa0report by Grandview Research, the global luxury footwear market was valued at $33.52 billion in 2022. The global luxury footwear market is expected to grow from $33.82 billion in 2023 to $57.78 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%. As per the report, the formal shoe market dominated the industry with a revenue share of 58.2% in 2022. The rise in popularity of formal shoes primarily comes from professionals in the corporate or fashion industries. Additionally, North America dominated the market with a revenue share of 29% in 2022. The number of wealthy people and high disposable incomes in North America explains the rising demand for luxury footwear products. Europe followed North America as the second biggest market for luxury footwear. You can also check out some of the global luxury stocks.\xa0', 'On November 14, Reuters\xa0reported that global luxury goods sales will likely slow down during the fourth quarter as tourism and spending in Europe tightens. According to Bain and Company, the sale and demand of luxury goods are heavily derived and dependent on tourist flows. While tourist flows did face a subtle decline due to geopolitical factors in the third quarter, the situation may now be considered normal. The report suggests that the sale of accessories, beauty products, and clothing products will likely be weak in the fourth quarter, especially after the decline in the current exchange rate by 3% in Europe. Furthermore, the outlook for 2024 suggests that the constant exchange rate may rise by 1% to 4%, pointing towards an influx of tourism flows. Such sets the base for optimism surrounding luxury goods sales growth by 8% in 2024.', 'On November 14, Reuters\xa0reported that Goldman Sachs expects European equities to close at 480 points by the end of 2024, a 7.5% increase. European commodities and luxury stocks have gained momentum, at 5% this year. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs also suggests that the annual GDP in Europe may rise by 0.9% in 2024, compared to an expected 0.5%, indicative of strong economic activity in 2024. All these factors combined may reflect a certain degree of optimism for the luxury goods market in 2024.

(NYSE:MTD). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Mettler-Toledo International’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Mettler-Toledo International ', 'The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 14.83% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Mettler-Toledo International today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $961.87, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Mettler-Toledo International’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Mettler-Toledo International's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? MTD’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MTD, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

But, financial ratios are at our fingertips today. Virtually no information escapes real-time pricing updates (especially with systematic and algorithmic trading systems).', 'This makes undervalued stocks a tricky subject to navigate. Pinning down the best undervalued stocks to buy is more than finding those with a price-to-book value below one. And, it’s more than picking shares that trade below average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. While these can and should be part of your equation, relying on them alone isn’t sufficient.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Instead, you’ll need to evaluate the position of a stock today compared to the place it will be tomorrow. This differs from growth investing because you’re typically targeting mature companies with a proven product or service that trades low relative to where you see market forces blowing it in coming months or years.', 'I think that, considering the holiday season and surprisingly strong preliminary consumer shopping stats, these undervalued stocks aren’t properly priced by market participants relative to their short-term strength and long-term prospects.', 'Source: akamakis / Shutterstock.com', 'I’ve been a fan of SharkNinja (NYSE:SN) since it hit the stock exchange this summer. This weekend cemented its position at the top of my list of undervalued stocks to buy. While far from scientific, my own family’s Black Friday shopping experience was dominated by SharkNinja products at Target (NYSE:TGT) and other big-box retail outlets. What’s more, a quick glance around others’ carts saw tons of SharkNinja products, from vacuum cleaners to ice cream machines. Again – far from scientific, but the brand’s omnipresence could bode well for its holiday sales prospects.', 'The company’s longstanding sales strength reinforces that sentiment. Since 2008, the appliance company’s sales increased 20% annually. In the company’s most recent filing, management already noted a 15% year over year (YOY) sales bump, well before holiday shopping even started.', 'With shares trading as much as 40% below analyst expectations, SharkNinja tops my list of undervalued stocks to buy.', 'Source: 360b / Shutterstock.com', 'Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is seeing strong sales this year as more Americans trim outside entertainment for the stay-at-home variety. Net bookings, a stat unique to online gaming companies, measure digital and physical sales by adding net revenue to the change in deferred net revenue for online games. In the most recent quarter, EA posted a 6% YOY net bookings growth.', 'At the same time, the company posted a 33% YOY net income growth despite a much smaller uptick in revenue. This shows that the company can more efficiently cut costs by focusing on core operational principles while maximizing online gaming’s popularity.', 'Management keeps its expectations low, saying they expect to close the year with roughly flat to up 5% YOY. That may seem a grim outlook. But considering recent performance and upcoming holiday sales, interpreting the statement with cautious optimism is warranted.', 'PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has a massive moat and remains nearly untouchable. That places it among undervalued stocks, considering shares fell 25% since January. The company holds more than 40% of the global online payment processing market. That’s double the closest competitor, Stripe, which holds just 21% of the market.', 'Online sale projections indicate that total revenue will climb 65% between now and 2028. In the short term, analysts expect holiday shopping sales to heavily favor online sales (9% growth projections) rather than in-store sales (less than 1% YOY growth). Whether the specific stats bear out remains to be seen. Still, no one denies that digital shopping is at the forefront of consumer shopping. PayPal stands to cement its dominant position as that trend accelerates.', 'PayPal is currently onboarding a slew of new executives and managers in roles that include talent development and even real estate strategies. The company is also realigning efforts along the three lines of consumers, small businesses, and enterprise clients. Each addresses the customer and client segments’ needs better. PayPal is clearly focusing on optimizing operations to match pace with online shopping trends. Today’s streamlining will pay dividends down the road.', 'Source: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com', 'Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) is a surprising pick for a list of undervalued stocks to buy. The company’s financials fly in the face of any reasonable value investment analysis, as they’ve never been profitable despite a rapidly growing user base. But, considering recent developments and imminently strong holiday sales, I think this stock is a solid buy today (if you have the patience).', 'Roblox has been rapidly cutting costs, reducing its net loss by nearly 10% in the most recent quarter compared to last year. And, remember the net bookings we covered above? Roblox’s bookings hit $839.5 million last quarter, nearly 20% higher than last year. At the same time, daily active users climbed by 20%, each contributing an average of $11.96 to net bookings. These strong stats bode well for Roblox, considering its immense popularity within the youth demographic, especially as parents start spending towards digital gifts this season.', 'Source: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.com', 'Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) is in the middle of streamlining its operations. While that creates short-term volatility, it makes today’s shares undervalued in light of future financial prospects. The company is in the middle of divesting its film and television business to focus on what made it great: toys.', 'While the move benefits Hasbro by slicing off an expensive arm of the company’s operations that only contributed 14% to net revenue, there’s more benefit under the hood. The company sold the operational wings for more than $500 million. It plans to use $400 million to retire debt before 2024. Hasbro’s debt-to-equity ratio has consistently floated above 2 for the past five quarters, presenting credit risk as rates rise. Selling its losing entertainment division will improve the company’s position as it pays down debt and cuts costs associated with pricy production.', 'Hasbro shares are down 25% since January. Investors who want to capture holiday sales strength alongside potential capital improvements should jump in now.', 'Source: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com', 'Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY, OTCMKTS:NTDOF) is ready to have a great holiday sales season. The company slashed prices for its popular Switch series and compatible games. In a competitive market where consumers are increasingly price-sensitive, the move will go a long way toward helping Nintendo maintain its strength within the gaming platform industry.', 'But, Nintendo’s long-term prospects make it undervalued today. This year saw a slate of Nintendo news that could make this stock go stratospheric in the coming months. The company’s newest movie, the Super Marios Bros. Movie, generated more than $1.36 billion globally this year.', 'That underscores an important point. Nintendo’s franchising opportunities are huge and largely untapped. Moviemakers, moving on from superhero licensing, could easily pivot to leveraging Nintendo’s intellectual property portfolio and generate tons of money for the gaming company.', 'At the same time, ongoing rumors of a Nintendo/Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) could make this the ultimate stock to buy in 2024. If the supposed collaboration produces the much-anticipated virtual reality platform many expect, Nintendo could quickly become a leader among metaverse stocks.', 'Source: Chie Inoue / Shutterstock.com', 'It wouldn’t be holiday shopping if we didn’t include our furry friends. Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) is among the undervalued stocks ready to benefit from pet-friendly consumer sentiment.', 'Critically, the company is positioned at the top of subscription-based pet services. And, 75% of its sales come from recurring subscriptions. Recurring revenue of that magnitude is a goldmine for companies like Chewy, as it’s usually reliably forecasted for long periods and helps create financial stability and predictability for e-Commerce companies.', 'At the same time, Chewy is spreading its wings to create long-term value beyond its basic offerings. The company is developing an international expansion strategy, which will serve to expand its total addressable market massively. It’s also focusing on its healthcare categories, which helps offset subdued consumer spending for discretionary products like toys and treats.', 'Chewy shares are down 50% since January, making this undervalued stock one to add to your list during holiday stock shopping.', 'On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in SN.

That’s because none have the sustained, long-term success of the Oracle of Omaha. However, there is one stock that Warren Buffet just bought that may come as a shock to you.', 'In the 65 years since he took command of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett generated 3.7 million percent returns for shareholders, a compounded annual growth rate of 20%. In comparison, the S&P 500 returned exactly half that rate. Every year his tens of thousands of devoted followers make a pilgrimage to Omaha to attend the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting to hear the pearls of investing wisdom Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger cast before them.', 'Yet actions speak louder than words and this year’s third-quarter earnings indicated maybe Buffett was feeling more cautious about the economy. A lot of Warren Buffett stocks were sold this quarter. In fact, he sold more than he bought. He completely closed out seven positions, including Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), a stock Buffett’s refused to sell for more than 20 years.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'That may make it more instructive to look at the stocks he bought, including the one stock he purchased that probably shocked a lot of Buffett watchers.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'There is no doubt that many investors did a double-take when they saw Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) pop up on Berkshire Hathaway’s Form 13F filing. The satellite radio operator is not a typical Buffett stock. Yet this isn’t the first time he’s danced with the company. Sirius was first bought back in 2016 and then sold off five years later. Now Buffett’s back in but why?', 'Sirius carries a lot of debt, some $8.8 billion worth. With interest rates at historically high levels, it becomes expensive to refinance any loans. That gives the radio star little wiggle room to maneuver. Still, business is picking up. Advertisers are filtering back in and Sirius reported selling three times more ads in the first nine months of the year than it did for all of last year. Subscriptions are also rising while customer churn remains low.', 'Buffett probably finds Sirius XM’s ability to generate free cash flow (FCF) attractive. Management says it will make $1.5 billion in FCF this year, or just as much as last year. It is also the only satellite radio operator in business. That doesn’t mean as much in a world where listeners can get entertainment from any number of streaming audio providers. Still, Sirius is consistently profitable at it.', 'Is there some arbitrage opportunity as well? Maybe. It’s no secret Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LSXMA)(NASDAQ:LSXMB)(NASDAQ:LSXMK) wants to combine its ownership stake in Sirius to create a new publicly traded entity. Buffett only owns $47 million worth of Sirius stock, so it’s not a large holding, but it still might be one that interests other investors.', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'In addition to bailing on Procter & Gamble, Buffett also completely sold his stake in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). At the end of the second quarter Berkshire Hathaway held only 327,100 shares meaning they were worth approximately $57 million. Still, it’s surprising he shed all of his blue chip’s shares since he’s held it almost as long as he owned P&G.', 'Johnson & Johnson is a solid dividend stock delivering a 3.1% yield. The healthcare company also increases the payout every year, something it has done for 61 consecutive years. That makes it a Dividend King, or a stock that raises the dividend for 50 years or more. Also, we all know how Buffett loves dividends.', 'Yet it’s possible he no longer wanted the risk associated with what is otherwise a very small holding. Johnson & Johnson was inundated with tens of thousands of lawsuits over its baby powder. Trial lawyers attacked the healthcare giant over alleged cancer risk from asbestos-laden talcum powder. Even though J&J maintains its baby powder is safe and the Food & Drug Administration largely confirms that talc products are asbestos-free, the lawsuits mount.', 'Buffett, though, is generating large amounts of money on interest from Berkshire’s burgeoning cash hoard. It had a record $157 billion at the end of September. With short-term treasuries earning over 5.5%, he may see it as easier and safer to earn money backing government notes than with a de minimus stake in Johnson & Johnson. Individual investors, however, can still profit from buying and holding this blue-chip stock.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'Buffett has owned United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) stock just as long as Johnson & Johnson (since 2006), but with only 59,400 shares, it was a tiny stake worth just $10 million. It was the smallest holding in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio and the paperwork upkeep on the stock probably cost more.', 'Okay, maybe not, but it was a position he hadn’t touched one way or another in over a decade. It raises the question again, why now? It could be a manifestation of Buffett’s souring outlook on the economy. UPS stock is down 13% year to date compared to a 19% gain by the S&P 500. Revenue fell 13% in the third quarter while operating profits tumbled 19%. Earnings per share plummeted 47% from last year.', 'The package carrier was one of the beneficiaries of the pandemic. The lockdown phase compelled people to purchase items online instead of going to the store. That led to booming business for UPS. The carrier saw record results during that period, but now it’s on a downswing again. Buffett’s held firm before through such cycles. This time, however, with such a minuscule stake, the money might be better deployed elsewhere.', 'For other investors, however, UPS is still a solid stock to own. It pays a dividend yielding 4.3% annually. With it also trading at 15 times earnings, it’s a level the carrier hasn’t seen in well over a decade.', 'On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in JNJ and PG stock.

Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk)."", ""And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 5.9% last week.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""American Express already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at American Express' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters."", ""Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in American Express. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 21% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.4% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 5.9% of the company stock."", 'After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.', ""While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too."", 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', 'Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of American Express Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$173m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. ', ""With a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over American Express. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run."", ""Public companies currently own 21% of American Express stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership."", 'I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

This is fueled by the travel and entertainment-related transactions, which were severely impacted by the pandemic. With declining restrictions after the pandemic, domestic and cross-border travel surged by a significant margin, signaling a robust recovery in the tourism and hospitality sectors. Revenge travel quickly gained popularity as people sought to make up for lost vacations and experiences, boosting cross-border payments of financial services providers like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc..', 'Per the 2023 Visa Global Travel Intentions Study, the surge in travel post-pandemic is not showing signs of slowing down despite inflationary pressures.

Inflation can act as a double-edged sword for digital payments companies, as higher prices of goods and services can increase the commission earned on transactions. On the flip side, high prices can result in a decline in consumer spending, leading to an overall reduction in payment volumes. However, so far, inflation has not slowed down the current pace of cross-border travel, positively impacting the results of companies in this space.', 'Improving travel numbers coupled with the continued adoption of electronic payments should continue to act as a boon for companies in the digital payments space. Per the 2023 McKinsey Global Payments Report, electronic or digital payments have surpassed overall payment growth, averaging at a five-year rate of 17% versus 6%. Moreover, the e-commerce uprise is also facilitating growth of digital payment companies. E-commerce global volumes are expected to grow 12-15% per year up to 2025. Growth in cross-border e-commerce is also expected to boost cross-border payment volumes.', 'Cross-border payments are a high-margin business, as companies can charge an additional foreign exchange fee, thus complementing its top line. Cross border Peer to Peer transactions grew at a rate of 65% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter for Visa. Cross-border travel volume, excluding intra-Europe, year-over-year growth is expected to be near the low 20s in constant dollars in 2024 for the company.', 'Per the Visa Global Travel Intentions Study, digital wallets are an integral part of the travel journeys for 74% of travelers. The company is also expanding the use of Visa Direct, which proved to be an important revenue driver, marking a 19% year-over-year increase in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023. Visa is collaborating with digital wallet companies in several countries, expanding Visa Direct’s reach to a new plethora of customers. This trend is mostly seen in unbanked countries where digital wallets are gaining traction. With Visa Direct, customers do not require a card or account to receive funds in their wallet, further enhancing its value proposition and adding to the company’s cross-border revenues.', 'Cross-border travel was strong for Mastercard in the third quarter of 2023 at 155% compared with 2019 levels. Both V and MA are expanding to new markets in Africa and the Middle East in an attempt to grow their footprint in those regions and leverage from resurging travel. Resurging travel in China is also expected to benefit payment services companies, as it is one of the last countries to open its borders.

While I certainly don’t want to intentionally promote a doom-and-gloom narrative, it would be wrong to dismiss the idea entirely. For example, the U.K. is facing elevated recession risks, as is the broader European region. Also, Japan’s economy is contracting, raising concerns.', 'True, these are other countries. However, because the global economy has become so interconnected, it’s difficult for any one nation to be fully insulated. Besides, American households already suffer from stubbornly high inflation and simultaneously high borrowing costs.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Now, that doesn’t mean consumer defensive stocks represent a perfect panacea. But if you want to stay in the market during these (potential) troubles, the below ideas offer much confidence.', 'Source: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com', 'Now, before you blast me by pointing out that Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) generally falls under the discretionary sector, I also believe it more than tangentially crosses paths with the traditional defensive consumer stocks. Yes, Ross is where you go to find designer brands at discounted rates. Still, with society actively normalizing, the company will likely rise in relevance.', 'As a relatively recent CNBC article pointed out, the “golden age” of remote work may be coming to an end. If more people are coming back to the office, they’ll likely require an upgrade in the business wardrobe department. Also, not to be rude but we can’t forget that a lot of folks gained unwanted weight during the crisis. So, it’s possible that the wardrobe upgrade represents a matter of necessity.', 'Whatever the reason, the market loves ROST right now, a possible scenario I warned about last month; warned, that is, for bears interested in shorting ROST. With analysts rating shares a strong buy, I think Ross may have some legs left.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational food company, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) makes for a traditional case for defensive consumer stocks to buy. As an added bonus, KHC represents one of the top Warren Buffett stocks to consider. Since the Oracle of Omaha knows a thing or two about navigating various economic cycles, his indirect endorsement of KHC helps instill confidence.', 'However, it’s a riskier enterprise among defensive consumer stocks due to the present volatility. Since the start of the year, KHC gave up more than 14% of equity value. Of course, that’s not comforting. Still, on the other end of the aisle, KHC stormed almost 9% higher in the trailing one-month period. Undergirding sentiment was the company’s third-quarter earnings report, which saw Kraft Heinz beat per-share profitability estimates.', 'Also, management raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance, lifting investors’ opinion on KHC. It’s worth pointing out that the company offers a robust forward dividend yield of 4.58%. Analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $36.65 average price target.', 'Source: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com', 'An oldie but a goodie when it comes to defensive consumer stocks, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is about as inoffensive of an investment as you can get. When you think about it, some of the most alluring growth stories materialized because they were audacious; they ticked people off. Indeed, in the market and in life, you’ve got to be willing to be offensive to stand a chance of shining.', 'Whatever you think about this narrative, that’s not happening with P&G. As a manufacturer of various household goods, the company doesn’t want you to think too much about it. Rather, its main job is to present an attractive, trusted brand that you keep coming back to over and over. It’s hardly a recipe for spiciness but it gets the job done.', 'Financially, P&G’s not remarkable: just keep the nose clean with consistent profitability. In turn, the company offers a forward yield of 2.49%. As well, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $164.24 average price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A multinational confectionary company, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) provides a diverse look for its underlying business. In addition to the sweet stuff, the company specializes in food, beverage and snacks. However, it’s probably best known for the brands that send you to the dentist’s office. For example, the company owns Oreo and Chips Ahoy!, among other delectable goodies.', 'Fundamentally, MDLZ ranks among the top defensive consumer stocks because of the trade-down effect. As you know, sugar and caffeine represent two of the most commonly used substances in Western nations. Frankly, a lot of us need these two vices to help us through the nine-to-five grind. During bull markets, it’s easier to justify going to coffee shops and eateries to have your fill.', 'However, during economic downturns, those same people may turn to the grocery aisles. That’s where Mondelez does its business. Thanks to the company’s consistent profitability, it pays out a forward yield of 2.37%. Also, analysts dig it, pegging shares a strong buy with a $78.67 price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Although trading in the over-the-counter market, Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGF) deserves consideration for defensive consumer stocks to buy. As one of the food and beverage powerhouses, Nestle commands a strong global presence. Among its popular brands are Nespresso, Nescafé, Kit Kat, Smarties, Nesquik, and Stouffer’s, to name but a few. Also, it specializes in other sectors, such as baby, medical, and pet food products.', 'Though exceptionally relevant, Nestle shares have admittedly been all over the map. Undulating throughout this year, NSRGF presently sits about 2% below parity for the year. However, it’s attempting to make a comeback. In the trailing one-month period, it returned stakeholders nearly 4% of equity value.', 'To be fair, NSRGF isn’t exactly a discount, trading at 27.72x trailing-year earnings. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 18.95x. Nevertheless, it enjoys a long history of robust earnings going back to at least 2008. Also, its revenue picked up significantly last year. Analysts also rate shares a moderate buy with a $131.36 price target, implying over 15% growth.', 'Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com', 'Arguably a no-brainer among defensive consumer stocks, Kroger (NYSE:KR) represents a grocery stalwart. As such, it’s hardly a sexy enterprise. When you acquire shares of KR, you’re not necessarily doing so to get rich quick. Rather, you’re banking on a consistent revenue and earnings stream. No matter who you are, you’re going to require the essentials.', 'To be fair, though, KR hasn’t excited investors even with the permanently relevant narrative. Since the start of the year, the security slipped almost 1% below parity. Nevertheless, the red ink also makes for an intriguing discounted opportunity. Right now, shares trade hands at only 9.79x forward earnings. For context, the underlying retail defensive sector features a median forward earnings multiple of 14.47x.', 'It also trades at a discount relative to trailing-year revenue. As an added bonus, Kroger offers a forward yield of 2.63%, along with a payout ratio of 26.45%. Therefore, investors shouldn’t have to worry too much about yield sustainability.', 'Lastly, analysts peg KR a moderate buy with a $52.75 target, projecting over 19% upside.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'On paper, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) appears one of the most relevant ideas for defensive consumer stocks. While the food processing and commodities trading firm doesn’t directly interface with consumers, its offerings undergird myriad consumer brands. Indeed, we wouldn’t be able to talk about the subject of consumer defensive ideas without ADM and its ilk.', 'Unfortunately, relevance alone hasn’t exactly helped Archer Daniels Midland. Since the start of the year, ADM lost more than 17% of equity value. In the past 52 weeks, it slipped almost 24%. To be sure, its Q3 earnings report didn’t help the fundamental narrative. While the company’s profit beat on ethanol margins, certain key segments lagged expectations, per Reuters.', 'Still, for the contrarians, ADM could be appealing. Right now, shares trade at 11.07x forward earnings, below the sector median of 15.3x. In addition, the business is consistently profitable, leading to a forward yield of 2.42%.

We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.5b.
