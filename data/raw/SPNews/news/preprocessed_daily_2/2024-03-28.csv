If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on the common mistakes that drain retirees' savings, you may go to 10 Careless Ways Retirees Waste Their Savings."", 'According to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), the financial services industry frequently paints the picture of retirement as a journey toward ""income replacement"". Potential retirees spend their working years accumulating a substantial nest egg so that when they retire, they may begin to derive income from their investments. While the process seems relatively straightforward, the reality paints a stark contrast. This is because the investment landscape is quite tumultuous, considering the S&P 500 Index is currently undergoing its most significant correction since 2020, as noted by Smart Asset. What should potential retirees do to navigate such landscapes? According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), an esteemed investment firm, diversification is one way to go about such investment landscapes.', 'For many individuals, adopting these measures on their own is a complex task. Drawing insights from its Preferred Choice Retirement Accounts (PCRAs), a self-directed brokerage account residing within defined contribution retirement plans, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) unveils shocking statistics about how taking help from financial advisors can prove to be financially rewarding. In the first quarter of 2022, participants who had the help of financial advisors boasted an average balance of $535,354. This figure starkly contrasts with the $286,008 average balance among non-advised participants. This contrast also attempts to highlight the substantial advantage brought by expert financial guidance, thereby bringing us to the conclusion that one of the biggest financial mistakes retirees make is underestimating the role of financial advisors in retirement planning.', 'According to a recent BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) report, recent retirees are reporting higher levels of anxiety and pessimism than those who have been retired for ten or more years (63% vs. 58%). Among the top concerns that such recent retirees have is that of healthcare and major investment loss. Rightly so, the BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) report reveals that one in three recent retirees (32%) believe it would be emotionally difficult to bear an investment loss, as opposed to one in four of those who have been retired for longer.', '“For too many people, investing and retirement planning are all about an intangible future. But what we found is that there are immediate benefits for those who start early. Much as physical exercise has both short- and long-term benefits, focusing on retirement planning helps alleviate stress and improves your overall well-being today.”', '- BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) President Robert Kapito.', ""With that said, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) rightly asserts that working with a financial advisor can help savers work up a suitable strategy for their finances. This in turn helps alleviate some of the stress associated with working towards their retirement goals. For what it’s worth, maneuvering through the financial vortex as highlighted by Goldman Sachs means individuals may not have enough to spare for professional advice. Indeed, their report sheds light on a significant finding: nearly half of working respondents (47%) opt to manage their retirement savings independently. What's particularly striking about this statistic, as revealed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), is not just that the retirees are self-managing, but the alarming lack of financial literacy among this demographic. Only 13% of respondents managed to answer all financial literacy questions correctly, exposing a concerning gap in understanding and preparedness."", 'This brings us to the significance of financial literacy in preparing for retirement. Saving for retirement is a long road, so it’s only wise that these savings are managed wisely. With that said, let’s check out all the careless ways retirees waste their savings so that such pitfalls can be consciously avoided.', 'A brokerage employee huddled with a group of retirees discussing retirement portfolios.', 'To compile the list of careless ways retirees waste their savings, we began with a meticulous review of forums, surveys, and comparable secondary sources. Each identified oversight was counted as a point, facilitating the ranking of careless ways from least to most prevalent based on accumulated scores. These mistakes were then ranked in an ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Here are the 30 careless ways retirees waste their savings:', 'Insider Monkey Score: 7', 'According to a 2023 Retirement Confidence Survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 49% of retirees stated that their overall spending is higher than they had expected it to be. The EBRI survey revealed that while 33% and 29% of retirees were overspending on healthcare and housing, 29% were overspending on travel and entertainment.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 9', 'According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, people aged 65 and above spend nearly twice as much of their total expenditure on healthcare costs when compared with the general population. Neglecting healthcare leads to a further deterioration of health, in turn leading to increased costs in the long run.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 11', ""Next up on our list of careless ways retirees waste their savings is failing to downsize. When retirees don't downsize, they miss opportunities to cut down on many of their expenses such as utilities, maintenance, property taxes, and even mortgage or rent payments."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 13', 'Retirees are often found to be more vulnerable to scams, possibly because of social, emotional, and cognitive problems. Due to reasons such as dementia or cognitive impairment, a senior may fail to use good judgment and possibly get lured in by financial scams. The best way to avoid losing money is to consult a trustworthy family member, or consistently educating oneself regarding these scams.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 15', ""Making a large purchase or remodeling one's home early on in retirement may feel safe but it can put a big dent in retirement savings. Retirees must not indulge in extravagant behavior since they don't always have new income sources to replenish their nest eggs."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 19', 'Dining out is a luxury that should be availed now and then. However, turning this into a habit can turn out to be one of the many careless ways retirees waste their savings. Home-cooked meals are better not just because they are healthy, but also because they make your savings last longer.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 21', ""Retirement is not the time to go all in. It's the opposite. Since your investments are all that you depend on, there should be less risk in your portfolio than before. A financial advisor can help you offer the best advice based on your financial situation."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 23', 'When retirees are ignorant of tax implications, they end up paying more taxes than necessary. They also miss out on various potential tax-saving opportunities. Here are 13 overlooked tax deductions for retirees that could save them money.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 25', 'Another one of the careless ways retirees waste their savings is by overlooking senior discounts. Retirees may not know that there may be many potential senior discounts that they are missing. While it may take a little research, it saves them a lot of money in the long run.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 27', 'A financial advisor helps individuals by optimizing retirement savings and investment portfolios. Neglecting the help of such advisors can lead to costly financial mistakes, and even missed out chances to maximize wealth.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 29', 'One of the biggest financial mistakes retirees make is underestimating the impact inflation can have on their savings. When a retiree fails to estimate the impact of inflation, they end up setting unrealistic withdrawal rates and risk losing their money faster.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 31', 'Another careless way retirees waste their savings is failing to compare prices. Comparing the prices of items such as food, clothes, and other items of purchase across different places can help retirees find the best bargains and potentially save a lot of money.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 33', 'By failing to tap into community resources and services, retirees tend to miss out on availing services and resources that they could have obtained either at a discount or even free.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 35', 'Having multiple cars means car payments for more than one, more insurance, more maintenance, and more fuel costs. This is why once you enter retirement and have a fixed income, downgrading to a single reliable car is best.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 37', ""One of the biggest expenses in retirement can come from travel and entertainment. We're not saying retirees shouldn't splurge every once in a while, but careful planning and traveling to budget vacation destinations can help use less of your nest egg."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 39', ""Owning multiple homes means you are wasting your savings on extra maintenance costs, real estate taxes, and more. This is why it's advised to keep a single home in your golden years."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 41', ""Choosing the wrong state, city, or retirement plan for retirement can result in paying excessive taxes beyond what is necessary. This is why retirees favor states like Florida and Texas which are the best states that don't tax retirement income, have favorable costs of living, and offer a comparatively lower overall tax burden."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 43', ""Similar to neglecting your health, disregarding home maintenance can lead to significant costs accumulating over time. This is one of the many careless ways retirees waste their savings. To avoid this, it's important to deal with home maintenance as and when it occurs."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 44', 'Retirees often stay invested in life insurance products they are no longer getting any value from. This is another one of the careless ways retirees waste their savings.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 45', 'Being a senior means often becoming forgetful of stuff you brought, services you subscribed to, or memberships that you once enjoyed. The continued usage of such memberships and subscriptions is a major way retirees risk diminishing their nest eggs.', 'Click to continue reading and see the 10 Careless Ways Retirees Waste Their Savings.', 'Suggested Articles:', '15 Best Places in Alabama for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security', '15 Best Places in Pennsylvania for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security', '11 Best Healthcare ETFs To Buy Now', 'Disclosure: none. 30 Careless Ways Retirees Waste Their Savings\xa0is originally published on Insider Monkey.']"

Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Nucor insiders own 0.6% of the company, currently worth about US$290m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders."", ""Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 3, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This lighting maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.3%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $899.34 million, down 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Acuity Brands?', ""For Acuity Brands, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.11%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Acuity Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Acuity Brands would post earnings of $3.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.72, delivering a surprise of +20.39%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir."", 'Jared S. Mattingley', ""Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2024 third quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now turn the call over to Todd."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Thank you, Jared. Due to the outstanding dedication and execution of our employees, whom we call partners, we delivered very strong results for our third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 9.9% to $2.41 billion. The revenue dollars represent record quarterly revenue. We are pleased with the performance of each of our businesses. Our revenue growth remains robust and we have good momentum in the business.New business remains strong. Our sales team continues to operate at a high level. We are seeing broad success across the many verticals, particularly within our focus verticals as well as our cross-selling efforts and penetration of new products and services within our existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels. Our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the third quarter increased 220 basis points to a record 49.4%, an increase of 14.9%. Operating income was a record 21.6%, an increase of 16.6%.Diluted EPS grew a robust 22.3% to $3.84. Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter grew 32.8% over the prior year. In the third quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses through capital expenditures of $107 million.During the third quarter, we made acquisition purchases of $111 million. On March 15, we paid shareholders $137.6 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous March. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital and through 3 quarters, we have deployed over $1.4 billion of capital across our priorities of capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and buybacks.I would like to thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion to a range of $9.57 billion to $9.6 billion, a total growth rate of 8.6% to 8.9%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.35 to $14.65 to a range of $14.80 to $15, a growth rate of 13.9% to 15.5%. Mike?"", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 third quarter revenue was $2.41 billion compared to $2.19 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a difference in the number of workdays, was 7.7%. Total growth was positively impacted by 170 basis points due to the extra workday. We remind you as you update your models for next fiscal year that there will be 2 less workdays compared to this current fiscal year.Each quarter next year, we'll have 65 workdays, which means the first and the fourth quarters will each have 1 less workday than this fiscal year. Organic growth by business was 7.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 11.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 13.9% for Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale was down 3.9%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.19 billion compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 14.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.4% for the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47.2% last year, an increase of 220 basis points.Strong volume growth, technology improvements and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 56.3% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% of Fire Protection Services and 41.1% for Uniform Direct sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 170 basis points from last year. Energy was a tailwind of 40 basis points. In addition, we continue to leverage our strong revenue growth, our technology investments and extract inefficiencies out of the business through our Six Sigma and engineering teams.Our technology investments have allowed us to improve garment sharing among our plants, which improves material cost. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide route densities to our existing routes, which positively impacts truck purchasing, labor and energy. Our Six Sigma and engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our plant equipment, labor and energy.Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 470 basis points from last year. Strong revenue growth continues to help expand our margins in this segment. Strong revenue performance in some of our high-margin recurring revenue products like AED Rentals, Eyewash Stations and WaterBreak continues to provide a healthy revenue mix. Our technology investment in SmartTruck continues to provide route optimization and improved efficiencies. And our First Aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contribute to improved gross margins.Selling and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points from last year. The increase was driven by investments in selling resources, technology and our management trainee program as well as costs associated with an agreement in principle to settle the purported class action contract dispute brought by Plaintiff, City of Laurel. We determined that settling the claim is in the best interest of Cintas. The total monetary payment agreed to in the proposed settlement, including the 60 basis points recognized in this quarter is $45 million.We expect that the settlement costs will not impact our financials in future periods. As Todd mentioned earlier, we generated strong cash flow. For the year, our free cash flow increased 31.6%. This has allowed us to invest back into the business, which has resulted in capital expenditures of 4.3% for the year. Our investments include technology to grow the top line and expand margins automation to improve efficiencies in our plants and additional processing capacity where needed. We expect capital expenditures to finish around 4.25% of revenue for the year. Operating income of $520.8 million compared to $446.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.6% in the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.4% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the third quarter was $397.6 million compared to $325.8 million last year. This year's third quarter diluted EPS of $3.84 compared to $3.14 last year, an increase of 22.3%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $99 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.6%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23.Our guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, we expect that the proposed settlement will not impact our financials in future periods. And accordingly, there is no impact on our guidance. Guidance includes $17.4 million of acquired revenue for the fourth quarter. This revenue includes the impact of the recently announced acquisitions during the third quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks."", 'Jared S. Mattingley', 'Now we are happy to answer your questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We will now take our first question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is [Ronan Kennedy] on for Manav. Can I just ask with regards to the strong margin performance, could you kind of assess or characterize the contributions from whether it's the SmartTruck, the Six Sigma, the engineering, extracting of inefficiencies, but also how we should think about those as drivers in the context of the sustainability of the margins, if you could elaborate on that, please?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Thank you for your question, Ronan. When you think about the gross margin, it really starts with our culture, how we run our business, the expectations we have, the intensity of which we run it and the focus. That being said, there are many, many inputs to those numbers. Certainly, our investments that we are making are paying off, the investments in SmartTruck, the investments in our Six Sigma team, the investment in our engineering team, the investment in our supply chain organization are all helping us to improve those results. So I can't give you an exact number with hey, SmartTruck gave us X basis points, what have you. There are many inputs and we're pleased with the investments that we've made, and we're pleased with the leadership and the culture of the organization where they're focused on driving those results, providing a better experience for our customers and providing a better experience for our employee partners."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""That's helpful. And then with regards to obviously strong performance on the top line as well, can you just talk about the contributions from new business and penetration versus expectations, how pricing is trending and also retention, please?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes. Good question. So when we think about our growth, again, there's many contributing factors. We really like where we are from a growth standpoint. The internal growth, certainly -- we like the acquisitions that we've made, really good businesses. But when we think about the components of it, certainly, pricing is a component, but it is not the majority. The majority of our growth is from volume growth and that's really pleasing to us because we want to be able to grow our business in that manner. Pricing has moderated and it's much closer to historical. And that's exactly what we had planned throughout the year. Where we're really benefiting is from our new business. Our team is performing at a high level. Our service organization is -- the retention levels are very attractive. And then we're cross-selling appropriately. We have a great breadth of products and services that we want to make sure that our customers and our prospects are aware of. And so we're benefiting kind of across all -- that kind of -- we are benefiting across all of those areas and they're all big contributing factors. But we like where we are, and we like how we're growing the business."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS.', 'Joshua K. Chan', ""Could you talk about the -- I guess, piggybacking on the prior question, could you talk about the sustainability of growth that you're seeing, now that pricing has moderated to a historical level. Do you see the current run rate staining based on what you're seeing out there talking to customers and retention rate dynamics and all that?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes, Josh. Again, we like where we are from a growth standpoint. The exciting thing is there's -- we service a little over 1 million customers. There are 16 million businesses in North America. We think there's an incredible runway for us. So we're selling to -- about 60% of our new accounts come from no-programmers and that is continuing. So we're seeing great results from talking to prospects and showing them a better way to do it than they are today.Now that doesn't necessarily mean that, that is new spend. They might be spending that money somehow. It's just we're redirecting it to do it better, smarter, faster, in some cases, even less expensive than the way they're doing it. So we think the runway is very attractive because of the number of prospects that are out there and our business -- or excuse me, our buying proposition resonating with prospects and customers. So we expect that we like where we are from a growth standpoint. As I mentioned, we like how we're growing, and we want to continue in that manner."", 'Joshua K. Chan', ""That's great color. And for my follow-up, you talked about incremental margins being in the 20% to 30% range historically. And now you're sort of at the higher end of that in recent years. Is this the right level of incremental margins going forward on revenue growth that comes ahead."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes. Well, we recognize the math of 20% to 30% incremental margins. We need to be at the higher end of that in order to continue to improve our margins and we're focused on doing that. We're doing so by extracting out those inefficiencies, getting really good leverage on our revenue growth, so many, many ways. But running a business is not linear. And so we know there's going to be some puts and takes and some quarters will be higher and some won't be as high. But generally speaking, we like that range and I prefer the higher end than the lower end. That's for sure."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America.', 'Heather Nicole Balsky', 'I was hoping if you could just talk about the M&A you did this quarter, kind of what attracted you to the assets? And then just an update on how to think about M&A going forward.', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""I'm certainly happy to start, Mike -- Heather regarding M&A. So it's an important component for us. You certainly cannot pace M&A. So they kind of come as they do, and it takes 2 to dance. But I can tell you the 2 that we announced this past quarter are great businesses, first off, really good operators, really attractive businesses. In the case of the one in Kentucky, it provided us with some needed capacity in that region of the country.In addition to the added capacity, we were able to absorb that volume into 7 of our facilities. So some really nice synergies allows us to -- as we're closer to the customers to spend more time with the customer and less time driving. So that's important to us. In the case of the acquisition in the M&A in Pennsylvania, we did not acquire any additional capacity. But in that case, we were able to absorb it into 16 of our facilities. So again, attractive synergies, more time with the customer, less time driving. In those cases, we also then get to talk to our new customers about the broader breadth of products and services that we have. So we think it's -- overall, it's very attractive. As I mentioned, it takes 2 to dance. You can't pace it. But in this case, these were 2 really attractive businesses, great operators that really made sense for us."", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Maybe a couple of added points. As Todd said, these are great acquisitions, and we've had a handful of them this fiscal year. Each of the 2 that Todd talked about is less than $20 million in annual revenue. The $17.4 million that we gave you in our prepared remarks, includes the impact of those. But keeping in mind, we've made acquisitions all year long. And so that fourth quarter impact would include all of the acquisitions we've made throughout the last 12 months. Just something to keep in mind as you're thinking about our fourth quarter."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from R.W. Baird. (Operator Instructions)', 'Andrew John Wittmann', ""I'm sorry about that. Mike, I just want to build on that last question where you were commenting on the M&A contribution. Is there any in your fourth quarter guidance, is there a change in your fundamental outlook for the company, recognizing that it is up now somewhat on these 2 -- somewhat larger acquisitions that you did? And then as an addendum to that, was this 60 basis points or $45 million legal settlement that you just talked about, was that included and considered in your initial guidance? Or are you absorbing that and still able to raise your guidance here?"", 'J. Michael Hansen', 'Yes. So Andy, I already forgot your first part of the question. What was your first part?', 'Andrew John Wittmann', 'First question is your fundamental outlook for business unchanged -- is your fundamental outlook unchanged for 4Q? Or is there a change...?', 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Yes, I apologize. No. As Todd talked about. Our market remains very large. The momentum in the business remains good. The adoption remains good. And the guide for the fourth quarter is right where we want to be in terms of sort of the stated profile of growth that we want to have. And so all of that put together with not really any change in customer behavior would mean, no continued performance like we've seen, and we continue to like the momentum of the business.As it relates to your second question, the 60 basis points, that was not contemplated in the initial guide from the beginning of the year, and that was simply absorbed through -- well, in this third quarter, the 60 basis points simply absorbed."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.', 'Keen Fai Tong', 'Can you provide an update on the external selling environment, including how client budgets and sales cycles are performing?', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes. I'm certainly happy to start, George. We haven't really seen much of a change in sales cycle. As far as our -- the interest in our products and services remains good. We're always continuing to invest in new products and services, tweaks, I guess, certainly to them to make it as attractive to the prospects and the customers as possible. But we're not seeing a change. Momentum continues to be good, outsourcing still resonates.And we're seeing, as I mentioned earlier, the new program market is -- it's still really, really large, and we've become pretty darn proficient at and presenting to those prospects to help them run a better business. And we help them with all the products and services we provide. And as I mentioned, it's not always new money. Usually, they're spending something is just redirecting it to us to do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper type thing."", 'Keen Fai Tong', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then separately, can you talk a little bit about your focus verticals, including health care? How much additional runway is there for these focus verticals to serve as a tailwind to organic revenue growth?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes. So George, so it's in our internal growth. So it is helping us. That focus is helping us to organize around the customer and provide the products and services that they want and that has been a good strategy for us over the past number of years. So we like all the verticals we're in. We find them very attractive whether it's health care, hospitality, education, state, local government business, it's all attractive, and we're organized around it, and our value proposition is resonating with them."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is [Lu McCann] on for Tim Mulrooney. So I wanted to ask 2, just on first -- I'll start with the first one and then move on to the second one after. But First Aid and Safety has been growing at a double-digit rate for quite a few quarters in a row now. I know there's a penetration story here with your established base of Uniform customers. But I'm also curious if new product introductions are an important driver of this growth. How much of your growth in that segment is from new product introductions?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Luke. We really like the First Aid business, part of our culture is continued innovation. So we're always looking at improving our processes, improving our products, improving our services. So it's always a component. I cannot give you a number of, hey, it was X basis points of growth due to a product rollout or what have you. But I can tell you this, the value proposition in the First Aid business and all of our businesses. But First Aid, as you asked about, it's really resonating. And the mix of business that we have there is really good. And we're able to be better sourcers, better providers of products with our investment in our distribution center. So when you have a robust supply chain that allows us to get products to the customers in a really timely fashion, it puts us in a great spot to be successful. So yes, cross-sell, we're absolutely -- we want all of our customers, whether they're uniform or fire or a direct sale customer, we want them all to know about our First Aid business. And we try to make sure that, that occurs in many different conduits, but it's -- yes, we're benefiting from that cross-sell."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Understood. Really helpful. And maybe just sticking on First Aid and Safety here. As you think about that segment of your business, does it feel like you've essentially built out the full suite of products and services there? Or at some point, should we expect to potentially hear more about other product introductions as you continue to build out the portfolio? Is the room here for more is essentially what I'm curious to know."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes, Luke. Yes, again, I'll go back to our culture. Our culture is such that we are constantly innovating and pushing ourselves to be -- to provide the best products and services. And so you'll see more of that to come. We're constantly innovating to put our partners in the best position, our employee partners in the best position to provide the most value for our customers."", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""And maybe one added comment, Luke, when we think about this business, you may have heard us speak to umbrellas of image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. And when we think about this business, safety is a fairly large umbrella. And when our First Aid and Safety people are speaking with customers and thinking about that innovation that Todd talked about, we're thinking quite broadly about how do we keep our customers, how do we help our customers keep their employees safe and that can mean opportunities into the future. And that's the way we look at it from a broad perspective."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities.', 'Andrew Charles Steinerman', 'In the quarter, when you look at your rentals and Facility Services segment, how much of the growth is actually coming from Uniforms versus Ancillary services? And directionally, like is there good growth in both? And also, if you can make a comment about ad stops within Uniforms.', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Andrew, as you know, we don't give out those specific numbers. But directionally, to your question, yes, we're seeing growth across them at all. There's good demand for our uniform business and our facility services business, frankly, for all of our business products and services. So nothing to point out to one particular area there. As far as add-stops, there's a -- we haven't really seen a change to our customer behavior there. So it's, I'll call it, kind of business as usual. There are many inputs to that number. But nevertheless, I'd say it's kind of business as usual."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities.', 'Jasper James Bibb', ""I wanted to follow up on the earlier discussion on First Aid. The gross margin there was really impressive at 56% this quarter, but you also had SG&A up 25% from the prior year. So could you provide just maybe a bit of color on the investments you're making in that business? And when do you think the First Aid segment should start to deliver a bit more margin leverage over that SG&A base."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes, Jasper, as I mentioned, we really like the business, and it's performing really well and we're investing appropriately. The amount of prospects out there are massive. And to Mike's point earlier, the value proposition is resonating. We talk about the mantra in that business is what's more important to a business than the health and safety of their employees and their customers.So that is resonating. We're in a great position to invest to provide those products and services. So we're doing just that. And so we're investing in selling resources. We're investing in marketing resources because we really like where we are and it makes sense to invest. And I think you're seeing it show up in the operating margin and the gross margin."", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Yes. Each quarter this year has been 22% or higher, which is quite a big improvement from a year ago. And so as Todd said, we want to continue to invest in the long-term growth of all of our businesses, and you can really see those investments playing out particularly in the gross margin line of First Aid and Safety. But we love the margins. They're up quite a bit over the last few years, and we'll continue to invest as we see appropriate."", 'Jasper James Bibb', ""It makes sense. And then just I was hoping to get an update on what you're seeing for expense growth on labor and fleet-related costs in the quarter."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Jasper, good question. Certainly, labor is an important component. We want to make sure that we're providing attractive wages, competitive wages. And we've spoken on previous calls that we were not flat-footed when it came to the wage inflation that I'd say North America has seen over the past few years. So we've been in a good position, and we like where we are from that perspective. And here's what's really exciting is we have -- I mentioned earlier, our Six Sigma teams, our engineering teams, they're helping us to automate certain items to bring transformation technology to portions of our business, whether it's SmartTruck or plant efficiencies that allows us to mitigate that subject as best as possible.And so we're investing and have invested for years in those organizations, and it's paying off and what we're seeing with our total labor costs as we manage through and make sure we're still in a really good spot to be competitive and attract the very best people."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC.', 'Ashish Sabadra', ""I just wanted to focus on the Google partnership. I was wondering if you can provide an update on that front. I believe you've already migrated your SAP onto the GCP and how should we think about those benefits that you may have seen in the quarter, but also benefits as we go forward?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Good question, Ashish. I would characterize -- well, first off, we have a great relationship with Google. You're correct. We did migrate to the Google Cloud platform. And I would characterize it as we're in the early innings there. And so we certainly hope to maximize our relationship and put our employee partners in a position to provide more value and to be as successful as possible because we believe there are tools that will be available to us to provide more value to the customers and to put our people in a better position to provide that value, which makes them more successful. So early innings, but we're optimistic about where that can go."", 'Ashish Sabadra', ""That's very helpful color. And if I can ask a quick accounting clarifying question. So in the balance sheet, the Uniform and other rental items and service that moderated sequentially quarter-to-quarter. I was just wondering, if you can provide any color on what's driving that? Is that better efficiency or anything on that front?"", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Yes, Todd talked a little bit about how we are working on all pieces of the business, but certainly one of those is inventory and he touched on a little bit of garment sharing. So you can think about when we improve garment sharing, for example, we don't need to inject as many new garments into that in-service inventory. So the more sharing means better utilization of our existing in-service inventory. And it means we don't have to add as much into the in-service inventory from new purchases.That's one of the areas. Certainly, though, there are others like improved sourcing as well. Volume growth, as Todd said, remains really strong. And so what we're seeing is some nice offsetting of the volume growth with some of these initiatives."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.', 'Stephanie Lynn Benjamin Moore', ""I wanted to continue the discussion on the pretty impressive margin front for the quarter. I appreciate the color in terms of kind of discussing the route optimization, the merchandise management, Six Sigma and the likes. But maybe if you could provide a little bit of color of your major initiatives, which ones you think are kind of still in the early innings where we could kind of continue to see some more improvement or accelerated improvement. And then maybe taking it a step further, what is next for you guys in terms of other areas of opportunity that haven't been as major focus yet."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""From our strategic initiatives that we're focused on how can we impact our business in total, certainly our material costs, our energy, our labor. And Mike referred to earlier, our energy spend is down 40 basis points. But that's not all just price. Those initiatives that we referred to earlier, the material cost is a -- our 2 largest costs, our material cost and labor. So we're very focused on driving efficiencies in all those areas because to Mike's earlier point, we love the volume growth, but we don't want to sacrifice margin because of the volume growth is so robust that we've got these strategic initiatives to extract these inefficiencies out of our business. And I wouldn't speak to anyone in particular that it's in the earlier innings or the others.We've got a nice runway for forward for doing that. A little bit of that is our culture is that we're constantly trying to innovate and push ourselves to be better. So I think you'll see that continue. As far as acceleration, it's built in. We're constantly doing it. So I think we're focused on -- there are incremental margins and this is an important component of making sure we can hit those numbers."", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Yes. The only thing I might add is we are certainly in the very early innings of technology and we believe there's a nice runway there. Todd talked about just the recent migration to the Google Cloud and that creates a foundation for us to do some interesting things moving forward."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.', 'Daniel Erik Hultberg', ""It's Daniel on for Scott. Could you please speak to the outlook for Uniform Direct Sales and Fire Protection as well as some perspective on the margins for All Other going forward, please?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""I'll start on the outlook. And Mike, if you want to speak to the margins. The Uniform Direct Sale business is a strategic business for us. We have some really large strategic accounts, whether it's national accounts or in the hospitality, gaming area of our business. And so a strategic meaning that those customers spend a lot more money with us not just with garment direct sale but also outside of that.So that's important. That being said, that business certainly can be a little lumpy due to the nature of it with rollouts and purchases. But we like where we're positioned there. We like the value proposition where we are there. So we think the outlook is very positive there. As far as the fire business, it's been a great business for us. The results over the last several years, we've seen great revenue growth. We've seen great margin improvement. And it's the only business we're in where you legally have to have those products and services. So we think it's -- the outlook is really positive because of the prospects that are out there and the runway we see for opportunity. So Mike, if you want to comment on margin?"", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Sure. So as Todd said, the fire business, in particular, the margins have increased quite a bit in the last handful of years and we've seen a lot of the same initiatives and other initiatives specific to that business really take off like we've seen in our other businesses. The one thing I might point out there, we did see some increase in SG&A in the fire business year-over-year, and we're starting to get into that SAP implementation for the fire business.So we might see a little bit of pressure as we move into fiscal '25 on the fire margins, the overall margins because of that investment in that move. But as you've seen with our rental and First Aid and Safety businesses, once we understand how to use that and get proficient at it, it can create some really nice opportunities. So maybe a little bit of -- we've seen some great improvement, maybe a little bit of next year and the following year pressure on SG&A because of that implementation.But we certainly expect those margins to continue to improve in the longer term from a Uniform Direct Sale margin perspective. As Todd said, that business is going to go up and down. It's going to be a little bit bumpy from quarter to quarter. And because of that, the margins will be as well. So I don't think there's anything specific to call out other than it isn't quite as consistent of a business as the other 3 that we have."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel, Nicolaus.', 'Shlomo H. Rosenbaum', ""Todd, can you talk a little bit about the macro environment with regard to employment and specifically, if you could touch upon some of the areas where they're looking for more automation to reduce the employment due to raises in minimum wage in areas like California, are you -- how exposed are you to those kind of verticals? And then after that, I have a follow-up."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes, from a macro environment, as I mentioned, we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior. Certainly, there's always some puts and takes. And as you mentioned, our employers under pressure to figure out ways to automate things because wage inflation that has occurred and will continue to occur. It's occurred for many, many years. Now there is also some -- the infrastructure bills that are out there, the onshoring, I can't speak to specifics of, oh, boy, we're benefiting from this or this is a headwind here. But generally, we like the spot we're in. And we think it's the macro environment where -- it's been reasonably stable. And that's -- we find that attractive and we can be really successful in that environment."", 'Shlomo H. Rosenbaum', 'Just for a follow-up, you have a competitor there that was spun out, say, 6 months ago, and I was just wondering, has there been any change in the environment with them competitively in terms either positively or negatively? I mean have you seen any changes in the way that they bid? Are you taking more business from them? Maybe you could just comment in general.', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes. Shlomo, I would characterize it's pretty well business as usual. They're a very good competitor, always have been. I'm sure they always will be, and we have a great deal of respect for them, and it's a very competitive environment. It always has been as far as -- as long as I've been with the company, it has been, and I'm sure it will be in the future. But we're focused on putting our employee partners in the best position to be successful in providing our customers the best value proposition. So really, none of that has changed."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.', 'Kartik Mehta', ""Todd, you have been able to execute extremely well this year, beat guidance. And as you look at the business, is that the result of maybe metrics like nonprogrammers being a little bit better than you thought? Is it sales being better than you thought? Maybe you're just more cautious about the economy that actually happened. If you look at why you've been able to do better, what would you point to?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes. Kartik, it starts with our culture and our expectations of our employee partners and the pace and the intensity of which they run. But that being said, our value proposition is really resonating and each of the businesses we're in, the First Aid business, we spoke about it's very good. Outsourcing is resonating nicely.Maybe it has to do with -- it's not as easy to hire people as it has been in the past. So if you want someone to outsource it, it's that much more attractive. We like the spot we're in. And we have exceeded our internal expectations and we're pleased with that. But we're -- it's -- there are so many inputs to it because we're trying to focus on providing better products, better services, better technologies to make our people more successful and to make our customers that much happier.So a lot of inputs, but we like where we're positioned and we're continuing to invest for the future."", 'Kartik Mehta', ""And just 1 follow-up. You obviously discussed M&A a lot. I'm wondering, and I know some of these acquisitions can take years to come to fruition. But as you look at the market today, are you seeing any change in the pricing environment, maybe what expectations are from sellers? Or has it remained about the same?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes, Kartik, good question. I wouldn't speak to any change there. It's more about certain events might cause them, whether it's an owner's age or succession or there's many different life events that would cause them to make a move. And it's more about that. To your point, it's in certain cases, these are decades in the making. And you can't really pace them. But when they are ready, we're ready. And we are highly acquisitive, very interested in M&A from all shapes and sizes, big, little, medium, everything in between, we think it's -- we're very interested."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.', 'Toni Michele Kaplan', 'I wanted to ask a question on the focus verticals. Are you able to share sort of the growth between focused verticals versus non-focused ones? And how do you assess whether to add a new vertical into that sort of focused designation? Is there a different go-to-market strategy for focused verticals as well?', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Well, I'll say this about our focused verticals. I certainly expect them to grow faster than the business in general. And when you have an organized approach in your eyes around customer base, you certainly expect that. And we've chosen what we think are really good verticals that are very attractive. So yes, I can't give you a specific of, boy, it's adding X amount of basis points to our total growth, but we think we've chosen well.And we're always analyzing what should we have another one or should we not? And what's the best way and it really gets down to what puts our employee partners in the best position to be successful and what creates the most value for the customer base. So we're looking -- we're evaluating always doing that, but we like where our investment is at this point."", 'Toni Michele Kaplan', ""Terrific. I wanted to also ask about your marketing budget and whether you've increased that year-over-year. I recently heard some Cintas commercials on Bloomberg Radio, for example. Just wondering if that's coincidence or if there's been a greater push towards more marketing?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes, Toni. First off, thank you. I'm glad to hear that. The algorithm is working, and it's hitting our target audience. So I wouldn't say there's been a step change there. It's just trying to be -- make sure our investment is well placed, and we're trying to leverage analytics and technology to make sure that the investment is deriving the very best ROI as possible. So it's just a matter of tweaks versus a step change in investment."", 'Operator', ""At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks."", 'Jared S. Mattingley', ""Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter of fiscal '24 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

Several high-profile companies have split their shares over the past few years, and after a short lull, stock splits are back in fashion. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) split its stock in February on a 3-for-1 split, and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) made a stunning announcement last week that it's splitting its stock in a 50-for-1 split, one of the largest splits ever."", 'Investors love stock splits, and both of these stocks got a boost after their announcements. But which one is the better buy?', 'Both Walmart and Chipotle gave similar reasons for splitting their stocks at this time. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said, ""Sam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates."" He said that now was the right to encourage employee participation, given the company\'s growth plans.', 'Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung said, ""We believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors"" and added that this was the right time considering Chipotle\'s record revenue and profits.', ""In general, companies split their stocks because high price tags can intimidate investors and make them feel priced out. Some investors also have specific criteria that a too-high price tag won't meet, or a limited amount of funds to invest regardless of valuation."", ""Walmart has been demonstrating why it's the leading U.S. retailer in the country by sales. Despite its already immense size, revenue increased 6% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were up from $6.29 in 2023 to $6.62 in fiscal 2024."", ""Walmart already operates 10,500 global stores, including more than 4,600 in the U.S. alone, but it continues to expand. It's planning to open 230 stores this year, mostly international, and to convert some U.S. stores to larger locations that can support and generate higher sales. It's also finding new ways to generate growth, such as its acquisition of streaming platform Vizio to expand its advertising business and compete with Amazon."", ""Chipotle similarly is demonstrating solid performance. Despite the challenging environment, it reported a 14.3% year-over-year revenue increase in 2023, with comparable sales up 7.9%. That's a solid mix of growth coming from existing stores as well as a strong contribution from new stores. Its operating margin increased from 13.4% to 15.8%, and EPS rose 38.4% to $44.34."", ""Chipotle operates more than 3,400 stores as of the beginning of the year, but management sees the opportunity for 7,000 stores in the U.S. alone, all company-operated. It recently inked its first deal for a franchise agreement in the Middle East, and it's expanding into other international markets."", ""Chipotle stock is much more expensive than Walmart, trading at double Walmart's price-to-earnings ratio."", ""However, investors might justify that because Chipotle stock has tripled Walmart's gain over the past five years, dividends included. Walmart pays a dividend that yields 1.28% at the current price. That's below the\xa0S&P 500 average, but it's growing and reliable."", ""So which stock split stock is the better buy? I would go with Chipotle. I find it very compelling as a stock that offers growth but doesn't come with a lot of risk; it has proven itself over time and has plenty of remaining growth opportunities. These kinds of stocks are more expensive because they present so much value."", 'Still, investors looking for passive income and even greater stability might prefer Walmart stock.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

Walmart alleged Capital One repeatedly failed to meet several contractual obligations of the card partnership, including promptly issuing replacement cards to customers, and processing their payments and posting transactions to their accounts in a timely manner.', 'The terms of the 2018 credit card issuing agreement between the retailer and the lender laid out a number of customer service benchmarks Capital One was required to meet. The company also had to provide monthly reports on its performance related to those standards as part of the partnership agreement, which was to run through at least 2026, according to The Wall Street Journal.\xa0', 'A provision of the agreement between the two affords Walmart a unilateral right to end the partnership if Capital One “repeatedly fails to meet certain critical customer service benchmarks,” the ruling noted.\xa0', 'But the two parties disagreed over the interpretation of that right, and whether customer service issues occurring in the latter half of 2022 triggered Walmart’s right to end the partnership.\xa0', 'The retailer said its card-issuing partner failed to meet standards in five “critical” categories over a 12-month rolling period, according to the lawsuit. Capital One, however, said the termination right could only be invoked if the company fell short in the same category five or more times in that time period.\xa0\xa0', 'Failla determined “the plain meaning” of the agreement matches Walmart’s interpretation. “The Court declines to relieve Capital One of the consequences of its bargain here,” Failla wrote.', 'A Capital One spokesperson said Tuesday the company disagrees with the ruling “and we are evaluating our appeal rights.”\xa0', 'A Walmart spokesperson said the company is pleased with the court’s decision. “As we’ve said all along, the unambiguous terms of the agreement entitled Walmart to terminate the parties ongoing relationship,” the spokesperson said in a Wednesday email.', 'If the partnership ends, next year “appears to be the earliest period where there would be an impact” on Capital One, KBW\xa0analyst Sanjay Sakhrani wrote in a Tuesday note to investor clients. At the end of 2022, the Walmart portfolio had a loan balance of $8.3 billion — 6% of Capital One’s domestic card portfolio — and it produced $214 million in net income that year. Those figures have likely shrunk since then, he noted.\xa0', '“While not positive, we don’t view the ultimate impact as being material to [Capital One],” Sakhrani wrote. The earnings impact “would be manageable” and could be offset “through a combination of expense management and share buybacks using the freed-up capital/reserve,” he wrote.\xa0', 'Failla told Walmart and Capital One to submit a joint letter by April 19 that addresses the next steps and how they’ll resolve the case’s remaining claims and counterclaims.', '“It’s tough to do business with Walmart,” said Brian Riley, co-head of payments at Javelin Strategy & Research. In the retailer’s previous credit card partnership, with Synchrony Financial, Walmart questioned Synchrony’s underwriting strategy, he noted.\xa0', 'Walmart, which counts more than 1 million credit cardholders, has now worked with two of the top players in the co-branded cards market, Riley said.', '“I don’t think it will be a piece of cake to find a new partner, even though the volume’s attractive,” Riley said. “The stability of the relationship is really important.”\xa0', 'Riley said he wonders if Walmart will lean on its fintech\xa0unit One as the replacement vehicle for its credit card program.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased."", 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.', ' View our latest analysis for MetLife ', ""The Executive VP and Head of Global Technology & Operations, Bill Pappas, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$72.27 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$73.92, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 32% of Bill Pappas's stake. Bill Pappas was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months."", 'The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. MetLife insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$117m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.', ""An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company.

In the months ahead, the bridge collapse will likely cost a great deal more — not in lives but in time and money.', 'The Key Bridge is a major thoroughfare in a huge metropolitan area, part of the Baltimore Beltway that encircles the city. The bridge itself is part of Interstate 695, a spur of Interstate 95 that runs from Miami to Boston and farther points north — the most important road link on the Eastern Seaboard, and arguably the entire United States.

To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy industry, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.', 'Although renewable energy has been a trending topic for the last few years, the industry still has a long way to go. At the COP 28 conference in December 2023, it was recognized that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut down by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, if we are to keep global warming below 1.5°C.\xa0', 'While 2022 was the year of fossil fuels due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the industry didn’t perform well the next year. Oil and gas prices normalized during 2023, and the super majors’ profits took a tumble. The energy sector saw investments worth $2.8 trillion, and 60% of the investments were directed toward renewable energy in 2023. For the oil and gas sector analysis, you can go to 13 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside.', 'According to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the United States saw the deployment of $303.3 billion in financing for clean energy technologies as part of its transition toward sustainable energy in 2023. In the year, 42 gigawatts (GW) of additional renewable power generation capacity was added to the U.S. grid. Tax rebates and other incentives have been the driving force behind the rise in renewables. Since the announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, the number of planned renewable energy manufacturing facilities has risen to 104, compared to 9 in August 2022.', ""Despite record-breaking investments, the renewable energy industry did not perform well in 2023, and related stocks declined significantly compared to the broader market. The most in-demand segment in renewable energy was solar, yet Global X Solar ETF (RAYS) and Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) performed poorly, showing declines of over 35% and nearly 27% in 2023, respectively. On top of that, the security and protection company ADT Inc. (NYSE:ADT), which was also involved in the residential solar business, announced its exit from the industry in January due to facing challenges caused by worsening conditions in the sector influenced by broader economic factors. At the company's Q4, 2023 earnings call, ADT Inc.'s (NYSE:ADT) interim CFO and president of corporate development and chief transformation officer, Jeffrey Likosar said:"", '""The Solar segment generated $50 million of revenue and a $28 million adjusted EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter. For the year, Solar\'s adjusted EBITDA loss was $117 million on $330 million of revenue. We had previously written off all solar goodwill and impaired certain other assets in connection with our partial shutdown in 2023. As announced in January, and as Jim mentioned, we are now winding down operations altogether. As we refocused our business during the past year, we continued strong cash generation in CSB. Total company adjusted free cash flow, including interest rate swaps, was $525 million for the full year. This was down slightly versus 2022 driven by solar performance and higher net interest expense offsetting the CSB progress.""', 'High interest rates and labor wages leading to high costs have been the primary hurdles in the growth of the sector. However, on March 20, the Fed seemed to be firm on its decision of three rate cuts this year and kept the interest rates steady. Furthermore, compared to the fossil fuel industry, the renewables segment is still in its infancy and is expected to grow at a fast pace. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global renewable energy market was estimated at $1.02 trillion in 2023 and will reach $1.55 trillion by 2028. The industry is expected to register a nearly 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during the forecasted period.', 'Despite the growth prospects of the renewable energy industry, there are still some hurdles that it is facing. The latest one is ""Basel III: Endgame"", which was proposed in July 2023, as reported by Reuters. The Basel III framework was introduced in response to the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009, providing capital and liquidity standards for the global banking system. It requires banks to keep a certain amount of money on the side as a safety net when they invest in equities or projects to cover potential losses and maintain stability. Currently, investments like renewable energy and a few others are considered to carry a 100% risk unless they make up more than 10% of a bank’s capital, which means that the banks have to set aside one dollar for every dollar invested. If they exceed 10%, the risk weighting increases to 400%. The new regulations (Basel III: Endgame) proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) seek to remove this 10% threshold and aim to keep risk weighting to 400% for all investments. These proposed changes could negatively affect the investments made in the renewables industry.', 'Nevertheless, NorthStar Asset Management\'s CIO and senior portfolio manager, Nimrit Kang, is quite bullish on the renewable energy sector in the long term. In an interview with CNBC posted on March 6, she said that the market has performed well recently and is ""due for a pause"" in the near term, but looking forward 5 to 10 years, the market trajectory is still ""upward"". She further added that a lot of money could be made from the clean energy sector. One stock that Kang recommends is Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) due to its operations in electrical infrastructure and also its products being used in data centers amid the recent AI revolution.', ""At NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:NEE) Q4 2023 earnings call, Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research raised the question of the sustainability of the IRA in case election results are in favor of the Republicans. The CEO of the company, John Ketchum, replied that it was highly unlikely that the IRA would be affected negatively. He said:"", '“...in the 21 years I’ve been at the company, as we’ve changed administrations and we’ve seen changes in Congress, we’ve never seen a change or appeal of tax credits. No matter what form they’ve taken, IRA is the form we’re talking about here. So that’s the first point I would make. Second, it’s really hard to overturn existing law. I think Obamacare is a very good example of that. It’s just very difficult no matter what the political wins are. The third point I would make is that the IRA benefits both sides of the aisle. It certainly is advantageous for obvious reasons for Democrats, but it also has a big benefit to Republicans. Because if you think about where the investments are being made around IRA and where a lot of the benefit of IRA is flowing, it’s flowing to Republican states and it’s flowing to parts of those states that are really difficult to stimulate economically. And we’re talking about rural communities in these states. And so when we come in and we build a wind project, we build a solar project, we build a battery storage project, it’s a complete turnaround for these communities. We’re providing an economic base in the form of jobs. We’re providing an economic base in the form of spending that occurs in that community. We’re providing an economic base in the form of property taxes and sales tax revenues. These are 180s for these rural communities and make a huge difference on their viability going forward.”', 'In light of the above-mentioned data, some of the most undervalued renewable energy stocks according to analysts, include Ameresco, Inc.

(NYSE:NEE). Over the past few years, the company developed into a growth darling thanks to its strong track record in renewable energy development and tailwinds from the global energy transition and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act. The problem for NextEra, and the transition broadly, is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital. This requires high capital expenditures – often resulting in negative free cash flow – to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra. To help, the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners, providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans. NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically. Ultimately, the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions, driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog.

To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy industry, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.', 'Although renewable energy has been a trending topic for the last few years, the industry still has a long way to go. At the COP 28 conference in December 2023, it was recognized that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut down by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, if we are to keep global warming below 1.5°C.\xa0', 'While 2022 was the year of fossil fuels due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the industry didn’t perform well the next year. Oil and gas prices normalized during 2023, and the super majors’ profits took a tumble. The energy sector saw investments worth $2.8 trillion, and 60% of the investments were directed toward renewable energy in 2023. For the oil and gas sector analysis, you can go to 13 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside.', 'According to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the United States saw the deployment of $303.3 billion in financing for clean energy technologies as part of its transition toward sustainable energy in 2023. In the year, 42 gigawatts (GW) of additional renewable power generation capacity was added to the U.S. grid. Tax rebates and other incentives have been the driving force behind the rise in renewables. Since the announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, the number of planned renewable energy manufacturing facilities has risen to 104, compared to 9 in August 2022.', ""Despite record-breaking investments, the renewable energy industry did not perform well in 2023, and related stocks declined significantly compared to the broader market. The most in-demand segment in renewable energy was solar, yet Global X Solar ETF (RAYS) and Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) performed poorly, showing declines of over 35% and nearly 27% in 2023, respectively. On top of that, the security and protection company ADT Inc. (NYSE:ADT), which was also involved in the residential solar business, announced its exit from the industry in January due to facing challenges caused by worsening conditions in the sector influenced by broader economic factors. At the company's Q4, 2023 earnings call, ADT Inc.'s (NYSE:ADT) interim CFO and president of corporate development and chief transformation officer, Jeffrey Likosar said:"", '""The Solar segment generated $50 million of revenue and a $28 million adjusted EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter. For the year, Solar\'s adjusted EBITDA loss was $117 million on $330 million of revenue. We had previously written off all solar goodwill and impaired certain other assets in connection with our partial shutdown in 2023. As announced in January, and as Jim mentioned, we are now winding down operations altogether. As we refocused our business during the past year, we continued strong cash generation in CSB. Total company adjusted free cash flow, including interest rate swaps, was $525 million for the full year. This was down slightly versus 2022 driven by solar performance and higher net interest expense offsetting the CSB progress.""', 'High interest rates and labor wages leading to high costs have been the primary hurdles in the growth of the sector. However, on March 20, the Fed seemed to be firm on its decision of three rate cuts this year and kept the interest rates steady. Furthermore, compared to the fossil fuel industry, the renewables segment is still in its infancy and is expected to grow at a fast pace. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global renewable energy market was estimated at $1.02 trillion in 2023 and will reach $1.55 trillion by 2028. The industry is expected to register a nearly 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during the forecasted period.', 'Despite the growth prospects of the renewable energy industry, there are still some hurdles that it is facing. The latest one is ""Basel III: Endgame"", which was proposed in July 2023, as reported by Reuters. The Basel III framework was introduced in response to the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009, providing capital and liquidity standards for the global banking system. It requires banks to keep a certain amount of money on the side as a safety net when they invest in equities or projects to cover potential losses and maintain stability. Currently, investments like renewable energy and a few others are considered to carry a 100% risk unless they make up more than 10% of a bank’s capital, which means that the banks have to set aside one dollar for every dollar invested. If they exceed 10%, the risk weighting increases to 400%. The new regulations (Basel III: Endgame) proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) seek to remove this 10% threshold and aim to keep risk weighting to 400% for all investments. These proposed changes could negatively affect the investments made in the renewables industry.', 'Nevertheless, NorthStar Asset Management\'s CIO and senior portfolio manager, Nimrit Kang, is quite bullish on the renewable energy sector in the long term. In an interview with CNBC posted on March 6, she said that the market has performed well recently and is ""due for a pause"" in the near term, but looking forward 5 to 10 years, the market trajectory is still ""upward"". She further added that a lot of money could be made from the clean energy sector. One stock that Kang recommends is Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) due to its operations in electrical infrastructure and also its products being used in data centers amid the recent AI revolution.', ""At NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:NEE) Q4 2023 earnings call, Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research raised the question of the sustainability of the IRA in case election results are in favor of the Republicans. The CEO of the company, John Ketchum, replied that it was highly unlikely that the IRA would be affected negatively. He said:"", '“...in the 21 years I’ve been at the company, as we’ve changed administrations and we’ve seen changes in Congress, we’ve never seen a change or appeal of tax credits. No matter what form they’ve taken, IRA is the form we’re talking about here. So that’s the first point I would make. Second, it’s really hard to overturn existing law. I think Obamacare is a very good example of that. It’s just very difficult no matter what the political wins are. The third point I would make is that the IRA benefits both sides of the aisle. It certainly is advantageous for obvious reasons for Democrats, but it also has a big benefit to Republicans. Because if you think about where the investments are being made around IRA and where a lot of the benefit of IRA is flowing, it’s flowing to Republican states and it’s flowing to parts of those states that are really difficult to stimulate economically. And we’re talking about rural communities in these states. And so when we come in and we build a wind project, we build a solar project, we build a battery storage project, it’s a complete turnaround for these communities. We’re providing an economic base in the form of jobs. We’re providing an economic base in the form of spending that occurs in that community. We’re providing an economic base in the form of property taxes and sales tax revenues. These are 180s for these rural communities and make a huge difference on their viability going forward.”', 'In light of the above-mentioned data, some of the most undervalued renewable energy stocks according to analysts, include Ameresco, Inc.

Over the past few years, the company developed into a growth darling thanks to its strong track record in renewable energy development and tailwinds from the global energy transition and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act. The problem for NextEra, and the transition broadly, is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital. This requires high capital expenditures – often resulting in negative free cash flow – to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra. To help, the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners, providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans. NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically. Ultimately, the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions, driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog.

Although they don't offer the highest yields, these companies have been paying a ton in dividends. And in the long run, they could become great dividend growth stocks."", 'Tech giant Microsoft paid out the most in dividends last year, with a generous $20.7 billion paid out to its shareholders over its most recent four quarters. The company has routinely been on the list of the top dividend payers, and it has occupied one of the top three spots in each of the past four years.

Sales growth at Amazon Web Services slowed to a record low last year as business customers cut costs and delayed modernization projects. Now spending is starting to pick up again, and Amazon is keen to secure land and electricity for its power-hungry facilities.', '“We’re expanding capacity quite significantly,” said Kevin Miller, an AWS vice president who oversees the company’s data centers. “I think that just gives us the ability to get closer to customers.”', 'Over the past two years, according to a Bloomberg tally, Amazon has committed to spending $148 billion to build and operate data centers around the world. The company plans to expand existing server farm hubs in northern Virginia and Oregon as well as push into new precincts, including Mississippi, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.', 'Amazon’s planned outlay on server farms dwarfs the public commitments from Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, though neither company discloses data center-related spending as consistently as Amazon. Microsoft and Google spokespeople declined to provide comparable figures and added that each company likely includes different costs in their estimates.', 'Amid broader cost-cutting at Amazon, AWS’s capital expenditures on data centers shrank 2% in 2023—for the first time—even as Microsoft boosted its own spending by more than 50%, according to the research firm Dell’Oro Group. But Amazon’s chief financial officer said last month that capital expenditures would increase this year to support AWS growth, including AI-related projects.', 'Much of Amazon’s data center expansion is geared toward meeting a rise in demand for corporate services like file storage and databases. But the facilities, along with advanced and expensive chips, will also provide the massive computing power required for an expected boom in generative artificial intelligence.', 'Microsoft, close partner OpenAI and Google are widely seen as leaders in commercializing software capable of generating text and insights. But Amazon is building its own tools to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power AI services with its servers. As a result, Amazon expects to reap tens of billions of dollars in AI-related revenue.', 'AWS put its first server farms in Virginia, on the fringes of metropolitan Washington. Home to the first commercial interchange for web traffic, the area remains a crucial hub for video streaming and corporate and government data. Amazon later opened data centers in rural eastern Oregon, taking advantage of cheap hydroelectric power and ample tax breaks. Virginia and Oregon have since received about four of every five dollars AWS spends on US infrastructure.', 'Amazon plans to spend tens of billions more in those states, but it’s getting harder to secure electricity there. Data centers require lots of power, and their growing ubiquity is putting pressure on utilities. For a few months in 2022, Dominion Energy Inc., which powers Virginia’s data center alley, couldn’t keep up, pausing connections to facilities that were otherwise ready to come online. The utility expects demand to nearly double over the next 15 years, with the growth driven primarily by data centers.', 'In Oregon, electricity use by Amazon server farms exceeds the local utility’s share of hydroelectric power, forcing it to buy electricity generated by natural gas, the Oregonian newspaper reported earlier this year.', '“There’s a lot more vetting that is occurring upfront and detailed planning that is required from the utility companies to understand how real the project is because there’s so much demand out there that was not there five years ago,” said Ali Greenwood, an executive director at the data center practice of Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm.', 'So Amazon is getting creative.', 'In February, the company said it would spend about $10 billion on two data center campuses in Mississippi. Billed as the largest corporate project in state history, AWS’s effort will plant roots in the southern US, a region that has seen comparatively little data center spending outside of major cities like Dallas and Atlanta.', 'Earlier this month, the operator of a 40-year-old nuclear power plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania said AWS had agreed to spend $650 million to acquire a data center campus connected to the facility.', 'In Round Rock, Texas, AWS recently won zoning approval to build a data center and electrical substation next to a delivery depot on a slice of a former ranch the company acquired during a pandemic-era spending spree. If the project proceeds, it will be the first time the company has put such facilities on the same piece of land.', '“Right now it’s just a mad scramble for any place that has power any time soon,” said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft manager and Seattle-based investor who tracks cloud company spending.', 'Even as it ramps up, Amazon and other companies are encountering growing opposition to data centers. Much of the current animus is centered in Virginia, where residents complain about server farms’ incessant hum and preservationists lament the sprawling facilities’ encroachment on Civil War battlefield sites. But pockets of resistance are popping up in other parts of the US and could grow as more and more data centers come online—whether they are built by Amazon or not.', 'Renewable energy advocates also say the rush to build new facilities has given new life to old plants powered by planet-warming fossil fuels, and even helped make the case to build new ones. In Mississippi, for example, Amazon will pay to help the local utility to build solar farms, but the company will also operate the data centers with a new natural-gas power plant that will probably operate for decades.', '“Companies like Amazon are going to have to use their buying power to actually force the utilities to change their behavior,” said Daniel Tait, research and communications manager with the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog that backs renewables. “Not only are they inducing more fossil fuel use, but they are creating the precedent that everybody who comes after them will do the same.”', 'In recent years, Amazon has been the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, part of a pledge to power all of its operations with renewable electricity by 2025. But those projects can be far from its data centers, a mismatch between supply and demand that bedevils the fractured and aging US power grid.', 'Amazon data center chief Miller said the company was continuing to evaluate clean energy projects beyond wind and solar farms, including battery storage and nuclear power, that can substitute for fossil fuel plants. He pledged to work with utilities and find a way to “match our need for energy with renewable, carbon-free power.”', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Elon Musk’s X Has a Porn Problem', 'How Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future', 'EV Rise Helps BYD Overtake Geely to Become China’s Car King', 'Canada’s RBC Struggles to Go Green While Financing Oil', 'AI Energy Crisis Boosts Interest in Chips That Do It All', '©2024 Bloomberg L.P.']"

Named after mathematician, statistician, and pioneering game theorist David Blackwell, the new graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware is designed to deliver unprecedented processing power for generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications."", ""Made possible by a roughly $10 billion research and development budget, the first GB200 Blackwell processors are expected to deliver a major leap forward compared to the company's existing Hopper H100 GPUs. Nvidia expects to begin shipping the first generation of Blackwell chips later this year. A single GB200 GPU is expected to sell for somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000, and CEO Jensen Huang believes the new processor will quickly become the most successful product in the company's history."", ""What does the upcoming release of Blackwell mean for Nvidia's stock? And how will this incredibly powerful new GPU reshape the AI landscape?"", ""With a market capitalization of roughly $2.4 trillion, Nvidia now ranks as the third-most valuable of the Magnificent Seven companies. The AI leader's stock soared 259% over the last year as skyrocketing demand for its GPUs powered incredible sales and earnings growth. Now, the company has a new processor on the horizon that looks poised to deliver incredible tech breakthroughs."", ""Nvidia's GB200 is expected to be roughly four times as fast as its H100 GPUs, which are currently top of the line and favored for powering today's most advanced AI applications. Given the dramatic performance improvements delivered by the first generation of Blackwell chips, it's reasonable to expect that these new processors will pave the way for dramatic new advancements in AI technologies."", ""Nvidia already said that Blackwell is being adopted by every major global cloud-services provider. It's also seeing strong demand from AI-focused companies, telecom providers, and a range of other technology businesses. Heralding the arrival of what looks to be another breakthrough moment for artificial intelligence, Blackwell's unveiling was paired with endorsements from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and other high-profile tech leaders and luminaries."", ""But crucially, Blackwell is part of a much larger ecosystem strategy. Check out this quote from Nvidia's Jensen Huang:"", ""Blackwell is both a chip at the heart of the system, but it's really a platform. It's basically a computer system. What Nvidia does for a living is not build the chip. We build an entire supercomputer, from the chip to the system to the interconnects, the NVLinks, the networking, but very importantly the software."", ""Nvidia will also be using its next-generation GPUs to advance its position and ambitions in the software space. Leading AI developers already rely on Nvidia's CUDA software to create applications that are powered by the company's processors, and the appeal of the high-performance Blackwell processors should help ensure that customers continue to use its software."", 'The strategy extends even further. During a meeting at GTC, Huang had this to say: ""You can build chips to make software run better, but you can\'t create a new market without software.

The company is the undisputed leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and the best-performing ""Magnificent Seven"" stock since early last year. Furthermore, Nvidia generated triple-digit year-over-year growth for three successive quarters and is forecasting another one for the current quarter. I\'ve been bullish on Nvidia for a long time.', ""You're absolutely right on every one of those counts. And no, I haven't changed my mind. I'm still as bullish on Nvidia as ever. Here's the thing: The stock is selling for 80 times earnings and 39 times sales, and despite its growth trajectory, some investors won't even consider a stock with a valuation of that magnitude, even if the forward multiples of 38 times earnings and 18 times sales are more favorable."", 'For investors who have absolutely no intention of buying Nvidia at this level, I offer two alternatives from among the other six stocks in the Magnificent Seven: of Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla.', 'These stocks still have significant upside but with more reasonable valuations. Furthermore, while Wall Street loves Nvidia, they love Amazon and Microsoft even more.', ""It's easy to see why Wall Street has a soft spot for Amazon. The company revolutionized digital retail, turning a humble online bookstore into an e-commerce juggernaut. Amazon controlled roughly 38% of the e-commerce market last year, according to online data provider Statista. For context, that's more than the next 14 digital retailers combined. The improving economy will no doubt boost its fortunes over the coming year and beyond."", 'Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the undisputed leader in the cloud infrastructure space it pioneered, with 31% of the market, according to market analyst Canalys. In response to the accelerating demand for generative AI, Amazon beefed up its cloud offerings, providing the company with a compelling opportunity for future growth.', ""Let's not forget Amazon's digital advertising business. The company was already the third largest online advertiser, behind just Google and Meta Platforms -- and that was before Amazon added advertisements to its Prime Video that will surely boost its revenue."", 'Investors might be surprised to find that, of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Amazon is the hands-down favorite among Wall Street analysts, not Nvidia. Of the 47 analysts who cover Amazon, 91% rate the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommends selling. Only 55% rate Nvidia stock a buy, with the rest moving to hold or sell based on valuation concerns.', ""When it comes to Amazon, Mizuho analyst James Lee is the most bullish among his Wall Street colleagues. He has a buy rating and $230 price target on the stock, which suggests roughly 30% upside. The analyst cites improving revenue for AWS and operating efficiency gains for Amazon's e-commerce business as fueling his positive take."", ""Given the multiple drivers for future growth, it's easy to see why Amazon is a favorite among Wall Street analysts. Furthermore, at less than 3 times next year's sales, Amazon stock is a bargain."", ""It's not difficult to see the appeal of Microsoft. It's best known for its ubiquitous Windows operating system and its leading suite of business productivity software, Office, which provides the company with a strong foundation upon which to build its future."", ""Microsoft Azure is the No. 2 Cloud provider, with 26% of the market, and growth recently accelerated to 30% year over year in the most recent quarter, outpacing AWS and Google Cloud at 13% and 26%, respectively. Helping fuel those market share gains was the company's quick move into generative AI and its suite of AI-fueled digital assistants dubbed Copilot."", 'These moves increased demand for Azure. In its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended Dec. 31, the company noted that 6 percentage points of its cloud growth was the result of growing demand for AI services.', 'Microsoft is also more highly rated on Wall Street than Nvidia. Of the 34 analysts who offered opinions in March, 79% rate the stock a buy or strong buy, also well ahead of the GPU specialist.', ""Analysts at Truist are Microsoft's biggest cheerleaders on Wall Street. They have a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $600, which represents 42% upside for investors. The analysts cite Microsoft's early implementation of generative AI and see additional demand for Azure and Copilot as driving future growth."", ""Microsoft's early moves in AI and strong legacy businesses help illustrate why the stock is preferred on Wall Street. Furthermore, at less than 36 times forward earnings, Microsoft is selling at a slight premium to the multiple of 28 for the S&P 500.

Why? Because there are more than 2.2 billion of them in use worldwide. According to Statista, 96% of the global population uses a mobile device to access the internet, and smartphones account for about half the time we spend online.', ""Deals like the one with Apple help Google's maintain its dominant 91.6% market share in the search industry."", 'The same phenomenon will apply to AI. There are reports that Apple is also holding talks with OpenAI, and whichever AI provider the company selects to power its devices could instantly become the most widely deployed in the entire world.', ""Apple isn't new to AI. Its Siri voice assistant is powered by the technology, as is the recommendation engine in Apple Music. Its latest iPhone 15 Pro is also fitted with the A17 Pro chip, which was designed to efficiently handle AI workloads on-device instead of in the cloud."", ""Apple is building its own AI models in-house. However, its staunch approach to privacy means the company may not have the same amount of useful data as Google -- or perhaps isn't willing to use it -- to make those models competitive. That's speculation on my part, but outsourcing AI could be the more palatable option."", ""Details are light on the scope of the potential deal, but Gemini could help Apple users rapidly craft messages and emails, as well as quickly generate image and video content. Plus, chatbots are a more convenient way to find information compared to traditional search engines, so Gemini could reduce the time users spend browsing the internet. Since that basically cannibalizes Google Search, it's even more important for Alphabet to win this deal."", 'Apple needs Gemini to deliver advanced AI to users of the next-generation iPhone. Competing smartphones from Samsung (and even Google) are already miles ahead on that front. The Samsung Galaxy S24 introduced capabilities like Live Translate, which allows two people to converse in different languages over the phone, and Circle to Search, which recognizes image content to help users run search queries.', ""Apple was the largest company in the world, with a $3 trillion valuation up until January. But it's now worth just $2.6 trillion, with Microsoft riding its own AI efforts to a $3.2 trillion market cap."", ""Apple faces a few other issues like sluggish revenue growth, as well as a recent lawsuit from the Department of Justice that accuses the company of illegally monopolizing the market. The latter could challenge Apple's closed-ecosystem approach to the App Store and even the iOS operating system, but it will probably take years for the case to wrap up."", ""An AI deal with Google could be worth tens of billions of dollars if the two businesses' existing search partnership is any indication. That will add some growth to Apple's top line, but more importantly, it could make the company the largest distributor of AI in the world."", ""Google, on the other hand, needs Apple's vote of confidence to cement its leadership in AI after it fell behind in 2023. ChatGPT has over 180 million monthly users, but a deal with Apple would see Gemini eclipse that number by several orders of magnitude."", 'If the two companies do reach an agreement, investors might want to own a stake in both, because it will easily be the biggest AI deal this industry has seen so far.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

There's no doubt that the huge potential for higher revenue at that time will trickle down to larger dividend payments."", ""The final -- and perhaps more important -- reason to be optimistic about Starbucks' dividend increasing in the years ahead is because of the company's consistent profitability.

So, when we ran our eye over Starbucks' (NASDAQ:SBUX) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Starbucks ."", ""We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Starbucks. The company has consistently earned 29% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 36% in that time. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If Starbucks can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future."", ""In short, we'd argue Starbucks has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. In light of this, the stock has only gained 36% over the last five years for shareholders who have owned the stock in this period.

Even then, Dutch Bros wouldn't come close to Starbucks' presence."", ""Unsurprisingly, Dutch Bros' sales gains have been superb. Thanks to a rapidly expanding store count, revenue increased at a compound annual rate of 43% in the last three years. Wall Street consensus estimates call for sales to rise at an annualized pace of 22% over the next three years."", ""But despite its massive scale, Starbucks was able to post better same-store sales growth than Dutch Bros in the latest fiscal year. That's not a positive trend for the latter."", ""It's also worth mentioning that over the long term, Starbucks plans to open more than 3,000 net new stores just in the U.S. to reach 20,000 total.

Consumers have no switching costs, and they are faced with an unlimited number of choices when picking where to buy coffee.', ""At its small size, it's difficult to argue that Dutch Bros has any competitive strength, like a powerful brand or cost advantages, that works in its favor. It still has to develop these traits over time."", ""Starbucks, on the other hand, possesses one of the world's most widely recognized brands. This not only helps to keep the company relevant over the long term, but it allows Starbucks to flex its pricing power on consumers.

Nationally, prices at limited-service restaurants are up almost 30% from February 2020 levels, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And more fast-food price increases will hit lower-income households harder because they spend a larger share of their income on food and consume disproportionately more fast food.', 'A spokesperson for McDonald’s said the company was exploring several ways to counterbalance the increase in labor costs and has yet to decide how much it will raise the price of menu items at its corporate-owned stores. At franchise locations, which account for 95% of the brand\'s U.S. portfolio, McDonald’s provides “informed pricing recommendations"" but final pricing is at the discretion of franchisees, the spokesperson said.', 'Starbucks said it had elected to raise the pay floor for all levels of employees in California to retain workers and to combat wage compression — when there is little difference in pay between experienced workers and entry-level ones. It plans to offset the increased labor expenditure “through a variety of levers — including near-term pricing as well as other efficiencies,” a spokesperson said.', 'The economic effects of such a sharp and sudden pay hike are unclear. In general, raising the minimum wage helps large swaths of low-wage workers, bringing some out of poverty, but others will lose out as employers scale back through layoffs, shorter shifts, reduced hiring and other cost-saving measures.', '“Where they can automate, they will automate more,” Holzer said. “Maybe some franchises will move out of state.”', 'The COVID-19 pandemic has already spurred more fast-food operators to install self-service ordering kiosks, and the industry is looking at other ways to depend less on human labor, including the use of robots.', 'Proponents of the new law say fast-food corporations can afford to pay up. The industry has flourished since the pandemic began as customers sought cheap and quick meals, leading to billions in sales and record profits.', 'But the brands say they, too, have had to contend with high inflation for ingredients and supplies and have already raised wages for their workers without government prompting. Between 2019 and 2022, the average weekly wage for employees at limited-service restaurants jumped 26% to $501.', 'Franchise owners in particular are anxious about their ability to shoulder the extra costs; labor accounts for roughly a third of a typical fast-food operator’s expenses.', 'Shortly after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the pay increase legislation into law in September, hundreds of Pizza Hut franchises in California moved to lay off more than 1,100 delivery drivers, federal and state filings show.', 'The affected Pizza Huts are run by franchise operators and located from Orange to Stanislaus counties, according to the California Employment Development Department.

Along with the higher minimum, the new law established a Fast Food Council — composed of business and labor representatives — that has the authority to set future pay increases (at a maximum of 3.5% a year) and develop standards on working conditions and employee safety and training.', 'Employees at fast-food or limited-service restaurants nationwide work about 25 hours a week on average. Many face unpredictable hours with some called in on short notice or required to work split shifts — two separate periods in one day.', 'Angelica Hernandez, who works as a cook trainer at a McDonald’s in Monterey Park and was appointed to the Fast Food Council, called the $20 minimum wage “good progress.” But she worries that the restaurant will respond by slashing employee hours, which she said it has done in the past after increasing wages.', '“They’re utilizing one person to do the job of two, three or four people,” she said.', 'Earlier this year, workers formed the California Fast Food Workers Union, which is part of the Service Employees International Union, to bargain with the council. The union has said it plans to push for annual wage increases, predictable schedules and just-cause protections.', 'Workers can expect to maintain some leverage in future negotiations as growth slows. There is still tight competition for fast-food workers, though not as stiff as at the height of the Great Resignation in 2021-22, when many people quit their jobs and rethought their work and life priorities after COVID-19.', 'A guaranteed $20 an hour could lure people on the sidelines into the fast-food job market, including teenagers who once dominated the fast-food workforce, economists said.', 'Over the years, the average age of fast-food workers in the U.S. has been rising gradually as many teens have instead sought enrichment jobs to prepare for college. The median age for fast-food workers is now 22.1, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.', 'Zev Brown, a senior at Eagle Rock High School, has worked government jobs and on political campaigns since his sophomore year, earning $18 to $25 an hour.', 'Although he knows classmates who have jobs at Starbucks, McDonald’s and Burger King, he said most of his friends prefer to work for local mom-and-pop businesses or start their own money-making ventures.', '“People want to work in the neighborhood they call home and the neighborhood in which they go to school,” Brown said. “Side-hustle culture and entrepreneurial culture are really big.”', 'That said, $20 an hour makes a fast-food job “more enticing for a student,” said his friend, 17-year-old Sawyer Sariñana, who has been making money through photography work.', '“I would definitely consider it now — I think that’s a big jump and makes a big difference,” said Sariñana, also a senior at Eagle Rock High School.', ""Read more: It's been the year of the worker. West Hollywood employers are so over it"", 'Fast-food locations in grocery stores, airports, hotels, theme parks, sports venues and other businesses are exempt from the minimum-wage increase, as are employers that operate a bakery on the premises — a loophole that has raised questions about whether Panera Bread and others like it must comply.', 'At first, it might seem that restaurant employers not covered by the mandate now have an advantage: As the big fast-food chains lay off or hire fewer staff, that could expand the pool of available workers — who could be paid less than $20 an hour. But owners of independent fast-casual and full-service restaurants aren’t sure that will be the case, and anticipate having to raise wages to keep pace.', '“Every bump in the restaurant labor market raises the prices for everyone, period.

To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy industry, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.', 'Although renewable energy has been a trending topic for the last few years, the industry still has a long way to go. At the COP 28 conference in December 2023, it was recognized that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut down by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, if we are to keep global warming below 1.5°C.\xa0', 'While 2022 was the year of fossil fuels due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the industry didn’t perform well the next year. Oil and gas prices normalized during 2023, and the super majors’ profits took a tumble. The energy sector saw investments worth $2.8 trillion, and 60% of the investments were directed toward renewable energy in 2023. For the oil and gas sector analysis, you can go to 13 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside.', 'According to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the United States saw the deployment of $303.3 billion in financing for clean energy technologies as part of its transition toward sustainable energy in 2023. In the year, 42 gigawatts (GW) of additional renewable power generation capacity was added to the U.S. grid. Tax rebates and other incentives have been the driving force behind the rise in renewables. Since the announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, the number of planned renewable energy manufacturing facilities has risen to 104, compared to 9 in August 2022.', ""Despite record-breaking investments, the renewable energy industry did not perform well in 2023, and related stocks declined significantly compared to the broader market. The most in-demand segment in renewable energy was solar, yet Global X Solar ETF (RAYS) and Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) performed poorly, showing declines of over 35% and nearly 27% in 2023, respectively. On top of that, the security and protection company ADT Inc. (NYSE:ADT), which was also involved in the residential solar business, announced its exit from the industry in January due to facing challenges caused by worsening conditions in the sector influenced by broader economic factors. At the company's Q4, 2023 earnings call, ADT Inc.'s (NYSE:ADT) interim CFO and president of corporate development and chief transformation officer, Jeffrey Likosar said:"", '""The Solar segment generated $50 million of revenue and a $28 million adjusted EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter. For the year, Solar\'s adjusted EBITDA loss was $117 million on $330 million of revenue. We had previously written off all solar goodwill and impaired certain other assets in connection with our partial shutdown in 2023. As announced in January, and as Jim mentioned, we are now winding down operations altogether. As we refocused our business during the past year, we continued strong cash generation in CSB. Total company adjusted free cash flow, including interest rate swaps, was $525 million for the full year. This was down slightly versus 2022 driven by solar performance and higher net interest expense offsetting the CSB progress.""', 'High interest rates and labor wages leading to high costs have been the primary hurdles in the growth of the sector. However, on March 20, the Fed seemed to be firm on its decision of three rate cuts this year and kept the interest rates steady. Furthermore, compared to the fossil fuel industry, the renewables segment is still in its infancy and is expected to grow at a fast pace. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global renewable energy market was estimated at $1.02 trillion in 2023 and will reach $1.55 trillion by 2028. The industry is expected to register a nearly 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during the forecasted period.', 'Despite the growth prospects of the renewable energy industry, there are still some hurdles that it is facing. The latest one is ""Basel III: Endgame"", which was proposed in July 2023, as reported by Reuters. The Basel III framework was introduced in response to the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009, providing capital and liquidity standards for the global banking system. It requires banks to keep a certain amount of money on the side as a safety net when they invest in equities or projects to cover potential losses and maintain stability. Currently, investments like renewable energy and a few others are considered to carry a 100% risk unless they make up more than 10% of a bank’s capital, which means that the banks have to set aside one dollar for every dollar invested. If they exceed 10%, the risk weighting increases to 400%. The new regulations (Basel III: Endgame) proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) seek to remove this 10% threshold and aim to keep risk weighting to 400% for all investments. These proposed changes could negatively affect the investments made in the renewables industry.', 'Nevertheless, NorthStar Asset Management\'s CIO and senior portfolio manager, Nimrit Kang, is quite bullish on the renewable energy sector in the long term. In an interview with CNBC posted on March 6, she said that the market has performed well recently and is ""due for a pause"" in the near term, but looking forward 5 to 10 years, the market trajectory is still ""upward"". She further added that a lot of money could be made from the clean energy sector. One stock that Kang recommends is Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) due to its operations in electrical infrastructure and also its products being used in data centers amid the recent AI revolution.', ""At NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:NEE) Q4 2023 earnings call, Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research raised the question of the sustainability of the IRA in case election results are in favor of the Republicans. The CEO of the company, John Ketchum, replied that it was highly unlikely that the IRA would be affected negatively. He said:"", '“...in the 21 years I’ve been at the company, as we’ve changed administrations and we’ve seen changes in Congress, we’ve never seen a change or appeal of tax credits. No matter what form they’ve taken, IRA is the form we’re talking about here. So that’s the first point I would make. Second, it’s really hard to overturn existing law. I think Obamacare is a very good example of that. It’s just very difficult no matter what the political wins are. The third point I would make is that the IRA benefits both sides of the aisle. It certainly is advantageous for obvious reasons for Democrats, but it also has a big benefit to Republicans. Because if you think about where the investments are being made around IRA and where a lot of the benefit of IRA is flowing, it’s flowing to Republican states and it’s flowing to parts of those states that are really difficult to stimulate economically. And we’re talking about rural communities in these states. And so when we come in and we build a wind project, we build a solar project, we build a battery storage project, it’s a complete turnaround for these communities. We’re providing an economic base in the form of jobs. We’re providing an economic base in the form of spending that occurs in that community. We’re providing an economic base in the form of property taxes and sales tax revenues. These are 180s for these rural communities and make a huge difference on their viability going forward.”', 'In light of the above-mentioned data, some of the most undervalued renewable energy stocks according to analysts, include Ameresco, Inc.

(NYSE:NEE). Over the past few years, the company developed into a growth darling thanks to its strong track record in renewable energy development and tailwinds from the global energy transition and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act. The problem for NextEra, and the transition broadly, is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital. This requires high capital expenditures – often resulting in negative free cash flow – to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra. To help, the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners, providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans. NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically. Ultimately, the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions, driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog.

These blue-chip companies have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years, making them some of the most reliable income generators on the market. Their share prices may fluctuate, especially during broader market downturns. However, their rising dividend payouts help hedge against rising prices over the long run.', 'That’s why Dividend Aristocrats can be ideal holdings for retirees or those nearing retirement who prioritize passive income. Rather than chasing risky growth stocks, parking your money in these stalwarts can provide steady compounding and mitigate some volatility. Their dividends also typically outpace inflation, protecting your purchasing power. Of course, no investment is risk-free – even these Dividend Aristocrats could stumble in an unlikely crisis. However, each of these companies boast a strong track record, with the ability to historically bounce back from bear markets.', 'So, I’d argue the greater danger is in not holding enough of these in your portfolio!

However, in my view, this decline merely represents a good buying opportunity. This pharmaceutical and retail giant is the beneficiary of major long-term tailwinds, and is simply too big to fail. The stock has now declined 11% below even its Great Recession trough, which seems like an overreaction by Mr. Market. I believe WBA stock will likely rebound higher very soon.', 'Of course, some may question my bullishness on WBA given its 66% five-year decline, which is not typical of a steady Dividend Aristocrat stock. And that’s a fair critique – Walgreens is not your traditional Dividend Aristocrat. But with so little downside left, I see significant upside potential once the current headwinds clear. Combine that with its juicy 4.7% dividend yield, and WBA stock starts looking quite attractive here.', 'Yes, management has made some missteps in the past. However, Walgreens is turning the corner operationally, with sales continuing to grow steadily. Analysts also expect the company’s earnings per share to stop declining in short order, with double digit earnings growth expected going forward, alongside mid-single-digit revenue expansion. I do not foresee WBA stock trading at just 6-times forward earnings and 0.13-times forward sales if this scenario plays out.', 'The elephant in the room is the company’s hefty $35 billion debt load.

Rowe Price has become collateral damage druing the broader financial sector downturn.', 'However, with the stock market bouncing back and rate cuts likely ahead, I see TROW stock challenging its $215 peak again in the coming years as its business recovers. In my view, this stock is bottoming now, presenting an ideal long-term buying opportunity. The company’s generous 4.2% dividend yield adds to the appeal.

That's an astounding figure that would've turned a $1,000 initial cash outlay into nearly $44 million today."", ""There's no denying that to build an outstanding track record like that over many decades (which has transformed Berkshire into a gargantuan $900 billion conglomerate), Buffett has proven he's one of the most skilled business analysts ever. However, I think there's another critical factor that has propelled his returns, and using it can supercharge your portfolio, as well."", ""A smart way to invest is with a long-term mindset. Most readers have decades before they approach retirement. But even if you're 10 years away, that's still a long enough time horizon to make focusing intensely on headlines and the minute details of analyst estimates a distraction."", 'Thinking long term is becoming more of a rarity these days. The introduction of Robinhood more than a decade ago started a race to zero when it came to trading fees, which made it free and effortless to trade.', ""Add this to the constant flow of news, and it makes sense why the average holding period of a stock these days can be measured in months. That's in stark contrast to the average holding period of over eight years in the 1950s. The average investor is not only encouraged by the news cycle and advertising to constantly be tinkering with their portfolios, but they have the tool (the smartphone in their pocket) to do so quickly."", ""This is where Buffett's approach stands out from the crowd. While it might be exciting and fun to try and predict short-term price movements, it's usually a losing proposition. Almost anything can happen in the short term. Consequently, investors who have multiyear outlooks have a sizable and growing advantage because stocks tend to rise over long periods. It's that simple."", ""Being a successful investor requires having the right skill set and temperament, like how to properly analyze financial statements, having the conviction to place a bet when the risk-reward is attractive, and reducing emotional influences. But it also means picking the spots where there's less attention being placed, and that's with a time horizon of multiple years out."", ""Now that we've established that focusing on the long term is wise, the next question centers on how to identify what makes a winning stock. When you think about the next five years, as opposed to the next five months, it forces you to focus on the most important factors that drive business results. "", ""I'm talking about things like the presence of an economic moat, solid growth potential, improving margins, and a reasonable valuation. These are favorable ingredients that should result in an investment working out well."", ""Netflix is the perfect example of a stock that was left for dead due to the dominance of a short-term perspective that took over investor sentiment at the time. The company lost a total of 1.2 million members in the first six months of 2022, following a surge in demand during the depths of the pandemic. Investors worried that intensifying competition spelled the beginning of the end of Netflix's run atop the streaming landscape."", 'Investors bid the shares down to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15 in the summer of 2022.

Disney's stock is being propelled by the successful implementation of the company's turnaround plan, robust free cash flow generation, and strategic partnerships within sports streaming. Meanwhile, Netflix's stock is thriving due to subscriber growth, increased revenue streams, and the recently announced collaboration with WWE to explore gaming opportunities."", ""Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal breaks down the details."", 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", ""SEANA SMITH: Two stocks that we were watching here this morning and that's Disney and Netflix. Both of those names hitting fresh 52-week highs this week. Now we have seen two though very different narratives play out at these two companies so far this year."", ""So we want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal, here to explain some of that action. And Allie, let's start with what you're seeing from Disney."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. So Disney-- a very interesting story considering last year we were at multi-year record lows, but we're hitting that 52-week high, shares trading just above 120 bucks a share."", ""Year to date, they're up 34%. If we take a look at a year chart, they're up 27% I would say. And you're seeing those multi-year record lows happening around the fall of last year. And there's a full reason why-- a few reasons why analysts and investors are pretty bullish on the stock at large."", ""So let's tick through some of those reasons. Number one being the fact that the turnaround plan that we're seeing from Bob Iger, it's beginning to take shape. We've seen the purchase of Hulu, which a lot of analysts on Wall Street think is going to be really lucrative when we think about subscriber acquisition."", ""Hulu has a lot of really great programming. That if you pair that with Disney Plus, it's a really attractive offering for consumers. We've also seen Bob Iger really double down on the fact that they want to produce quality content over quantity."", ""They've already scrapped some projects there. And they also are committing to different initiatives like the password sharing crackdown. Bloomberg Intelligence was out with a report that the password sharing crackdown could add $2 billion in revenue for the company."", ""So that's certainly a positive moving forward. And that's all contributing to really strong guidance when we think about earnings and free cash flow. That is important because it really is about profitability at the end of the day."", 'Barclays recently upgrading Disney and they said that they expect Disney Plus and the company streaming services to be profitable before the target date. Disney says that by the end of 2024, Disney Plus will be profitable. Barclays thinks that could be sooner.', ""And then finally, we have a lot of really great partnerships coming up with Disney, especially as it relates to sports, as it relates to gaming. We know, Disney has been doubling down on its sports initiatives. It's going to launch its ESPN fully over-the-top service next fall-- so 2025."", ""They are still searching for a partner there. But that could be an interesting move depending on who they go with. Perhaps if they partner with an Amazon, that could be something to watch. And then they also have that partnership with Warner Brothers Discovery and Fox coming out later this fall. That's the skinny sports bundle there."", ""And so, we're seeing when it comes to what Wall Street is saying, 28 buys, seven holds, two sells. Of course, we're one week out from that heated proxy battle with Nelson Peltz, a shareholder meeting in a week from today. That's going to really determine where that stands."", 'So we could see some volatility leading up to that, but it seems like Disney is in a pretty strong position at the moment going into that meeting.', ""- And Ali, another stock I know you're watching this morning is Netflix. We have news about a price target change Wedbush removing the stock from their best ideas list. What's going on with Netflix today?"", ""Yeah. So Netflix also hitting 52-week highs. If we take a look at the year-to-date performance, we're seeing the stock up also about 27%. I want to take a look at a two-year chart. Because post-COVID, Netflix really struggled."", ""They added a bunch of subscribers during that stay-at-home trade. But as the COVID trade sort of waned, we saw that really hit the stock price. But they have certainly climbed back. And I do think that the concern here from Wedbush is that a lot of these initiatives are already priced into the stocks, but there's still a lot more room to run here."", ""So let's tick through some potential upside reasons why Netflix is doing so well. One is healthy subscriber growth. We've seen them continuously add subscribers over the past few quarters. Now a lot of this has to do with the password sharing crackdown, which I'll get into in a minute."", ""But also, the fact that they've just been producing really solid content. Not just at home, but also overseas. They've been really committing to international investments, doubling down on their localization strategy and that's helping them with emerging markets."", ""I mentioned the password sharing crackdown. That I think is the issue where some analysts are saying that's largely priced in at this point. But we have another revenue driver and that is the advertising tier."", ""And by 2025-2026, we're going to see Netflix see some really significant growth in the ad tier that's going to add to revenue and then when you think about their partnerships, they have the WWE live partnership."", ""They're really expanding into live programming. They are doing more investments when we think about gaming. So the future is bright for a company like Netflix. They are targeting margins above 20%."", ""They certainly have a lot of optimism on the street with 40 buys, 16 holds, and just three sells. So another company that we're watching very closely and we'll have to see where things go. They report earnings in mid-April. So we'll get yet another update very soon."", '- And another season of busy earnings for you to cover, Ali. Thank you so much. Really appreciate your reporting as always.']"

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Phillips 66's  ROE."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Phillips 66 is:', '23% = US$7.2b ÷ US$32b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.23."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""Firstly, we acknowledge that Phillips 66 has a significantly high ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 21%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. Given the circumstances, the significant 30% net income growth seen by Phillips 66 over the last five years is not surprising."", ""Next, on comparing Phillips 66's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 36% over the last few years."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

Both firms see the retailers run by off-price conglomerate TJX, particularly its T.J. Maxx banner, as benefiting the most. Competitors as well as other Macy’s stores could grab billions in sales from the closures, according to Jeffries analysts led by Corey Tarlowe.', ""“Given TJX's significant customer and real estate overlap with Macy's, we believe that, over the next 3 years, there will be a few billions of dollars of share gain opportunity,” Tarlowe said in a Wednesday client note."", 'Some of this has to do with proximity: 63% of Macy’s stores, or nearly 500 locations,\xa0operate within a mile of a T.J.

Put another way,\xa0more than 1,000 T.J. Maxx or Marshalls stores sit within five miles of a Macy’s store. Just 12 Macy’s stores do not compete wither either of those retailers within a five-mile radius, according to that research.', 'The Washington, D.C. area has the most (a 700% overlap), followed by New York (312%) and Massachusetts (306%), Jeffries found. In the U.S., TJX also runs HomeGoods and Sierra.', 'Moreover, the Jeffries team found commonalities between TJX and Macy’s customer bases.

Nordstrom got the next largest share at 21%, while Macy’s itself garnered 15%.', 'Macy’s closure plans could fuel what has already been a steady loss of market share to off-price retail. TJX in particular grew its share in apparel and footwear from 12% in 2018 to 16.1% in 2023, with gains each year. Among department stores, Macy’s did build share from 2018 through 2023, but peaked in 2021 at 25.9% and then declined to 25.1% by 2023, according to Jeffries analysts.', 'Last year, T.D.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', 'As you can see below, at the end of December 2023, NextEra Energy had US$73.2b of debt, up from US$65.0b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$2.69b, its net debt is less, at about US$70.5b.', 'According to the last reported balance sheet, NextEra Energy had liabilities of US$28.0b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$90.5b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$2.69b and US$6.61b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$109.2b.', ""This deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of US$130.9b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on NextEra Energy's use of debt. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", ""NextEra Energy has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.3 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 3.0 times. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. However, it should be some comfort for shareholders to recall that NextEra Energy actually grew its EBIT by a hefty 160%, over the last 12 months. If it can keep walking that path it will be in a position to shed its debt with relative ease. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NextEra Energy's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", 'Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, NextEra Energy burned a lot of cash. While that may be a result of expenditure for growth, it does make the debt far more risky.', ""We'd go so far as to say NextEra Energy's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow was disappointing. But on the bright side, its EBIT growth rate is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. We should also note that Electric Utilities industry companies like NextEra Energy commonly do use debt without problems. Looking at the balance sheet and taking into account all these factors, we do believe that debt is making NextEra Energy stock a bit risky. Some people like that sort of risk, but we're mindful of the potential pitfalls, so we'd probably prefer it carry less debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for NextEra Energy   (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about."", ""When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

Over the last 50 years, the average dividend stock in the S&P 500 has produced a 9.2% average annual total return, outperforming the 7.7% average annual total return of an equal-weighted S&P 500 index. The best returns have come from dividend growers and initiators at 10.2%. ', 'NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) stand out for their ability to increase their dividends. That makes them great stocks to buy and hold for those seeking a potential lifetime of steadily rising income.', 'NextEra Energy has raised its dividend for 30 consecutive years. The utility has grown its payout at an 11% compound annual rate over the past decade, which is well above average. That has helped give it the power to produce a 13.1% average annual return over the last 10 years. It should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its payout, which currently yields an attractive 3.3%. At that rate, it could turn a $1,000 investment into a $33 and growing annual income stream. ', 'The utility updated its dividend policy early this year, extending its growth outlook further. It now expects to deliver above-average dividend growth of roughly 10% annually through at least 2026. ', 'Two factors power that plan. It had a low dividend payout ratio of 59% at the end of 2023, well below its peer average of about 65%. The other driver is its strong earnings growth profile. NextEra Energy expects to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 6% to 8% annually through 2026, with operating cash flow growing at or above that range. ', ""Meanwhile, the company's longer-term growth prospects are just as bright. Forecasters expect U.S. renewable energy demand to grow at a 13% compound annual rate through the end of the decade. That drives the view that the country will build more renewable energy capacity over the next six years (375-450 gigawatts) than it built over the last 30 years (235 GW). That would still only be a fraction of the capacity the country needs to decarbonize the economy by 2050. As the leader in renewables, NextEra Energy is in an excellent position to capitalize on this opportunity. That should give it plenty of power to continue increasing its dividend, which could help fuel robust total returns. "", 'Brookfield Infrastructure has also put together a strong record of growing its dividend. The global infrastructure operator delivered its 15th straight year of increasing its payout earlier this year. It has grown the dividend at a 10% compound annual rate since its formation in 2009. That has helped fuel a total return of 11.7% over the last decade. ', ""The company aims to increase its already high-yielding dividend of 4.7% at a 5% to 9% annual rate over the long term. Driving that view is its stable cash flow, a conservative payout ratio, and strong growth drivers. Some 90% of its funds from operations (FFO) are regulated or contracted, and it's paying out only 60% to 70% of its FFO. "", ""Brookfield Infrastructure has been focusing its portfolio to capitalize on three long-term global megatrends: deglobalization, digitalization, and decarbonization. The company closed over $2 billion of new investments last year in its transport (deglobalization) and data (digitalization) segments, which should drive robust growth in 2024 and beyond. It's also investing heavily in organic expansion projects across those three trends. Notable investments include a semiconductor manufacturing complex in the U.S. and several data center development projects around the world. "", 'The company believes that acquisitions, expansion projects, and other organic growth drivers will fuel 10%-plus FFO per share growth over the long term. Given its focus on trends with long runways, Brookfield should be able to continue increasing its dividend for decades to come.

Since the announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, the number of planned renewable energy manufacturing facilities has risen to 104, compared to 9 in August 2022.', ""Despite record-breaking investments, the renewable energy industry did not perform well in 2023, and related stocks declined significantly compared to the broader market. The most in-demand segment in renewable energy was solar, yet Global X Solar ETF (RAYS) and Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) performed poorly, showing declines of over 35% and nearly 27% in 2023, respectively. On top of that, the security and protection company ADT Inc. (NYSE:ADT), which was also involved in the residential solar business, announced its exit from the industry in January due to facing challenges caused by worsening conditions in the sector influenced by broader economic factors. At the company's Q4, 2023 earnings call, ADT Inc.'s (NYSE:ADT) interim CFO and president of corporate development and chief transformation officer, Jeffrey Likosar said:"", '""The Solar segment generated $50 million of revenue and a $28 million adjusted EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter. For the year, Solar\'s adjusted EBITDA loss was $117 million on $330 million of revenue. We had previously written off all solar goodwill and impaired certain other assets in connection with our partial shutdown in 2023. As announced in January, and as Jim mentioned, we are now winding down operations altogether. As we refocused our business during the past year, we continued strong cash generation in CSB. Total company adjusted free cash flow, including interest rate swaps, was $525 million for the full year. This was down slightly versus 2022 driven by solar performance and higher net interest expense offsetting the CSB progress.""', 'High interest rates and labor wages leading to high costs have been the primary hurdles in the growth of the sector. However, on March 20, the Fed seemed to be firm on its decision of three rate cuts this year and kept the interest rates steady. Furthermore, compared to the fossil fuel industry, the renewables segment is still in its infancy and is expected to grow at a fast pace. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global renewable energy market was estimated at $1.02 trillion in 2023 and will reach $1.55 trillion by 2028. The industry is expected to register a nearly 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during the forecasted period.', 'Despite the growth prospects of the renewable energy industry, there are still some hurdles that it is facing. The latest one is ""Basel III: Endgame"", which was proposed in July 2023, as reported by Reuters. The Basel III framework was introduced in response to the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009, providing capital and liquidity standards for the global banking system. It requires banks to keep a certain amount of money on the side as a safety net when they invest in equities or projects to cover potential losses and maintain stability. Currently, investments like renewable energy and a few others are considered to carry a 100% risk unless they make up more than 10% of a bank’s capital, which means that the banks have to set aside one dollar for every dollar invested. If they exceed 10%, the risk weighting increases to 400%. The new regulations (Basel III: Endgame) proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) seek to remove this 10% threshold and aim to keep risk weighting to 400% for all investments. These proposed changes could negatively affect the investments made in the renewables industry.', 'Nevertheless, NorthStar Asset Management\'s CIO and senior portfolio manager, Nimrit Kang, is quite bullish on the renewable energy sector in the long term. In an interview with CNBC posted on March 6, she said that the market has performed well recently and is ""due for a pause"" in the near term, but looking forward 5 to 10 years, the market trajectory is still ""upward"". She further added that a lot of money could be made from the clean energy sector. One stock that Kang recommends is Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) due to its operations in electrical infrastructure and also its products being used in data centers amid the recent AI revolution.', ""At NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:NEE) Q4 2023 earnings call, Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research raised the question of the sustainability of the IRA in case election results are in favor of the Republicans. The CEO of the company, John Ketchum, replied that it was highly unlikely that the IRA would be affected negatively. He said:"", '“...in the 21 years I’ve been at the company, as we’ve changed administrations and we’ve seen changes in Congress, we’ve never seen a change or appeal of tax credits. No matter what form they’ve taken, IRA is the form we’re talking about here. So that’s the first point I would make. Second, it’s really hard to overturn existing law. I think Obamacare is a very good example of that. It’s just very difficult no matter what the political wins are. The third point I would make is that the IRA benefits both sides of the aisle. It certainly is advantageous for obvious reasons for Democrats, but it also has a big benefit to Republicans. Because if you think about where the investments are being made around IRA and where a lot of the benefit of IRA is flowing, it’s flowing to Republican states and it’s flowing to parts of those states that are really difficult to stimulate economically. And we’re talking about rural communities in these states. And so when we come in and we build a wind project, we build a solar project, we build a battery storage project, it’s a complete turnaround for these communities. We’re providing an economic base in the form of jobs. We’re providing an economic base in the form of spending that occurs in that community. We’re providing an economic base in the form of property taxes and sales tax revenues. These are 180s for these rural communities and make a huge difference on their viability going forward.”', 'In light of the above-mentioned data, some of the most undervalued renewable energy stocks according to analysts, include Ameresco, Inc.

This requires high capital expenditures – often resulting in negative free cash flow – to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra.

NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically.

The S&P 500 is up 45% since the bear market ended in late 2022, and it is higher to the tune of 27% just since October 2023's low."", ""Many investors were too nervous to dive in during this stretch, fearing renewed economic weakness was just around the corner. If you were one of these people, don't beat yourself up. There's still plenty of upside left to plug into. You'll just want to make sure you don't repeat the mistake by missing out on any more of the market's gains. Exchange-traded funds (or ETFs) make this much easier to do by sidestepping the need for stock picking."", ""Here are three ETFs you may want to consider buying and then just sitting on for several decades. They make it easy to capitalize on all of the market's long-term potential without any further action needed on your part."", ""Technology stocks have a bit of a reputation for being volatile. And that reputation is well deserved; these are historically the market's most volatile stocks. They're so volatile, in fact, that at times they can be uncomfortable to stick with. Many investors also feel like they have to check in on these tickers every day. That gets old pretty quickly."", ""Still, they're arguably worth the trouble. The technology sector's stocks have outperformed the broad market for the better part of the past three decades."", ""This makes sense, of course. After all, these underlying companies are also the ones that introduced the world's most impactful advancements during this period."", 'The thing is, tech companies are most likely to unveil the most game-changing developments over the next three decades as well. Rather than trying to figure out which companies are going to lead the charge, why not just own a basket of all the major technology stocks with a position in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLK)?', ""The fund is designed to mirror the performance of State Street Global Advisors' Technology Select Sector Index, a basket of about 65 tech stocks within the S&P 500 index. Its top holdings right now are Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. But if and when these market (and market cap) leaders are outperformed by smaller or younger names in the future, the fund's regular rebalancing will reduce its exposure to these more familiar companies and add more exposure to the up-and-comers."", ""In other words, you don't have to guess which stocks need to be bought or sold -- State Street will take care of that for you."", ""For some investors the idea of owning dividend-paying stocks instead of growth stocks is boring. That line of thinking, however, misses a key point of being an investor in the first place. That is, your goal isn't to be entertained -- it's to make money! And dividend stocks can help you do this far more than you might suspect."", ""Mutual fund company Hartford crunched the numbers. Between 1940 and 2023, 34% of the S&P 500's total net return is attributable to dividends. The real workhorse, however, is reinvesting any dividend payments you may receive as time marches forward. Hartford adds that reinvesting dividends paid out during this stretch into more shares of the S&P 500 would improve a capital-appreciation-only gain of just under 8,000% to a net gain of more than 50,000%."", ""Here's the kicker: In the long run the market's very best dividend-paying stocks outperform the average non-dividend payer anyway. Hartford adds that between 1973 and 2022, shares of companies that reliably paid and raised their dividends gained an annualized average of right around 10%. For non-dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks, the average annual gain during this time is just under 4%. These solid dividend stocks were also less volatile, allowing their owners to sleep better at night."", 'Given all of this, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEMKT: VIG) seems like a no-brainer holding for most people, including those who ultimately want growth rather than income. Just as the name suggests, the fund is based on the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, which holds stocks that have raised their annualized payouts for at least the past 10 consecutive years.', ""Last but not least, if you've missed out on the bull market recovery thus far, the smart-money move to avoid missing any more of it is stepping into a stake in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY)."", ""Yes, this is the most simplistic and passive way of investing. It's not an attempt to beat the market -- it's just a means of matching the broad market's performance, for better or worse."", 'This may still actually be your best bet for a sizable portion of your portfolio, however.', ""See, beating the market by picking individual stocks is tough to do. It's so tough to do, in fact, that not even most professionals can do it for very long. Standard & Poor's reports that nearly 60% of large-cap mutual funds available to investors in the United States actually lagged the S&P 500 index in 2023. For the past five years, nearly 79% of these fund managers didn't beat the market. Over the course of the past 10 years, more than 87% of large-cap mutual funds underperformed the S&P 500."", ""If these well-trained and well-equipped professionals can't do it, how tough is it for an ordinary individual investor such as yourself to do so?"", ""That's not to suggest you should never own any individual stocks. See, you have a couple of advantages on most mutual fund managers. The first of these is, you don't have a boss standing over your shoulder expecting strong results each and every quarter; you can afford to be patient with your picks. And second, your trades aren't so big that buying and selling stocks can move that stock's price. Mutual funds' trades can do that."", 'Nevertheless, for most investors, the best foundational holding in any growth-seeking portfolio is a position in an index fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust right now?', 'Before you buy stock in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust wasn’t one of them.

Walmart alleged Capital One repeatedly failed to meet several contractual obligations of the card partnership, including promptly issuing replacement cards to customers, and processing their payments and posting transactions to their accounts in a timely manner.', 'The terms of the 2018 credit card issuing agreement between the retailer and the lender laid out a number of customer service benchmarks Capital One was required to meet. The company also had to provide monthly reports on its performance related to those standards as part of the partnership agreement, which was to run through at least 2026, according to The Wall Street Journal.\xa0', 'A provision of the agreement between the two affords Walmart a unilateral right to end the partnership if Capital One “repeatedly fails to meet certain critical customer service benchmarks,” the ruling noted.\xa0', 'But the two parties disagreed over the interpretation of that right, and whether customer service issues occurring in the latter half of 2022 triggered Walmart’s right to end the partnership.\xa0', 'The retailer said its card-issuing partner failed to meet standards in five “critical” categories over a 12-month rolling period, according to the lawsuit. Capital One, however, said the termination right could only be invoked if the company fell short in the same category five or more times in that time period.\xa0\xa0', 'Failla determined “the plain meaning” of the agreement matches Walmart’s interpretation. “The Court declines to relieve Capital One of the consequences of its bargain here,” Failla wrote.', 'A Capital One spokesperson said Tuesday the company disagrees with the ruling “and we are evaluating our appeal rights.”\xa0', 'A Walmart spokesperson said the company is pleased with the court’s decision. “As we’ve said all along, the unambiguous terms of the agreement entitled Walmart to terminate the parties ongoing relationship,” the spokesperson said in a Wednesday email.', 'If the partnership ends, next year “appears to be the earliest period where there would be an impact” on Capital One, KBW\xa0analyst Sanjay Sakhrani wrote in a Tuesday note to investor clients. At the end of 2022, the Walmart portfolio had a loan balance of $8.3 billion — 6% of Capital One’s domestic card portfolio — and it produced $214 million in net income that year. Those figures have likely shrunk since then, he noted.\xa0', '“While not positive, we don’t view the ultimate impact as being material to [Capital One],” Sakhrani wrote. The earnings impact “would be manageable” and could be offset “through a combination of expense management and share buybacks using the freed-up capital/reserve,” he wrote.\xa0', 'Failla told Walmart and Capital One to submit a joint letter by April 19 that addresses the next steps and how they’ll resolve the case’s remaining claims and counterclaims.', '“It’s tough to do business with Walmart,” said Brian Riley, co-head of payments at Javelin Strategy & Research. In the retailer’s previous credit card partnership, with Synchrony Financial, Walmart questioned Synchrony’s underwriting strategy, he noted.\xa0', 'Walmart, which counts more than 1 million credit cardholders, has now worked with two of the top players in the co-branded cards market, Riley said.', '“I don’t think it will be a piece of cake to find a new partner, even though the volume’s attractive,” Riley said. “The stability of the relationship is really important.”\xa0', 'Riley said he wonders if Walmart will lean on its fintech\xa0unit One as the replacement vehicle for its credit card program. ', '“But it’s a classic case of, be careful what you ask for,” he said.

The company's CUDA software platform, which enables developers to write applications that tap into Nvidia's GPUs for accelerating workloads, has been widely used across academia and industry for nearly two decades. CUDA has become the de facto standard, and it only works with NVIDIA's products."", ""When the AI boom kicked off in late 2022, Nvidia's GPUs and CUDA platform represented the path of least resistance. There are capable AI accelerators from competitors, including Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, and cloud giants like Alphabet are increasingly designing their own custom AI chips. However, the CUDA software platform effectively locks customers into using Nvidia's GPUs."", ""Intel has been working on oneAPI, an open specification that's at the heart of the company's efforts to kick-start an alternative to CUDA, for the past few years. oneAPI is multi-architecture, meaning that a single code base can be used across CPUs, GPUs, and other types of chips, and multi-vendor, meaning it aims to support chips from any company. This is in stark contrast to CUDA, which is locked to Nvidia's GPUs."", ""Intel is far from the only company eager to see Nvidia's AI accelerator dominance erode. In late 2023, Intel came together with Arm Holdings, Alphabet's Google, Qualcomm, Samsung, and a few others to form the Unified Acceleration (UXL) Foundation. The core goal of this union is to build an open software ecosystem for all accelerators. Intel's oneAPI is at the center of this effort."", ""For companies like Google, which buys mountains of Nvidia's GPUs to power AI workloads for itself and its cloud customers, having alternatives to Nvidia could help cut down costs considerably. For companies like Qualcomm and Samsung, breaking CUDA's iron grip on the AI accelerator market makes it more likely that their own products will gain traction."", ""Samsung has concrete plans to enter the AI accelerator market in early 2025 with the launch of its Mach 1 chips. While Samsung's first effort will be focused on AI inference, not AI training, the software ecosystem will ultimately determine whether the chip is a success."", 'Meanwhile, Qualcomm is focused on integrating AI into all of its chips, an effort that will require software support to pay off. ""We\'re actually showing developers how you migrate out from an Nvidia platform,"" said Qualcomm\'s head of AI and machine learning in an interview with Reuters.', ""Intel is going after the AI market in multiple ways. The company sells its Gaudi line of AI accelerators, and it's been baking AI chips into its recent CPUs."", ""While the industrywide effort to break CUDA's dominance will make Intel's products more attractive, it's the company's semiconductor foundry business that may benefit the most. Intel plans to overtake foundry leader TSMC technologically in early 2025 with its Intel 18A process, and it has aspirations to become the world's second-largest foundry by 2030. The more competitive the AI accelerator market is, and the more chips that have AI capabilities built-in, the more potential customers for Intel's foundry."", ""While a more competitive AI chip market may hinder Intel's market share in AI accelerators, the company's foundry opportunity is enormous. Global foundry spending topped $100 billion in 2022, and it's expected to more than double to $231 billion by 2032. In the long run, Intel's foundry could be raking in tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually."", 'It will take time for the anti-CUDA efforts to gain traction. UXL is aiming to get the specifications for its open alternative to a mature state by the end of the year, an eternity in the fast-moving world of AI. It will take even more time to get developers on board in numbers that are big enough to matter.', ""But the reward for this effort will be a more competitive AI chip market.

144,b1c72241-d144-31fd-a7af-6d7e2940bf6b,JNJ,2024-03-28,3 Dividend Stocks That Are Likely to Raise Their Payouts in April,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b1c72241-d144-31fd-a7af-6d7e2940bf6b/3-dividend-stocks-that-are.html,1711620900,STORY,"['JNJ', 'COST', 'PG']","[""Dividend growth stocks often follow predictable patterns of when their next increases will take place. As long as their financials remain strong and there's room for a dividend hike, odds are that a business will increase its payout at around the same time as it did the year before. "", ""Based on when they last raised their dividend payments, three stocks that are likely to announce dividend hikes next month include Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG). Let's take a closer look at their track records and whether these are good dividend stocks to buy today."", ""Big-box retailer Costco doesn't offer investors the biggest yield at 0.6%, but it makes for an underrated dividend investment. That's because it occasionally surprises investors with a special dividend. Last year, it announced a $15 per share special dividend. That's massive when you consider that on an annual basis its regular dividend pays just $4.08 per share."", 'But the other reason it makes for a good dividend play is that Costco routinely increases its payouts. In April 2023, the company announced a 13% increase to its quarterly dividend, which now pays $1.02 per share. The dividend has more than doubled since the start of 2018 when the stock was paying $0.50 per quarter. ', ""Costco's modest 27% payout ratio makes it almost a lock to announce another rate hike in April. Although its yield may seem modest, long-term investors can still generate a lot of income from its dividends as the company has shown that it is not hesitant to reward its shareholders through rate hikes and special dividend payments. Costco isn't a cheap stock, trading at 48 times earnings, but if you're buying and holding for decades, this can still be a great investment to add to your portfolio today."", ""Johnson & Johnson has been increasing its payouts for decades. It's a Dividend King, and it would be big news if the company didn't raise its dividend in April. Continuous dividend hikes are a key reason investors buy and hold the stock as it offers a fairly high yield of 3.1%, and the rate increases mean that investors can collect more dividend income in the future."", ""On April 18, 2023, Johnson & Johnson announced a 5.3% increase to its quarterly dividend. It was the 61st consecutive year that the company raised its payout. Although the stock's payout ratio is near 90% (due to high litigation-related expenses in 2023), another rate hike is likely still coming in April. The healthcare giant projects adjusted operational sales growth of at least 5% in 2024 and adjusted earnings to rise by more than 6%. "", ""While a rate hike is probable, this may turn out to be one of the riskier dividend stocks to own, given the ongoing talc litigation and the risks Johnson & Johnson faces on that front. And that's the main reason why although this may seem like an otherwise great stock to own, it may not be worth investing in right now."", 'Top consumer company Procter & Gamble, which is known for popular brands such as Pampers, Bounty, and Tide, has also earned a reputation over the years as being a top dividend growth stock. Its impressive streak of dividend increases surpasses even Johnson & Johnson. Last April, the company announced a dividend hike, extending its streak to a 67th consecutive year. The 3% bump to the payout was a modest one, but in a span of five years the dividend has grown by 31%. ', ""Procter & Gamble's payout ratio is around 63%, which is where you might expect the ratio to fall for a company that prioritizes dividends but that also has a strong, growing business. At 2.3%, its yield is still higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.4% while giving investors an incentive to also stick around for the expected rate hikes. "", 'In the trailing 12 months, the company has generated $14.5 billion in earnings on sales of $83.9 billion for a solid profit margin of 17%. The stock trades at an estimated forward earnings multiple of 23, making Procter & Gamble a reasonably priced option for investors looking for a safe dividend stock to add to their portfolios today.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

At a median follow-up of 29.8 months (range, 0.4 to 62.0 months), KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting followed by KEYTRUDA as monotherapy after surgical resection significantly improved overall survival (OS), reducing the risk of death by 28% (HR=0.72 [95% CI, 0.56-0.93]; one-sided p=0.00517) in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB NSCLC versus placebo plus chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting followed by placebo after surgical resection, regardless of PD-L1 expression. For patients who received the KEYTRUDA-based regimen, median OS was not reached (95% CI, NR-NR) versus 52.4 months (95% CI, 45.7-NR) for patients who received the chemotherapy-placebo regimen. The KEYTRUDA-based regimen also improved event-free survival (EFS), reducing the risk of disease recurrence, progression or death by 41% (HR=0.59 [95% CI, 0.48-0.72]) compared to the chemotherapy-placebo regimen. For patients who received the KEYTRUDA-based regimen, median EFS was improved by nearly two and a half years compared to the chemotherapy-placebo regimen (47.2 months [95% CI, 32.9-NR] versus 18.3 months [95% CI, 14.8-22.1], respectively).', '""Despite the clinical advances for patients with metastatic lung cancer, lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer death in Europe, reinforcing the need to treat these patients in earlier stages of their disease, where we may have the most impact,"" said Dr. Solange Peters, chair of the medical oncology and thoracic malignancies department, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland. ""The approval of this KEYTRUDA-based regimen is an important milestone for patients diagnosed with resectable non-small cell lung cancer at high risk of recurrence, regardless of PD-L1 expression, providing a new option for these patients that has shown, through the results of the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-671 trial, the potential to help extend their lives.""', 'This approval allows marketing of this KEYTRUDA regimen for this indication in all 27 EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Northern Ireland. KEYTRUDA is now approved for six indications in NSCLC, and for 27 indications overall in the EU. In October 2023, KEYTRUDA was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with resectable (tumors ≥4 cm or node positive) NSCLC in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery.', '""Today’s approval of the first anti-PD-1/L1 therapy as part of a treatment regimen in Europe for the neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatment of resectable NSCLC based on positive overall survival results demonstrates our continued progress to advance treatments in earlier stages of lung cancer,"" said Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories.

Within 4‑12 weeks following surgery, placebo was administered every three weeks for up to 13 cycles.', 'About lung cancer', 'Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2022 alone, there were approximately 2.4 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 80% of all cases. In recent decades, the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer increased from 11% to 15% on average across EU countries. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced.', 'About Merck’s research in lung cancer', 'Merck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has six approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.', 'About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical program', 'Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease.

For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.', 'Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less.

She later took charge of a services division that helps support airline customers.', 'While Pope’s most recent position as Boeing’s chief operating officer gave her oversight of quality control, engineering, manufacturing and the supply chain, she’d been in the job only since January, hardly time to develop an intimate understanding of the issues plaguing the 737 Max.', 'Taking the reins at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, as the jetliner business is known, will require a far more hands-on approach and an inevitably steep learning curve. Deal was appointed to run BCA in 2019 after the Max was grounded worldwide in the wake of two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, later blamed on software that intervened in the flying of the aircraft.', 'The plane returned to the skies at the end of 2020 and Boeing has been striving to accelerate build rates ever since as it seeks to ship hundreds of delayed planes to disgruntled airlines.', 'At the same time it has encountered a series of manufacturing glitches, culminating in the Alaska Airlines incident.', 'Lee Hamilton, an aviation industry consultant with Leeham, says the problems are technical, not financial, and that a technical understanding should therefore be a prerequisite for anyone leading BCA.', 'He says: “I’m completely perplexed that Stephanie Pope has been made CEO of commercial aircraft. Nobody across the industry who I’ve spoken with can understand it.”', 'Hamilton says he was also contacted by a New York banker who expressed dismay at the news.', 'Deal probably had to go after four years during which he failed to resolve the quality-control problems, but a better choice to lead BCA would have been another woman, Elizabeth Lund, the division’s senior vice president of quality, according to Hamilton.', 'She has a degree in mechanical engineering and previously occupied posts including general manager of aircraft programmes, head of the 777, 747, and 767 programmes, and manager of Boeing’s sprawling Everett assembly plant near Seattle.', 'The jetliner arm of arch-rival Airbus has been led since January by a non-engineer in the shape of former sales chief Christian Scherer, though the company shares few of the production challenges currently confronting Boeing.', 'At stake for the US behemoth is its near-term profitability and standing with airlines, passengers and regulators, as well as its ability to compete with Airbus in future.', 'The European firm sprinted ahead in deliveries following the 737 Max crashes and the model’s subsequent grounding, and Boeing has made little headway towards closing the gap, delivering 528 planes in total last year against 735 at Airbus.', 'Already struggling to lift monthly production rates, Boeing was forced by the Federal Aviation Administration to put plans for a rapid increase this year on hold in the wake of the Alaska blowout, after a probe identified “unacceptable quality-assurance issues”.', 'Boeing failed 33 of 89 tests carried out by the FAA as part of a six-week audit of the 737 Max production process, while Spirit AeroSystems, which supplied the door plug, failed seven of 13, the New York Times reported this month.', 'Issues identified included five with the plug and others involving a cargo door and the installation of cockpit windows. Among irregular practices identified were the use of a hotel key card to assess door-seal integrity, and the application of washing up liquid as a lubricant to help fit the same seals.', 'The FAA has also highlighted non-compliance concerns in parts handling and storage, and product control. The delivery of 50 planes has separately been delayed by the discovery of improperly drilled holes in their fuselages.', 'Such has been the impact of the Max crisis on Boeing’s business that the airliner sector, once a cosy duopoly, is beginning to look permanently lopsided, with Airbus as the dominant player and the American firm a poor relation, in the narrowbody market at least.', 'Sash Tusa, an aviation analyst at Agency Partners, says a key factor in Boeing’s decline has been an absence of executives with a deep understanding of manufacturing at the top.', 'He says: “If Boeing is going to sort out this mess it needs to put engineers into senior positions. It’s the hollowing out of their engineering expertise that’s at the heart of all of these problems.”', 'Like Pope, chief executive Dave Calhoun, who will depart by December, holds a degree in accounting. Before joining Boeing in 2020 he worked for six years as head of portfolio operations at investment firm Blackstone. While he spent 26 years at General Electric, including the jet-engine arm, he worked mainly in finance and marketing roles.', 'Sir Tim Clark, the veteran head of Dubai-based Emirates, the world’s largest long-haul airline, said in comments after the reshuffle was announced that Boeing “needs a strong engineering lead as its head”, coupled with governance that prioritises safety and quality. He also backed calls from the US machinists union for a seat on the board, so that concerns from the factory floor can be better understood.', 'He said: “Time, unfortunately, is not on their side. I would suggest that some serious lateral thinking kicks in as soon as possible.”', 'Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary, was more conciliatory, releasing a video in which he said he looked forward to working with Pope, as well as Calhoun for the rest of his tenure, to eliminate 737 delivery delays.', 'O’Leary, who has said he’ll be looking for compensation for the impact of the delays on summer capacity, is himself a qualified accountant, having been employed at KPMG before working as a financial adviser to Ryanair founder Tony Ryan.', 'Unlike Calhoun and chairman Larry Kellner, who will exit after Boeing’s annual shareholder meeting in May, Deal departed straight away, leaving Pope to take immediate charge of the airliner division and its troubles.', 'Despite the industry’s reservations, she’s also being touted in some quarters as a possible successor to Calhoun himself, alongside General Electric boss Larry Culp, Carrier Global head David Gitlin and others.', 'A better choice for chief executive, Tusa says, might be Patrick Shanahan, chief of Spirit Aero, which Boeing is in talks to buy.', 'Shanahan has been in the top job at Spirit since October, when he was brought in on an interim basis to troubleshoot problems including earlier production errors concerning components supplied to the 737.', 'Prior to that he worked for more than 30 years at Boeing, occupying management roles across the full range of the company’s civil aircraft and leading the recovery of the 787 Dreamliner widebody programme after it was beset by production glitches that led to a three-year delay in service entry. He left in 2019 for a two-year stint as Donald Trump’s deputy defence secretary.', 'The challenge facing Pope, the 737 Max and Boeing as a whole aren’t limited to the production line. Even before the crashes and manufacturing crisis the plane was struggling to match the sales success of the Airbus A320neo series narrowbody.', 'While both models are re-engined versions of older aircraft, the Airbus jet was less constrained by the limits of how far its design could be expanded. That’s reflected in sales tallies, with the 737 Max accruing fewer than 6,500 orders, compared with more than 10,000 for the A320neo, including 500-plus for a variant that can fly further than any Max.', 'So popular is the Airbus jet that new purchasers face a wait of several years for it to be delivered, something that’s paradoxically helping to sustain interest in the Boeing model, which is more easily available.', 'Tusa says: “It’s come to something when Boeing’s best-selling plane is getting orders really only because Airbus has no spare capacity. Boeing has to sort out the production issues, of course, but it also needs to recognise that it has a deeper problem in that the Max is simply not competitive.’’', 'The only answer is to begin work on a successor to the Max now, he says, rather than offering one by the mid-2030s as currently envisaged, something that would further add to Pope’s worry list.', 'A Boeing spokesman said that about half of Pope’s leadership team is made up of engineers. The company also cited comments from Calhoun in a message to staff in which he said that she had “a proven track record of superb leadership”.', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Sportswear juggernaut Nike (NYSE: NKE) is one of them. For the three-month period that ended Feb. 29 (fiscal Q3 2024), the global leader in sports apparel and footwear posted revenue of $12.4 billion and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.77. Both figures easily beat Wall Street's expectations. "", ""However, the stock immediately dipped 7% following the news. As of this writing, shares of Nike sit a whopping 47% below their all-time high from November 2021. That's despite this being a phenomenal stock over the past few decades. So, is it a smart idea to buy the dip?"", ""To its credit, Nike was able to exceed analysts' forecasts, but investors are concerned about other factors that add some context to the latest numbers. For starters, that Q3 revenue figure was basically flat year over year. "", ""Nike may have beaten expectations in the important North America region, but China was a different story. In what has typically been Nike's fastest-growing region, things are cooling off. Revenue in China was up just 5% compared to Q3 2023."", 'More broadly, Nike is dealing with consumers who are less interested in spending on discretionary items. That makes sense, given ongoing inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and a still-uncertain macro backdrop.', ""The bright spot, however, was that gross margin is holding up. It came in at 44.8% last quarter, up from 43.3% in the year-ago period. Favorable pricing helped counteract ongoing promotional activity. Nike's inventory balance also decreased 13% over the past 12 months. "", ""One of Nike's key rivals, premium brand Lululemon Athletica, also reported a sales slowdown in its latest fiscal quarter. However, the athleisure pioneer was still able to grow revenue 16% during that period. This highlights just how weak the demand is that Nike is facing these days."", ""There also isn't much to get excited about when it comes to Nike's near-term outlook. Management reiterated that sales will likely rise by only 1% this fiscal year. Making matters worse, for the first half of fiscal 2025, which roughly coincides with the second half of calendar 2024, revenue is expected to decline."", 'Like many businesses out there, Nike has embarked on cost-cutting efforts to right-size operations in a lower-demand environment. About three months ago, executives revealed plans to cut $2 billion across the organization over the next three years, with a focus on simplifying product offerings, reducing management layers, and increasing automation. ', ""Nike also implemented worker layoffs. I'm sure initial results from these moves helped the company beat consensus estimates for EPS. In my opinion, it's always encouraging to see a business place extra attention on figuring out ways to cut expenses. The issue, though, is that there is a limit to how much can be done. After a certain point, management needs to get back to thinking about growth, which is a serious concern right now."", ""At the end of fiscal 2021, the executive team laid out long-term financial targets. One goal was to achieve mid- to high-teens EPS growth over the next four years. We are nearing the end of that forecast period, and Nike is coming up well short of its objectives. So it's not easy to be optimistic at all about this business and the direction it's heading in."", ""The shares would be a screaming buy if they sold at a cheap valuation, but that's not the case. Nike stock sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.4. Not only should investors wait for growth to pick back up, but they should also wait for a major valuation pullback before scooping up shares."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

But what if a forgotten player still holds hidden potential? eBay, once a pioneer in online commerce, might be exactly that. This article dives into why this familiar name could be an exciting opportunity for investors seeking value in the tech sector."", ""eBay's journey began in 1995 as AuctionWeb, a hobby project connecting buyers and sellers. The first sale on the site was a broken laser pointer! From there, it ballooned quickly, with its official name change to eBay in 1997 and an IPO a year later."", 'A key move came in 2002 with the acquisition of PayPal, solidifying their online transaction power. However, eBay spun off PayPal in 2015, focusing on core marketplace operations and building a strong seller base. While not the giant it once was, eBay remains a major force in e-commerce today.', 'Although eBay stock has not recorded exceptional returns in the last 15 years, they are still respectable, even if below market performance. Over that time the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 9.8%, and now pays a tidy 2.1% dividend to shareholders.', 'However, there are several bullish catalysts that I think could send the stock higher in the near term.', 'eBay currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting steadily upward trending earnings revisions. FY24 earnings estimates have been raised by 3.6% and are expected to grow 8% YoY, while FY25 have risen by 4.5% and are projected to climb 7% YoY.', 'Shares outstanding in eBay have steadily declined, more than halving in the last ten years. With management buying back shares at such a pace, you can call eBay a share cannibal. This activity is fantastic news as it shows a further commitment to returning cash to shareholders and keeps a steady bid under the stock.', 'When looking at the technical chart for eBay, we can see the price just initiated a stage one breakout, a signal that can precede extended bull runs. eBay stock has been consolidating near its recent lows for two years and has now made a convincing move higher.', 'Furthermore, we have a smaller bull flag from which to measure a continuation trade. If EBAY can clear the $52 level, we can confirm a multi-timeframe breakout. Unless the stock breaks back down below the $50 level, I remain bullish.', ""Although eBay's business isn't growing at a fast pace, the mix of share buybacks, rising earnings estimates, and a technical setup make for a worthy consideration. Additionally, it should be noted that eBay enjoys a reasonable valuation of 11.2x forward earnings, well below its 15-year median of 18.3x."", 'Thus, for investors seeking an under-the-radar stock idea, EBAY may make for a strong addition to your investment portfolio.', ""Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? "", ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Long-term shareholders (like myself) have felt a lot of pain since PayPal peaked at $308 per share in 2021. However, within the past six months, the stock has crossed into valuation territory often reserved for companies that are shrinking, not growing.', 'Many investors have wondered if PayPal might see a resurgence like Meta Platforms did in 2023, and with the stock up more than 10% from its March lows, it could be the start of a major bull run.', 'So, is it time to buy PayPal stock? Or is this just a false dawn?', ""PayPal has long been the face of the fintech industry. It helped smoothly transfer money from one person to another and process business transactions. However, competitors eventually rose and took some of PayPal's market share, including vital streams like eBay and various mobile payment apps."", 'Now, PayPal seems like a legacy app to many consumers. But it can also be an easy way to manage all payment types a consumer has and quickly process transactions for e-commerce stores because PayPal already has the user information. Quick transactions are key for any store, as they give the consumer less time to second-guess themselves. This makes partnering with PayPal a smart idea, which is why PayPal options have become more prevalent at online checkouts in recent years.', ""Speeding up the checkout process and giving the user more information is at the core of PayPal's six new innovations for its platform, which new Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss unveiled in early 2024. But it remains to be seen if this can kick-start growth for PayPal."", ""It's the market's assumption that PayPal is a failing business that can never recover, which is why it trades for such a deep discount."", 'Indeed, 17 times trailing and 13 times forward earnings is dirt cheap, especially considering that the S&P 500 trades at 23 times trailing at 22 times forward earnings.', ""The broader market is shunning PayPal, but management isn't sitting around doing nothing."", ""Thanks to PayPal's cheap valuation, the previous management team spent a lot of its cash flows on repurchasing shares. Chriss and his new team projected at least $5 billion in buybacks in 2024, so the trend will continue."", ""But how significant is a $5 billion share repurchase program? It's quite a big deal."", 'After subtracting the $1.56 billion in stock-based compensation expenses PayPal incurred in 2023, the net effect of the repurchase will be about $3.44 billion. With PayPal currently valued at $72 billion, this would reduce the shares outstanding by about 5% each year.', ""That means if PayPal has the exact same net income in 2024 as in 2023, its earnings per share will rise 5.3%. Remember, that's with no growth. However, PayPal also projects mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth in Q1."", 'Looking further out, Wall Street analysts project PayPal to continue this trend for 2024 and 2025, with an average of 42 analysts projecting 7% and 8% revenue growth this year and next.', 'If PayPal can grow in the high single digits while reducing its shares outstanding by 5%, it can produce earnings per share (EPS) growth rates in the low double digit percentages. That could lead to a market-beating stock.', 'This would undoubtedly unlock some new interest in owning the shares, which would cause its cheap valuation to increase. As a result, the PayPal rally may have already begun, with investors anticipating stronger-than-expected Q1 results.', ""We won't know how PayPal is doing until late April, but there are enough positive signs now and a high margin of safety that I'd be comfortable buying PayPal's stock right now."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", ""Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum ', 'As you can see below, Marathon Petroleum had US$26.8b of debt, at December 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$10.2b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$16.6b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Marathon Petroleum had liabilities of US$20.2b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$34.4b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$10.2b and US$11.6b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$32.7b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""Marathon Petroleum has a very large market capitalization of US$71.0b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution."", 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.', ""Marathon Petroleum's net debt is only 0.98 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 18.6 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. It is just as well that Marathon Petroleum's load is not too heavy, because its EBIT was down 31% over the last year. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Marathon Petroleum's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Marathon Petroleum produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 78% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to."", ""Marathon Petroleum's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. There's no doubt that its ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT is pretty flash. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Marathon Petroleum's use of debt. While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Marathon Petroleum (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) ."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

The question is whether it and other efforts will be spectacular and different enough to convince consumers and shareholders that GM can go from American Revolution to American evolution. Investors have put GM's stock in the show-me category amid volatile earnings reports the last few years."", ""GM shares trade at a massive discount on a PE basis not only to the market, but relative to its highest profile rival Tesla. GM stock is also trading at a big discount to what its own hard assets are worth, things like real estate and factories, even a $10 billion stock buyback plan, something GM announced in late 2023 is a big sign that the company itself thinks its stock is undervalued and will be worth more down the road. It hasn't yet won over all the naysayers."", 'What is the most important thing you need to execute on to win over shareholders?', 'MARY BARRA: Well, we clearly have to demonstrate that the Ultium platform allows us to have a portfolio of profitable EVs that customers want to buy. Critical. That we have software in our vehicles that enables a better customer experience and easier customer experience, and surprises, and delights. And then that we craft the future path for cruise.', 'I mean, I really think it comes down to doing those three things well while delivering the financial results. And doing the right thing for our owners, our shareholders.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: Which means not doing everything at once. That includes decisions like pausing all autonomous vehicle activities at the end of 2023 when one of GM's Cruise robotaxis ran over a woman causing injuries. GM revealed the self-driving unit is under two federal investigations into the incident."", ""Barra also announced on GM's latest earnings call the company is cutting spending on the cruise division by $1 billion.

I'm also very focused that we have software that creates a whole new customer experience. And then autonomy, when you think about self-driving vehicles, it really takes us to a safer place. Our vision is to create a world with zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion. And I hope people in five years say they've done that and they're in a leadership position because of it."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: While Barra remains hyper focused on keeping GM not only profitable, but relevant enrolling in the 21st century, she still makes family a priority in her life. And yes, she tries her best to unplug at night.', ""MARY BARRA: I think every leader is different. But for me, I do need a little bit of a break because I think it allows you to have a fresh perspective. And I think you need to not disconnect. You're still doing emails every day."", ""You're always on call. I think is really important to get that break to get to just-- many times, I've woken up with a fresh perspective."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: A fresh leadership perspective that Barra hopes keeps a legacy automaker like GM competitive and successful in the uncertain years to come.', 'How important is 2024 for GM?', ""MARY BARRA: 2024 is really a critical year because this is a year of execution. And we need to demonstrate. And we're on track now. We had some challenges last year with building battery modules to put into the packs."", ""We're on our ramp plan now. I'm really proud of how hard the team has worked. So this is a critical year-- also a critical year for software. We have really brought in a new software team from Silicon Valley last year."", ""And they've made a lot of change to improve how we develop software, to improve how we validate software.

As many of you have probably seen on the news this morning, the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in Baltimore. Our thoughts go out to everyone impacted by this terrible tragedy. We have activated a team and are monitoring the situation. We are pleased to start the year with a strong first quarter. Our performance reflects the early success of our prioritized investments to improve volume trends and drive profitable growth. I will begin my remarks this morning with an overview of our first quarter results, focusing on top-line drivers. Next, I will provide perspective on industry trends, highlight some early signposts of success, as well as areas we continue to work on and review our growth plans.', 'Mike will then go into more depth on the first quarter financial results and review our 2024 outlook, and finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments. Turning now to our results on slide four. In the first quarter, sales grew 2% in constant currency, reflecting a 3% contribution from pricing, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume and product mix, primarily driven by the pruning of low-margin business and our canning business divestiture. Underlying volume was flat compared to the prior year. Sequentially from the fourth quarter, volume trends improved in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions. We believe this improvement is an indication of continued progress as we remain focused on driving quality top-line growth throughout our portfolio.', 'In Consumer, volumes improved substantially from the fourth quarter in the Americas. In EMEA, we drove positive volume growth while continuing to benefit from pricing actions. In Asia Pacific, volume performance was impacted by the macro environment in China, as we expected. We continue to expect full year 2024 China Consumer sales to be comparable to 2023. Outside of China, we delivered strong sales growth driven by both price and volume. In Flavor Solutions, our results were solid and growth was driven by price and underlying volume growth, partially offset by the impact of our canning divestiture. We are pleased with our performance recognizing many of our customers, including Consumer Product Companies or CPGs and Quick Service Restaurants or QSRs, continue to experience volume softness in their businesses.', ""We are continuing to collaborate with our customers to navigate this challenging environment and we remain optimistic about our growth for the year. It's worth noting that volume trends and Flavor Solutions typically fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, largely attributable to customer activity, including new product launches, limited time offers, and their other promotional activity. As we said at the CAGNY conference, McCormick is a growth company, and 2024 is an important investment year to return to our long-term objectives. Our results demonstrate the early impact of investments we have made to fuel our top-line and further capitalize on the underlying growth of our categories. We have a robust set of initiatives and continue to expect share gains in units to lead our trends and our results will build throughout 2024."", ""Let me share some of our perspectives on industry trends. We are in a unique position with our portfolio's breadth and reach in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions. Our shared insights give us a very strong understanding of consumers flavor needs, preferences, behaviors, and trends. Consumers remain challenged. Two years of steep inflation has had an impact and many are exhibiting value seeking behavior. While food inflation is slowing, its compounded impact is still being felt by consumers. Budgets are stretched, resulting in choiceful spending decisions, a trend that is continuing from the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, with higher inflation in the food service channel and slowing retail food prices, we broadly saw a shift from food away-from-home to food-at-home consumption in our major markets."", 'We are also seeing improvement in center store categories and some softness in restaurant traffic across all regions. As we said, the current state of the consumer is not defined by any one trend, it remains dynamic, and we are responding with speed and agility. I am encouraged by the early success of our key initiatives. We have the right plans in place that are continually influenced by what matters most to our consumers and customers, and fit within our strategic priorities. Moving to slide five, let me highlight for the quarter some of the key signposts of our success that demonstrate we have the right plans in place. Starting with spices and seasonings. In Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, excluding China, we grew volumes. In the U.S., our unit share performance continues to improve and we drove dollar share gains in Eastern Europe.', ""In recipe mixes, we strengthened our performance with volume growth in the Americas, reversing the trends from the fourth quarter. Recipe mixes were a significant driver of U.K. volume growth and homemade desserts were also a substantial driver of France's volume growth. In both, we realized both unit and dollar market share gains. Volume growth in our Flavors business is strong across key categories, including outpacing the category in alcoholic beverages and performance nutrition. Finally, we grew volume in branded foodservice and realized market share gains in spices and seasonings and on Tabletop in hot sauces. Before I get into our growth plans, let me touch on some areas where there is some pressure. We continue to experience volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like Frozen and Asian."", 'In Americas Consumer, importantly, these items represent a small part of our portfolio and the improved volume trends in our core categories is beginning to offset these declines. For mustard in Americas Consumer, as we discussed in our last earnings call, we continue to experience extremely low price points for private label, which is impacting our consumption and driving down category dollars. While performance in mustard improved relative to the fourth quarter, we still have work ahead of us. We plan to drive further volume improvement by narrowing price gaps and increasing promotions, new products, including Creamy Dill Pickle, and importantly through recent distribution wins. Moving to hot sauce, in Americas Consumer of consumption, volume trends improved from the fourth quarter, particularly coinciding with our successful Super Bowl activation campaign.', ""Reflecting on our first quarter performance, it highlights two dynamics. First, we have underlying strength in our base business and strong consumer loyalty. Our growth plans remain consistent, fueling growth through increasing both Cholula and Frank's RedHot brand marketing, with Frank's activated year-round for the first time, as well as exciting innovation aligned with consumer trends and expanding distribution. Second, recently we have seen a surge in $1 price point trial sizes from new and existing small players, which is incremental to the category and is pressuring our share performance. We remain the leader in this attractive, fragmented and growing category. New buyers present a great opportunity to win new households using our growth levers, as well as our scale and capabilities."", 'In Flavors, our growth with Quick Serve Restaurants and Flavor Solutions was impacted by slower QSR traffic in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Finally, some of our consumer packaged food customers continue to experience softness in volumes within their own business, in both Americas and EMEA. We are focused on working with our customers to support their innovation plans and continue to diversify our customer base over time. Before I talk through our growth plans in detail, let me touch on spices and seasonings. At a global level, we are pleased with the growth and consumption we delivered in the quarter. Specifically looking at U.S. spices and seasonings, we are driving significant improvements. Our new packaging continues to increase velocity on shelf, and we are recapturing distribution points, and our sequential improvement led to positive unit share gains at the end of the quarter.', ""In addition, our growth is supported by our increased brand marketing and new products. Lastly, we expect to largely start seeing the impact of our actions in our results during the second half of the year, following most of our customers shelf resets at the end of the second quarter. Let's now move to our growth plans on slide six, which are leading our strong first quarter performance and will continue to drive our success in 2024 and beyond. Brand marketing, new products, and packaging innovation, category management, proprietary technologies, and customer engagement continue to be the initiatives behind our growth levers. Starting with brand marketing, our plans across all categories are supported by our global brand marketing initiatives."", 'We are prioritizing investments to connect with consumers and fuel growth. Our differentiated brand marketing is driven by a combination of factors. In addition to maintaining a high share of voice, we are committed to having the best content in our categories. Content that inspires and educates consumers and reaches them at the right points on their path to purchase and their flavor journey. From flavor exploration and menu planning, to shopping and cooking, and even to eating and sharing the experience online. In Q1, brand marketing spend was up significantly compared to the prior year as expected. This increase was broad-based across all regions and was an important driver in improving volumes. Through our efforts across multiple channels, particularly in retail media, we are driving further household penetration and increasing buy rates across spices and seasonings, recipe mixes, and condiments.', 'Our holiday campaigns across our regions proved successful. Our marketing campaigns in the Americas highlight our everyday value and point-of-difference to consumers and are supporting our improved volume trends and share improvement. Our Frank Super Bowl activation campaign with Jason Kelce, now a retired NFL player, was very successful. We gained new buyers and media and consumer sentiment, as well as engagement from other big brands, was incredibly positive. We continue to benefit from new products and packaging. It is one of the primary drivers of our growth and as we said at CAGNY, the performance of our launches continues to improve. We are continuing to realize growth from our 2023 launches. For example, our Cholula sauces and recipe mixes are driving new buyers to the category and are exceeding our expectations since launch, and we continue to build U.S. distribution and are also launching both formats in Canada this year.', ""The rollout of our U.S. Everyday Herbs & Spices portfolio is on plan and expected to be fully shifted by the end of the second quarter. Our Nadiya Hussain range of Schwartz seasonings and recipe mixes continue to drive our innovation performance and expand household penetration with younger consumers. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, with our renovated recipe mixes, we have opportunities to win more dinner occasions with new global cuisine seasonings in both Americas and the AMEA and reshaping the portfolio by shifting offerings to meet consumers growing preference for non-red meat proteins. In Seasoning Blend, an exciting growth opportunity we mentioned at CAGNY, we are launching new Lawry's, seasoning blends in large sizes, which offer a value price point to consumers."", ""And we are really excited about the Frank's RedHot dips and popular flavors in a squeeze bottle format we just launched and are looking forward to another campaign featuring Jason Kelce. In Flavor Solutions, we are leveraging our proprietary technologies to support our innovation in flavors, to win new customers, diversifying our customer base, and drive share gains across our portfolio. Our momentum with our flavors customers continues to be strong and fuel our new product pipeline. We are collaborating with many of our customers to heat up their products from snacking to beverages. Our heat-brief win rates are strong across our regions. We continue to dedicate resources where we have the right to win. In Branded Food Service, we have a strong innovation agenda, including launching a Cattlemen's Hawaiian Barbecue flavor, expanding our Seasonings portfolio with Ducros line extensions, and extending McCormick Mayonesa, which has had great performance in our consumer segment into this channel."", ""Let's turn to category management, where I'd like to review our revenue management efforts and expanding distribution. First, revenue management remains a capability and we have a history of optimizing pricing on shelf to benefit both McCormick and the retailer. We continue to take a surgical approach to managing our price gaps to private label and branded competitors. Our price investments are primarily focused in Americas consumer, where they impact about 15% of our portfolio in that segment. Revenue management will continue to be an important tool for driving growth, and we will consistently leverage real-time analytics and insights to refine our plans. In terms of expanding distribution, we continue to make progress on restoring a majority of the distribution that was lost due to supply issues."", ""We have secured winds and new distribution. To further strengthen our value proposition in EMEA, we have grown distribution in the fast growing discount channel, and in the U.S., our Lawry's opening price point is expanding across the stores of a leading discounter. And in China, we are expanding in small format stores, which have grown rapidly in recent years, as well as into third and fourth-tier cities. We are meeting the consumer where they live and shop. Let me briefly mention our heat platform. As you heard in my remarks, heat-infused products span our portfolio and are driving growth. We expect heat to continue to be a long-term growth accelerator globally for McCormick. Consumers, particularly younger generations, continue to drive demand in this flavor profile."", 'We are uniquely positioned to win in heat with our global iconic brands and our meaningful scale and expertise that we have been building for decades. To wrap up, we believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories, and McCormick, which will differentiate and strengthen our leadership. As we look ahead to 2024, we are maintaining our outlook. Mike will share more of the details. At a high level, we expect our top-line to be at the mid to high-end of our guidance range, given the momentum we saw in the first quarter. We are confident in our initiatives and we have provided proof points of where they are working. That said, we also continue to reflect on the uncertainty in the consumer environment in our outlook for 2024.', 'Before I pass the call to Mike, let me reiterate a few points. We are deliberately focused on attractive, high-growth categories across both segments, resulting in a significant long-term tailwind to drive profitable growth. That said, it is crucial that we continue to capitalize on this position of strength. The long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, flavorful exploration, and trusted brands continue to be very strong. And, importantly, consumer enjoyment in cooking is growing. We remain dedicated to improving volumes. We continue to refine our plans and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth. And, you should continue to expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond.', 'Now, over to Mike.', 'Mike Smith: Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide eight. Our top-line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the first quarter of last year, reflecting 3% of pricing benefit, offset by a 1% volume and mix decline. As expected, volumes were impacted by our strategic decision to exit DSD, Direct Store Delivery, of our bagged Hispanic spices in the Americas. The exit of a private label product line, and the divestiture of a small canning business in EMEA. Underlying volume and mix performance was flat for the quarter, reflecting a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter where total underlying volume growth was down approximately 3%. In our consumer segment, constant currency sales growth of 1% reflects a 3% increase in pricing actions, offset by a 2% volume decline, which is due to a 1% impact from the DSD business exit I just mentioned, lower volume and product mix in the Americas, specifically in Prepared Food Categories, including Frozen and Asian, consistent with our expectations, and the impact of the macro environment in China.', 'On slide nine, consumer sales in the Americas were comparable to last year. Contribution from price was offset by a volume and mix decline of 3%. This decline was fully attributable to the DSD exit and lower volume and product mix in the Prepared Food Categories I just mentioned. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 8%, with a 5% increase in pricing actions and 3% volume growth. Sales growth was broad-based across product categories in our major markets. We are pleased with the volume growth we delivered in EMEA and expect the momentum to continue through 2024. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region were down 5%, driven by a 6% volume decrease, primarily due to the macro environment in China. Outside of China, we drove high single-digit sales growth with price and volume contributing equally, and the growth was broad-based across categories and markets.', 'Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment and slide 12, we grew first quarter constant currency sales by 2%, with pricing contributing 2% and volume contributing 1%, partially offset by a 1% decline due to the divestiture of the canning business and the exit of a private label product line in EMEA. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 3%, reflecting a 2% contribution from price and 1% growth in volume and product mix. Sales growth was led by Flavor, most notably in performance nutrition and branded food service. In EMEA, constant currency sales decreased by 1%, including a 3% impact from the divestiture of the canning business. Pricing actions of 4% were partially offset by lower volume and product mix of 2%, primarily attributable to the exit of the private label product line I mentioned earlier.', 'In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency, with a 4% contribution from pricing and 1% volume growth. Outside of China, sales remain negatively impacted by geopolitical boycotts some of our quick service restaurant customers are experiencing in Southeast Asia. As seen on slide 16, gross profit margins expanded by 140 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period. Drivers in the quarter included favorable product mix, the benefit of our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement or CCI, and our Global Operating Effectiveness Program or GOE, as well as effective price realization. As we look to the second quarter, we expect gross margins to modestly expand compared to the year ago period, as we realized our highest level of pricing and cost recovery in the second quarter of 2023.', 'This trend may differ from our historical cadence, where gross margin increases sequentially every quarter throughout the year. However, we continue to expect higher margins in the second half compared to the first half of the year. Now moving to slide 17, selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased relative to the first quarter of last year, driven by brand marketing and research and development investments, which are partially offset by CCI and GOE cost savings. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 110 basis points. Brand marketing increased significantly compared to the prior year. Our investments are yielding results, and we anticipate continuing to invest behind these efforts. Sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in an increase in adjusted operating income of 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and 4% in constant currency.', 'Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment was up 2%, with minimal impact from currency. In Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 15% and included a 1% currency impact. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability, and in the first quarter, as expected, we drove margin expansion versus the prior year in this segment. Our performance this quarter reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make continued investments in 2024 to fuel top line growth. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on slide 18. Our interest expense was comparable to the prior year. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5% compared to 21.8% in the year ago period. Our tax rate in the prior year benefited from discrete tax items.', ""We expect these benefits to occur later in the year for us in 2024. As a result, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the first quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We're the market leader with our McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalades and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash-flow results. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 20, first quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share was $0.63 as compared to $0.59 for the year ago period. The increase was attributable to higher operating income driven by sales growth and gross margin expansion, as well as the results from McCormick de Mexico joint venture partially offset by higher adjusted effective tax rate."", ""On slide 21, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was strong in the first quarter $138 million compared to $103 million in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements. We returned $113 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $62 million for capital expenditures. As a reminder, capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt."", 'Importantly, we remain committed to a strong investment grade rating and continue to expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. Now turning to our 2024 financial outlook on slide 22. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. At the top line, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. Given the momentum in the first quarter, we expect to be closer to the midpoint to high end of our guidance range.', ""In terms of pricing, we continue to expect a favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions, most significantly in the first half, partially offset by our price cap management investments that will drive volume growth. We expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses. Through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making. As we noted, our initiatives will take time to materialize and we continue to expect to return to volume growth during the second half of the year, absent any new macroeconomic headwinds. Starting in the second quarter, we will have lapped the impact of the DSD and private label product line business exits. The divestiture of the Giotti canning business will impact us through the third quarter."", 'We expect to continue to prune lower margin business throughout the year as we optimize our portfolio. The impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales. Finally in China, our food away-from-home business, which is included in APAC consumer, is expected to be impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year, and as such, we expect China consumer sales to be comparable to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility and demand in China, we continue to believe in a long-term growth trajectory of the China business. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix, and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of low single-digit increases in cost inflation and our increased investments.', 'Additionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new Flavor Solutions facility in the U.K. in the back half of the year. Moving to adjusted operating income, we expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion, as well as SG&A cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partially offset by CCI savings, and we continue to expect our increased investments in brand marketing to be concentrated in the first half of the year. Our 2024 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography, as well as factoring in discrete impacts.', 'We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick de Mexico. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023. As we head into the second quarter, let me summarize some of the puts and takes. We expect a drive volume improvement, with some pressure expected in Flavor Solutions due to the trends Brendan mentioned earlier. Fully wrapped the impact of pricing actions we took in the prior year and activated a significant portion of our price cap management efforts, and continue our investments in brand marketing, as our programs are working and driving growth. As a result, our operating profit will likely be less robust for the second quarter.', 'However, we continue to anticipate strong profit growth in the second half of the year. As Brendan noted, we are dedicated to improving volumes. We are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 financial outlook.', 'Brendan Foley : Thank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaway on slide 23. First quarter results in our volume trajectory demonstrate that we are making the right investments to drive long-term sustainable organic growth and reinforces our confidence. We are executing on proven strategies and investing behind our business with speed and agility and in alignment to consumer behavior, and capitalizing on our advantage categories across segments. We are able to do this and continue to make great progress on managing costs, led by our GOE and CCI programs, to support our increased investments in the business and drive margin expansion. Our performance for the quarter, coupled with our growth plans, give us confidence in achieving the mid-to-high end of our projected constant currency sales growth for 2024.', 'Finally, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions and reiterate my confidence that together we will drive the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 outlook.

Two notable developments helped push the aggregate growth picture into positive territory – the Tech sector resumed its traditional growth-driver status, and net margins turned positive.', 'Expectations for 2024 Q1 and beyond show that the Tech sector is expected to remain a core growth driver, and the margin outlook will continue to improve.', '2024 Q1 earnings are expected to increase +2.5% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues.', 'Please note that the magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates compares favorably to what we had seen in the comparable period for 2023 Q4.', 'Since the start of Q1, estimates have come down for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors.

Named after mathematician, statistician, and pioneering game theorist David Blackwell, the new graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware is designed to deliver unprecedented processing power for generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications."", ""Made possible by a roughly $10 billion research and development budget, the first GB200 Blackwell processors are expected to deliver a major leap forward compared to the company's existing Hopper H100 GPUs. Nvidia expects to begin shipping the first generation of Blackwell chips later this year. A single GB200 GPU is expected to sell for somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000, and CEO Jensen Huang believes the new processor will quickly become the most successful product in the company's history."", ""What does the upcoming release of Blackwell mean for Nvidia's stock? And how will this incredibly powerful new GPU reshape the AI landscape?"", ""With a market capitalization of roughly $2.4 trillion, Nvidia now ranks as the third-most valuable of the Magnificent Seven companies. The AI leader's stock soared 259% over the last year as skyrocketing demand for its GPUs powered incredible sales and earnings growth. Now, the company has a new processor on the horizon that looks poised to deliver incredible tech breakthroughs."", ""Nvidia's GB200 is expected to be roughly four times as fast as its H100 GPUs, which are currently top of the line and favored for powering today's most advanced AI applications. Given the dramatic performance improvements delivered by the first generation of Blackwell chips, it's reasonable to expect that these new processors will pave the way for dramatic new advancements in AI technologies."", ""Nvidia already said that Blackwell is being adopted by every major global cloud-services provider. It's also seeing strong demand from AI-focused companies, telecom providers, and a range of other technology businesses. Heralding the arrival of what looks to be another breakthrough moment for artificial intelligence, Blackwell's unveiling was paired with endorsements from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and other high-profile tech leaders and luminaries."", ""But crucially, Blackwell is part of a much larger ecosystem strategy. Check out this quote from Nvidia's Jensen Huang:"", ""Blackwell is both a chip at the heart of the system, but it's really a platform. It's basically a computer system. What Nvidia does for a living is not build the chip. We build an entire supercomputer, from the chip to the system to the interconnects, the NVLinks, the networking, but very importantly the software."", ""Nvidia will also be using its next-generation GPUs to advance its position and ambitions in the software space. Leading AI developers already rely on Nvidia's CUDA software to create applications that are powered by the company's processors, and the appeal of the high-performance Blackwell processors should help ensure that customers continue to use its software."", 'The strategy extends even further. During a meeting at GTC, Huang had this to say: ""You can build chips to make software run better, but you can\'t create a new market without software. What makes us unique is that we\'re the only chip company I believe that will create its own market.""', 'With the release of the GB200, Nvidia appears to be on track to open the door for the creation of new categories of AI software applications. In turn, the launch, scaling, and continued evolution of such software could create even more demand for its ultrahigh-end GPUs.', ""Reuters reported on March 25 that companies including Alphabet, Qualcomm, and Intel are teaming up to create an organization aimed at stopping Nvidia from establishing an unassailably dominant position in AI. The group's UXL Foundation is aiming to create a software suite that will help run AI applications on a wider range of processors and reduce reliance on Nvidia's platforms."", ""According to the report, the UXL Foundation is now looking to recruit Microsoft, Amazon, and other influential technology players. So while many of the biggest names in tech are excited about Blackwell's capabilities, there's understandably resistance to the broader AI space becoming overly reliant on Nvidia's ecosystem."", ""To some extent, the formation of the UXL Foundation speaks to just how strong Nvidia's competitive positioning is right now. The company commands roughly 90% of the market for the kinds of GPUs used for AI and other accelerated computing applications, and the launch of Blackwell will likely help it maintain or even expand its dominance. Paired with an expanding array of purpose-tailored software tools, Nvidia is on track to reshape the AI landscape -- and its competitors and potential rivals have a lot of catching up to do."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

I\'ve been bullish on Nvidia for a long time.', ""You're absolutely right on every one of those counts. And no, I haven't changed my mind. I'm still as bullish on Nvidia as ever. Here's the thing: The stock is selling for 80 times earnings and 39 times sales, and despite its growth trajectory, some investors won't even consider a stock with a valuation of that magnitude, even if the forward multiples of 38 times earnings and 18 times sales are more favorable."", 'For investors who have absolutely no intention of buying Nvidia at this level, I offer two alternatives from among the other six stocks in the Magnificent Seven: of Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla.', 'These stocks still have significant upside but with more reasonable valuations.

In response to the accelerating demand for generative AI, Amazon beefed up its cloud offerings, providing the company with a compelling opportunity for future growth.', ""Let's not forget Amazon's digital advertising business. The company was already the third largest online advertiser, behind just Google and Meta Platforms -- and that was before Amazon added advertisements to its Prime Video that will surely boost its revenue."", 'Investors might be surprised to find that, of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Amazon is the hands-down favorite among Wall Street analysts, not Nvidia. Of the 47 analysts who cover Amazon, 91% rate the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommends selling. Only 55% rate Nvidia stock a buy, with the rest moving to hold or sell based on valuation concerns.', ""When it comes to Amazon, Mizuho analyst James Lee is the most bullish among his Wall Street colleagues. He has a buy rating and $230 price target on the stock, which suggests roughly 30% upside. The analyst cites improving revenue for AWS and operating efficiency gains for Amazon's e-commerce business as fueling his positive take."", ""Given the multiple drivers for future growth, it's easy to see why Amazon is a favorite among Wall Street analysts. Furthermore, at less than 3 times next year's sales, Amazon stock is a bargain."", ""It's not difficult to see the appeal of Microsoft. It's best known for its ubiquitous Windows operating system and its leading suite of business productivity software, Office, which provides the company with a strong foundation upon which to build its future."", ""Microsoft Azure is the No. 2 Cloud provider, with 26% of the market, and growth recently accelerated to 30% year over year in the most recent quarter, outpacing AWS and Google Cloud at 13% and 26%, respectively. Helping fuel those market share gains was the company's quick move into generative AI and its suite of AI-fueled digital assistants dubbed Copilot."", 'These moves increased demand for Azure. In its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended Dec. 31, the company noted that 6 percentage points of its cloud growth was the result of growing demand for AI services.', 'Microsoft is also more highly rated on Wall Street than Nvidia.

With Supermicro's expertise, customers can highly customize their server to meet any workload size or specialization, be it drug discovery, AI model training, or engineering simulations."", ""Because Supermicro is essentially one order down the value chain, it didn't see the benefits from growing AI demand until now. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ending Sept. 30, 2023), its revenue rose 14% year over year to $2.12 billion. But in Q2 (ending Dec. 31), its revenue rocketed 103% higher to $3.67 billion, confirming investors' suspicions that Super Micro Computer was slated for massive revenue growth due to AI demand."", ""Alongside that massive quarter was a huge bump to its annual revenue forecast. In Q1, management's fiscal 2024 revenue guidance was $10 billion to $11 billion. However, thanks to strong Q2 results and impressive demand, management raised its 2024 guidance, forecasting $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion."", ""This massive guidance increase excited many investors and ignited Super Micro Computer's run-up."", 'But is it worth buying at its current price, even with the pullback?', ""When a company rises that much, it's safe to assume the stock has gotten a bit expensive. While that's true, there's also another part to the story."", 'Supermicro entered the year trading around 13 times forward earnings. The market should have known great quarters were coming due to its industry, so the first 100% return was essentially getting Supermicro to where it should have been trading all along.', 'However, its current price tag of 45 times forward earnings seems a bit steep, especially when Nvidia is currently trading for 38 times forward earnings and has never traded for more than 51 times throughout the massive AI-fueled run-up.', 'Supermicro also has much more competition than Nvidia, as it faces companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM in the server business. In contrast, Nvidia essentially had the best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI.', ""As a result, I can't recommend Supermicro at this price. The company will likely continue to do well throughout this year, as it's slated to post strong growth thanks to server demand. But, the stock has already priced in massive success, making it difficult to grow meaningfully."", ""If you bought Super Micro Computer stock based on my Jan. 10 recommendation, congratulations -- you're up around 205%. But I think now is the time to take gains and move on, as there are plenty of other options in the market that will be easier to make money on."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett first used the term last year to refer to a group of stocks that are industry leading, each known for its strengths in some form of technology. These players, among the most heavily weighted in the S&P 500, have helped the benchmark soar into bull territory over the past year or so and could continue to drive gains thanks to their growth prospects.', 'These top stocks are: Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.', ""But there's one obvious element missing from this group: a healthcare company that's actually outperformed five of the Magnificent Seven stocks over the past year. And this player also now represents a bigger position in the S&P 500 than one of the Magnificent Seven stocks. Is this company on track to become the next Magnificent Seven company? Let's find out."", 'First, it\'s important to note that the Magnificent Seven isn\'t some sort of group or club that periodically welcomes new members. So, for Lilly to usher in the era of the ""Magnificent Eight"" or for a new stock to replace a current player in the Magnificent Seven, there aren\'t any official procedures to follow. The investment community as a whole would have to begin referring to this group as the ""Magnificent Eight"" – or clearly and broadly refer to one stock no longer making the cut in the Magnificent Seven and another taking over.', ""There's no guarantee any of that that will happen. But if it does, my prediction is healthcare giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) will enter this elite group of stocks. Lilly, gaining about 130% over the past year, has outperformed all of the Magnificent Seven except Meta and Nvidia -- they climbed more than 140% and 250%, respectively."", 'And Lilly has grown to become the eighth most heavily weighted stock in the S&P 500, surpassing Tesla, which has fallen to the No. 10 spot.', ""Why would Lilly make a great addition to the Magnificent Seven? Because the company's growth may beat even that of the group's best performer, Nvidia. Lilly is on track to deliver 50% growth annually over the coming five years -- that's higher than Nvidia's 35% annual growth estimate over the same period."", ""And driving Lilly's growth is a program with significant potential, the company's weight loss drug portfolio. The global weight loss drug market may reach $100 billion by 2030, growing 16 times from today's level, according to Goldman Sachs Research. And this forecast isn't surprising considering the trend Lilly and rival drugmaker Novo Nordisk have seen for their weight loss drugs: demand has surpassed supply, prompting both companies to ramp up manufacturing infrastructure."", 'Lilly makes two drugs -- Mounjaro and Zepbound -- that doctors have been prescribing for weight loss. The former officially was approved for type 2 diabetes, while the latter was approved specifically for weight management -- both are the same molecule, tirzepatide. It works by acting on two hormone pathways involved in digestion and has produced compelling results in clinical trials and in the real world. Lilly also is developing a third candidate, retatrutide, which may even outperform these current products because it acts on an additional hormone.', ""Lilly doesn't depend on its weight loss drug platform alone for earnings though. This big pharma player has a broad portfolio of products as well as a deep pipeline. But the weight loss program, which already is bringing in billions of dollars in revenue, could represent an enormous growth driver over the coming years -- making this healthcare player a growth stock that could easily claim a spot among the Magnificent Seven."", ""What does this mean for you as an investor? A potential spot in this group of stocks could buoy Lilly stock for a day or two, but inclusion in the Magnificent Seven or any other list isn't what makes Lilly a buy. Its growth potential does. Considering the demand for weight loss drugs today and most likely down the road too and Lilly's work on new candidates, prospects look bright. On top of this, Lilly's portfolio of other products also is driving earnings -- and the pipeline may ensure this growth will last."", 'Lilly today trades for 61x forward earnings estimates, which looks expensive for a pharma stock -- but this company is looking more like a growth stock, making this valuation look reasonable.', 'So, whether my prediction is right or not, Eli Lilly is a top growth stock to buy today and hold onto for the long term.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

Part of this turnaround has been a result of additional states legalizing sports betting, and the other part is the company's encouraging financials."", ""DraftKings' focus is on growth and wining market share, so profitability has taken a back seat. Even so, profitability seems to be within striking distance. In 2023's fourth quarter, the company made $1.23 billion in revenue, up 44% year over year, and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased by $201 million to $151 million."", ""This positive trend should continue for DraftKings as its number of users continues to grow. At the end of 2023, it had 7.1 million unique customers, which was 1.1 million more than at the end of 2023's first quarter. Its user base is growing fast and should help it maintain its market-leading position going forward."", 'Flutter Entertainment (LSE: FLTR) is the parent company of the popular sports betting platform FanDuel. FanDuel was the leader in online U.S. sports betting and iGaming until DraftKings took over the spot last year.', 'Flutter Entertainment holds a leadership position in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, and Italy markets, giving the company a wide net to continue its growth. Still, it relies heavily on FanDuel to keep a stronghold in the U.S., where it became structurally profitable as of the end of the first half of 2023. (It reports bi-annually instead of quarterly like traditional U.S. companies.)', ""FanDuel, in particular, had an adjusted EBITDA of $100 million in the first half of 2023. A growing customer base should keep its financials on the right track, but an underrated catalyst for future growth is the company's FanDuel Casino."", ""In the first half of 2023, FanDuel Casino's average monthly players grew 52% year over year, and its revenue grew 48%. Being able to cast a wide net in sports betting and online casino markets allows Flutter Entertainment to leverage its diverse portfolio for greater market penetration."", ""Sports betting is likely not the first thing that comes to mind when you think of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), but it's the parent company of ESPN, which recently released its own platform, ESPN BET. Launched in November 2023, ESPN BET is currently only available in 18 states, leaving plenty of room for the company to expand its presence."", 'As more sports betting platforms begin to pop up, the market will definitely get a bit crowded, but ESPN BET has a competitive advantage that none of the other platforms can compete with: the financial backing of Walt Disney and the reach of the ESPN network. There\'s a reason ESPN is called ""The Worldwide Leader in Sports,"" and you can bet (no pun intended) that the company will use its market position to its advantage.', ""Given how recently ESPN BET was released, there are no financials to measure it against, but if current ESPN success is any indication of what's possible, the company's choice to embrace sports betting should prove to be a good one. ESPN has been one of Walt Disney's best assets for a while, and ESPN BET and the growing sports betting market should help boost this effort."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in DraftKings right now?', 'Before you buy stock in DraftKings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DraftKings wasn’t one of them.

The stock is down over 10% year to date, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up over 9%.', ""It's difficult for such a heavily weighted stock to underperform the broader benchmarks by that much in a short time. But Apple is dealing with several very real challenges and has largely missed out on the tech rally that is being fueled by artificial intelligence (AI)."", ""As of March 22, Apple is now just 10.5% away from its 52-week low during a time when many other tech stocks are setting new all-time highs. Here's why Apple is about to get even closer to its 52-week low even if the stock stays where it is, and whether you should buy it\xa0now."", ""Apple's current 52-week low of $155.98 was reached on March 28, 2023. As the calendar rolls on, Apple's new 52-week low will get higher even if the stock price doesn't move. After May 4 (and assuming Apple doesn't go below this point), the new 52-week low will be $165.67 from Oct. 26, which is less than 5% below where Apple currently trades. By comparison, the stock's 52-week high of $199.62 occurred more recently, on Dec. 14, and it nearly exceeded that high just a couple of months ago in late January."", ""A stock's 52-week lows and highs are merely ranges, but they do signal if investors are optimistic or pessimistic. Apple is already closer to its recent low than its high, but it will get much closer to the low with time."", ""On a favorable note, it's worth mentioning how steady Apple has been. There is only a 20% swing from its 52-week high and the late-October low, meaning it has not been a volatile stock. Its 4.1% sell-off on March 21 was the largest single-session drop since Aug. 4. You would be hard-pressed to find a big tech stock that hasn't fallen more than 5% in a session in over a year."", 'As consistent as Apple has been, there are concerns that the investment thesis is weakening, setting the stage for further selling pressure. The company has a high success rate when it comes to hardware and accessories. But its current product pipeline is the most uncertain it has been in over a decade.', 'The company launched the iPad in January 2010. The Apple Watch, announced in September 2014, was initially met with skepticism but turned into a major hit. AirPods came out two years later in September 2016.', ""Aside from new versions of existing products, there hadn't been a significant new product until the Vision Pro was unveiled in June 2023 and made available in the U.S. on Feb. 2."", ""The company isn't in a new product and accessory drought, but the Vision Pro is unproven, and Apple simply hasn't come out with much else for a while now. Some of the uncertainty comes from within its existing ecosystem -- namely the iPhone."", ""New iPhone models feature improvements, but there hasn't been a massive leap for several years. Some hoped that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max would be a turning point, but that hasn't been the case thus far, as iPhone sales growth has ground to a halt."", ""Whether it's a lack of innovation or the fact that the upgrade cycle is getting longer, the product and accessory portfolio looks particularly vulnerable right now. That all could change in a heartbeat if the Vison Pro becomes a resounding success, Apple launches an AI-enabled iPhone that is welcomed by users, or a lot of folks who bought new products during the height of the pandemic decide to upgrade."", ""In sum, it's still too early to sound the alarm on Apple's innovation glut, but there are cracks that are beginning to form."", ""Trailing diluted earnings per share (EPS) are up just 4.2% over the last two years. And judging by analyst estimates, the growth isn't going to return in the short term."", 'Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 26.8, and its forward P/E is 26.3. Apple reported its 2024 first-quarter earnings for the period ended Dec. 30, 2023. Average analyst EPS estimates for the full fiscal year are $6.56.', ""Growth is expected to tick up in fiscal 2025, with average earnings estimates of $7.16 per share, 9% higher than fiscal 2024. But those results won't fully materialize until Apple reports its 2025 full-fiscal-year results in February 2026 -- a long time to wait."", 'Single-digit EPS growth is a negative outlook for Apple, especially because a few percentage points are due to buybacks. So, taking that out, forecasts are really only calling for net income growth in the mid-single digits in fiscal 2025, which would imply little improvement in product sales and next to no growth from the Vision Pro.', ""And these forecasts don't even factor in the risks from the recently announced lawsuit against Apple by the Department of Justice. The suit targets the company's services more than its products and could compress margins for what has been a bright spot in an otherwise cloudy period."", 'When an excellent industry leader with an impeccable brand faces negative sentiment, a gloomy outlook, and other challenges, it is usually a good buying opportunity even if the stock goes down more in the short term. There are countless examples of this dynamic playing out across multiple industries.', ""Big tech stocks got clobbered in 2022 and staged an epic recovery in 2023. This year, the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average isn't Salesforce or Amazon or Microsoft -- it's Walt Disney,\xa0which had underperformed the market for multiple years but is up 28% in less than three months."", 'With challenges compounding, I expect Apple to break to a new 52-week low, especially once the margin narrows between its current price and the new higher one-year low after March 28. But the more Apple falls, the better value it will become for long-term investors.', 'The stock is worth buying now, but investors should closely monitor the performance of the Vision Pro and watch for updates at its Worldwide Developers Conference (usually early June) and its annual Apple Event (usually early to mid-September).', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.', 'What is Brian Roberts going to do?', 'The Comcast boss is watching an unceasing five-alarm fire rage at 30 Rock, scarring the reputation of NBC News and threatening to consume multiple parts of the Cesar Conde-run NBC Universal News Group.', 'It’s difficult to succinctly summarize the disastrous state of affairs at the news division, given that multiple engines are failing simultaneously. But one thing is clear: Conde has lost control of his organization, prompting industry insiders to wonder how he continues to remain in his role as chairman of the NBC News Group. In the words of one veteran media executive I spoke to Wednesday, “It’s inconceivable that he should.”', 'Instead of extinguishing the inferno that broke out on Friday with the hiring of former Republican National committee chair Ronna McDaniel, sparking an unprecedented on-air mutiny over her role in working to subvert the 2020 vote, the actions of Conde and the NBC executives he has empowered have only hosed gasoline on it.', 'While it was immediately obvious that the announcement was not going over well with the network’s staff, Conde froze still, digging his heels in the (Miami?) sand and refusing to dump McDaniel until after his top television personalities, including Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow, went on the air and excoriated the hire. By the time Conde moved to sever ties with McDaniel on Tuesday evening, however, the crisis had spiraled far out of control and given way to even larger problems for the network boss.', 'The eventual decision to cut McDaniel earned him public praise from MSNBC hosts, but not before the 80-hour saga severely tarnished the reputations of Conde’s top executives and touched off an all-out civil war inside the news group which has sent the organization into a tailspin.', 'Those details are starting to leak flood out of 30 Rock and into public view. On Wednesday evening, Puck’s Dylan Byers offered an inside look into the chaos that has broken out — and it’s quite an ugly sight to behold.', 'Byers reported that Carrie Budoff Brown, NBC News’ senior vice president of politics, had recruited Republican Richard Walters to “advance conservative pushback on social media against Todd.” Brown denied that characterization but told Byers that she “had a conversation with Richard Walters and asked if [McDaniel] had supporters who could speak on behalf of her being an NBC News contributor,” but insisted that she “never discussed what to say, how to say it, or who to focus on.” Regardless, staffers inside NBC News are enraged at the fact an executive would have engaged in such behavior.', 'Inside Conde’s inner circle, Stephen Labaton, executive vice president of communications, is also facing an accusation of professional misconduct. Amid the crisis, Labaton bashed his colleagues over at MSNBC, rebuking the hosts in a profane manner, Byers reported, citing a source. Labaton denied making the remark and suggested a disgruntled McDaniel had alleged it after being fired.', 'Over at MSNBC, Rashida Jones, the network chief, did not escape unscathed. Byers reported that not only did Jones initially not object to McDaniel’s hiring, but that she expressed interest in having the election denier on the progressive cable network.', 'And, outside of Byers’ report, I am told that staffers are not pleased with Rebecca Blumenstein, the NBC News president of editorial. During the network’s daily editorial meetings this week, Blumenstein has managed to remain almost entirely silent on the McDaniel mess, drawing consternation and dismay from staffers. That could, however, change on Thursday. Blumenstein, I’m told, will travel to Washington to meet with staffers.', 'Meanwhile, as the top executives at NBCU News Group are ensnared in their own controversies, the company is under tremendous attack from right-wing figures, which are aiming to mar the reputation of NBC News.', '“NBC just hired & immediately fired Ronna McDaniel, because the team refused to let even one Republican join them – that’s how biased they are!” Elon Musk posted on his social platform X Wednesday.', 'Of course, the reality is that the journalists rejected McDaniel because she participated in Donald Trump’s attempt to throw out votes in 2020 and in the years since publicly stated she did not believe Biden legitimately won the election. Nevertheless, the dishonest narrative is what outlets like Fox News are feeding their audiences — and that coverage has significant consequences for NBC News. Ironically, NBC News’ attempt to make inroads with Republicans through the hiring of McDaniel has had the opposite effect.', 'By the time the right-wing media machine is through with NBC News, it will likely be one of the least trusted news organizations on the right. Instead of taking a few steps forward, the outlet has been sent a dozen steps back. The right is still animated by the Tom Cotton op-ed controversy that roiled The New York Times in 2020. That drama now appears relatively minor when compared to the seismic event that McDaniel’s ouster has wrought.', 'And it is likely not over. Staffers inside the company are wondering amongst themselves who is going to be held accountable for the mess. Will any executives lose their jobs over the corporate catastrophe? That conversation is playing out as McDaniel hunts for an attorney as she prepares for a possible legal fight with NBC News over its decision to pull the plug on her contract and, potentially, the embarrassment the entire episode has caused.', 'The right-wing fury has also reached the door of Roberts. On Wednesday, Trump spent part of the day ranting on Truth Social against the Comcast boss over the McDaniel disaster, characterizing Roberts as a weak leader whose employees are running amok.', '“The sick degenerates over at MSDNC are really running NBC, and there seems nothing Chairman Brian Roberts can do about it,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. He later added: “MSNDC fake anchors have taken over NBC from Chairman Brian Roberts, and he doesn’t know what to do!”', 'It’s not the first time that Roberts has bore the brunt of Trump’s ire. In November, Trump wrote that the government “should come down hard” on Comcast and “make them pay” for the editorial positions of MSNBC. Given that Roberts and the executives who run the media conglomerate hold a significant distaste for drama, it’s difficult to imagine that he is thrilled to once again find himself in the former president’s crosshairs — and all because of Conde’s self-inflicted wounds.', 'Put another way: The fire in the NBCU News Group house has spread to the Comcast neighborhood – and that can’t bode well for Conde, who I’m told had been remote-working during the crisis. (I asked Conde’s spokesperson on Wednesday whether the network boss had returned to 30 Rock to manage the situation in-person, but did not hear back.)', 'While Conde struggles to quell the internal fighting, it is unclear what precisely Roberts and Comcast president Michael Cavanagh are doing — or will do — to help put out the flames. I asked Comcast spokespeople on Wednesday if either Roberts or Cavanagh were taking any action. Do they have confidence in Conde’s ability to lead, given that his portfolio has been thrown into absolute disarray?', 'Comcast declined to comment. Suffice to say, that silence is rather deafening.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

During this period, the Zacks Cable Television industry, which Comcast falls in, has lost 1.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'Comcast is expected to post earnings of $0.99 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7%.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $4.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Comcast is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Comcast, the consensus sales estimate of $29.9 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The $124.61 billion and $124.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.5% and +0.2%, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Comcast reported revenues of $31.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $0.84 for the same period compares with $0.82 a year ago.', 'Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.77%. The EPS surprise was +5%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.', 'Valuation', ""Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Comcast is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

But the California bump for fast-food workers is unusual for targeting a specific business sector and adjusting the minimum rate by so much at once.', '“This is such a dramatic increase on a state minimum wage that was already quite high,” said Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University public policy professor and the Labor Department’s chief economist in the Clinton administration. “The workers who keep their jobs will be happy — they will be better off.”', 'Less so for consumers of fast food, who will undoubtedly pay more for their burgers, tacos and fried chicken. David Neumark, a minimum-wage expert at UC Irvine, estimated that overall prices will rise between 2.5% and 3.75%.', 'Read more: California fast-food workers form an unusual union in a bid for higher wages, better working conditions', 'That’s relatively small, but comes on top of the steep inflation that customers have faced at fast-food establishments in the last few years. Nationally, prices at limited-service restaurants are up almost 30% from February 2020 levels, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And more fast-food price increases will hit lower-income households harder because they spend a larger share of their income on food and consume disproportionately more fast food.', 'A spokesperson for McDonald’s said the company was exploring several ways to counterbalance the increase in labor costs and has yet to decide how much it will raise the price of menu items at its corporate-owned stores. At franchise locations, which account for 95% of the brand\'s U.S. portfolio, McDonald’s provides “informed pricing recommendations"" but final pricing is at the discretion of franchisees, the spokesperson said.', 'Starbucks said it had elected to raise the pay floor for all levels of employees in California to retain workers and to combat wage compression — when there is little difference in pay between experienced workers and entry-level ones. It plans to offset the increased labor expenditure “through a variety of levers — including near-term pricing as well as other efficiencies,” a spokesperson said.', 'The economic effects of such a sharp and sudden pay hike are unclear. In general, raising the minimum wage helps large swaths of low-wage workers, bringing some out of poverty, but others will lose out as employers scale back through layoffs, shorter shifts, reduced hiring and other cost-saving measures.', '“Where they can automate, they will automate more,” Holzer said. “Maybe some franchises will move out of state.”', 'The COVID-19 pandemic has already spurred more fast-food operators to install self-service ordering kiosks, and the industry is looking at other ways to depend less on human labor, including the use of robots.', 'Proponents of the new law say fast-food corporations can afford to pay up. The industry has flourished since the pandemic began as customers sought cheap and quick meals, leading to billions in sales and record profits.', 'But the brands say they, too, have had to contend with high inflation for ingredients and supplies and have already raised wages for their workers without government prompting. Between 2019 and 2022, the average weekly wage for employees at limited-service restaurants jumped 26% to $501.', 'Franchise owners in particular are anxious about their ability to shoulder the extra costs; labor accounts for roughly a third of a typical fast-food operator’s expenses.', 'Shortly after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the pay increase legislation into law in September, hundreds of Pizza Hut franchises in California moved to lay off more than 1,100 delivery drivers, federal and state filings show.', 'The affected Pizza Huts are run by franchise operators and located from Orange to Stanislaus counties, according to the California Employment Development Department. The layoffs were expected to go into effect in February.', 'Fast food is tightly woven into the history, cultural life and economic growth of Southern California.', 'Brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald opened a drive-in restaurant in Pasadena in 1937, a few years before starting the first McDonald’s in San Bernardino. Another pioneer, Carl Karcher, bought a hot dog cart in L.A. in 1941 and went on to found Carl’s Jr.', 'Taco Bell, In-N-Out Burger and Jack in the Box also come from the region.', 'Collectively, their explosive growth across the U.S. and sustained success over the decades symbolized the busy American life, the rise of the baby boomer generation and California’s love affair with cars.', 'Yet the industry has come to be seen as the stereotypical low-wage sector where millions of workers make minimum wage and toil under tough and sometimes unsafe conditions, making it a prime subject of the Fight for $15 movement and such books as “Fast Food Nation.”', 'The passage of AB 1228 represented a significant win for fast-food workers who for years have organized for better wages and protections. Along with the higher minimum, the new law established a Fast Food Council — composed of business and labor representatives — that has the authority to set future pay increases (at a maximum of 3.5% a year) and develop standards on working conditions and employee safety and training.', 'Employees at fast-food or limited-service restaurants nationwide work about 25 hours a week on average. Many face unpredictable hours with some called in on short notice or required to work split shifts — two separate periods in one day.', 'Angelica Hernandez, who works as a cook trainer at a McDonald’s in Monterey Park and was appointed to the Fast Food Council, called the $20 minimum wage “good progress.” But she worries that the restaurant will respond by slashing employee hours, which she said it has done in the past after increasing wages.', '“They’re utilizing one person to do the job of two, three or four people,” she said.', 'Earlier this year, workers formed the California Fast Food Workers Union, which is part of the Service Employees International Union, to bargain with the council. The union has said it plans to push for annual wage increases, predictable schedules and just-cause protections.', 'Workers can expect to maintain some leverage in future negotiations as growth slows. There is still tight competition for fast-food workers, though not as stiff as at the height of the Great Resignation in 2021-22, when many people quit their jobs and rethought their work and life priorities after COVID-19.', 'A guaranteed $20 an hour could lure people on the sidelines into the fast-food job market, including teenagers who once dominated the fast-food workforce, economists said.', 'Over the years, the average age of fast-food workers in the U.S. has been rising gradually as many teens have instead sought enrichment jobs to prepare for college. The median age for fast-food workers is now 22.1, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.', 'Zev Brown, a senior at Eagle Rock High School, has worked government jobs and on political campaigns since his sophomore year, earning $18 to $25 an hour.', 'Although he knows classmates who have jobs at Starbucks, McDonald’s and Burger King, he said most of his friends prefer to work for local mom-and-pop businesses or start their own money-making ventures.', '“People want to work in the neighborhood they call home and the neighborhood in which they go to school,” Brown said. “Side-hustle culture and entrepreneurial culture are really big.”', 'That said, $20 an hour makes a fast-food job “more enticing for a student,” said his friend, 17-year-old Sawyer Sariñana, who has been making money through photography work.', '“I would definitely consider it now — I think that’s a big jump and makes a big difference,” said Sariñana, also a senior at Eagle Rock High School.', ""Read more: It's been the year of the worker. West Hollywood employers are so over it"", 'Fast-food locations in grocery stores, airports, hotels, theme parks, sports venues and other businesses are exempt from the minimum-wage increase, as are employers that operate a bakery on the premises — a loophole that has raised questions about whether Panera Bread and others like it must comply.', 'At first, it might seem that restaurant employers not covered by the mandate now have an advantage: As the big fast-food chains lay off or hire fewer staff, that could expand the pool of available workers — who could be paid less than $20 an hour. But owners of independent fast-casual and full-service restaurants aren’t sure that will be the case, and anticipate having to raise wages to keep pace.', '“Every bump in the restaurant labor market raises the prices for everyone, period.

Citrin closed Charcoal Sunset in February.', '“At a point, you can’t trim anymore,” he said. “When I closed at the end, there was no more money to operate.”', 'Seattle, one of the first in the national Fight for $15 campaign, lifted its minimum wage from $9.47 an hour in April 2015 to $13 in January 2016 — a 37% jump over a nine-month period.', 'Researchers at the University of Washington found that businesses overwhelmingly survived, said Jacob Vigdor, a University of Washington public policy professor who directed the minimum-wage study.', 'But overall employment at eating and drinking establishments in Seattle grew at a notably slower pace after 2016, and there was another downside: Employees saw fewer hours of work — on average by about 10%.', 'In 2017, Seattle made it more costly for restaurant and retail employers to send workers home early and make other scheduling changes.

Up to 200 facilities are slated for closure over a five-year period.', 'The optimization plan, code-named Network of the Future, is expected to save $3 billion per year by 2028 through better productivity, according to a new strategic framework outlined by management on Tuesday. The leadership team explained why it is targeting premium segments such as health care and small businesses, as well as nearshoring trends, as big opportunities.', 'The event for investors was held in a massive new aircraft hangar at the delivery giant’s global air hub in Louisville, Kentucky, and streamed on the web.', 'UPS (NYSE: UPS) declared financial targets for 2026 include revenue of $108 billion to $114 billion — up from $91 billion last year — an adjusted operating margin above 13%, free cash flow of about $17.5 billion and capital spending of about 5.5% of total revenue.', '', 'Wall Street, which wanted $3 billion in reduced costs by 2026 instead of 2028, didn’t seem impressed. The company previously warned that operating profit would be down 20% to 30% year over year in the first half and then rebound to be up by the same amount in the second half as the wage growth rate from the new Teamster contract eases. UPS’ share price fell 8% by Tuesday’s close, but recovered some ground on Wednesday.', 'The growth and productivity plan also will be boosted from the return of growth to the small package market, said Matt Guffey, chief commercial and strategy officer. The U.S. small package market was expected to grow from 74 million average daily packages to 108 million by 2023, but the COVID demand spike reverted, inflation increased and the industry only reached 84 million packages per day.', 'UPS estimates modest growth in 2024 to 88 million packages, rising to a daily volume of 98 million in two years, on a compound annual growth rate of 5.5%. International small package growth will be nearly flat this year but grow at a 3.5% annual rate to 30 million units in 2026.', 'Analysts said UPS’s revenue guidance for 11% growth in 2025 and 2026 is optimistic given average revenue growth of 5% to 10% in the 10 years prior to the pandemic and Amazon’s increasing capture of market share. They also questioned the need for mergers and acquisitions to reach the targets. BMO Capital Markets analyst Fadi Chamoun said UPS assumes it can make significant market share gains in premium market segments by leveraging its integrated network, which will be difficult to fully execute. He said a more realistic revenue target is $104 billion.', '', 'Also acting as a potential revenue drag is a capacity surplus equivalent to average daily volume of 12 million packages across the industry after e-commerce and delivery companies ramped up infrastructure to meet shelter-at-home demand during the pandemic. The company is doing its part to bring supply into equilibrium by closing 70 conventional sorting facilities in 2023 and 2024 and flowing more volume into automated facilities, said Nando Cesarone, president U.S. operations. By 2028, UPS will close 200 facilities and consolidate operations in high-capacity spaces.', 'The UPS forecast assumes that competitors such as Amazon,the U.S. Postal Service and regional parcel companies won’t add more capacity, said Ravi Shanker at Morgan Stanley. It should be noted, however, that Amazon has cut back on planned fulfillment centers and the USPS is streamlining its network too.', 'Warehouses outfitted with smart package technologies — such as autonomous guided vehicles, automated sorting systems, and systems that can prioritize processing for specific customer requirements without manual intervention — experience a 30% to 35% bump in effective handling capacity.', 'Atlanta-based UPS has 63 automation projects targeted between now and 2028 that will more than triple the number of buildings with automation to 400. In the U.S., the vast majority of the automation projects will be completed in existing buildings. Ten of those automation projects are new builds. Overall, UPS is investing $9 billion in network upgrades.', '“Every single work area is being scrutinized for automation opportunities, not just our sortation hubs,” said Cesarone. Technologies being introduced include automated address correction and delivery redirection, automated dispatch for package car drivers and feeder operations, and affixing pre-load assist labels to packages. Automated loading and unloading of trailers is being pilot tested.', 'In Worcester, Massachusetts, UPS is replacing a facility built in 1969 with a larger one that will allow work from four regional facilities to be consolidated in one place, reduce network touches and improve utilization. Another example of network simplification is in Albany, New York, where the integrator is modernizing a facility to increase capacity, which will allow it to close another site.', 'In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, UPS has closed 15 sort centers and reduced staffing, resulting in 60,000 fewer packages being physically handled per day. The less a parcel is dumped out, shuttled through a conveyor system and swept into bins, the less chance of damage. Together, area savings amount to $80 million.', 'UPS recently notified the state of Oregon it will close a package terminal in Portland and lay off 331 workers in mid-April because it wasn’t busy enough, according to the Portland Business Journal.', '', 'The Network of the Future bears similarities to FedEx’s network transformation called Network 2.0. FedEx, however, is delivering more tangible cost reductions in part because it needed greater changes to satisfy investor calls for better profitability. FedEx traditionally operated three distinct networks — Express, Ground and Freight — that weren’t very interoperable, and it has an airline more than twice the size of UPS’ fleet.', 'UPS is much more than a parcel delivery company. On the logistics side, management said it aims for a 40% volume mix from small businesses and is building more digital tools to help them easily manage international shipments from end to end. And it plans to double revenue in health care logistics to $20 billion through organic growth and acquisitions by 2026.', 'Kate Gutmann, president of international, health care and supply chain solutions, said UPS is heavily investing in health care logistics, a market estimated to reach $152 billion in 2026 from $130 billion today, because an aging global population needs more drugs and biological medical products to deal with chronic disease.', '“The health care logistics market is especially attractive to us, because it has year-round demand and is more resistant to economic downturns. That enables more predictability for operations across the whole supply chain. The majority of our health care customers buy more services across our end-to-end supply chain than customers in any other segment.

The good news for shareholders is that tailwinds are swirling for increased spending over the long term. The power dynamic in the economy is shifting from older generations to millennial and Gen Z consumers. American Express reported that over 60% of new card and 75% of gold and platinum card signups came from these demographics in 2023.', ""Understand these young consumers to gain insight into their spending habits. Housing is costly, and fewer young consumers are buying homes. The average homebuyer's age has increased to 35 for first-time buyers from roughly 30 a decade ago. Some young people are opting to rent. Additionally, living costs have inflated in recent years."", 'According to a consumer survey by PYMNTS and Elan Financial Services, 43% of millennials and Gen Z reported increasing credit card usage. The survey concluded that these young consumers use credit 30% more than the average cardholder.', 'American Express holds its loans, which makes default the greatest threat to the business. Despite household credit card debt at record levels, American Express is experiencing no problems here. Late-paying customers and write-offs are below pre-pandemic levels, a healthy sign that customers are paying their bills.', 'Problems arise if these numbers rise too much, but they reflect a high-quality user base. American Express is a premium card company that caters to many business accounts and prime borrowers. This potentially insulates American Express from defaults more than companies serving subprime borrowers.', ""Analysts have been encouraged by American Express' performance, gradually raising long-term earnings growth estimates since January to over 13.5% today. The stock's valuation has also climbed with the share price, which has risen to nearly 18 times earnings from a price-to-earnings ratio of 14 just a few months ago."", ""The stock looks attractively valued in two different ways. First, American Express is expected to grow faster than the broader market's historical average, around 10% annually. Yet, the stock's valuation trails the S&P 500's, currently at a P/E of 21. In other words, American Express is growing faster, but the stock is less expensive. That could be due to the business model's default risk, but remember, default metrics are healthy."", ""Secondly, I use the PEG ratio to gauge what I pay for a company's earnings growth. I like to buy long-term stocks with PEG ratios of 1.5 or less (lower is better), and American Express' PEG ratio of 1.3 fits that criterion."", ""Ultimately, American Express seems poised to benefit from increased spending by young consumers.

Here's what you need to know about the acquisition and Capital One's business before buying it today."", 'Capital One provides banking to customers, but its bread-and-butter business is credit cards. According to The Nilson Report, a newsletter covering the global payment industry, Capital One is the fourth-largest credit card company in the U.S. Only JPMorgan Chase, American Express, and Citigroup issued more credit cards.', 'Capital One works with payment processors, such as Visa and Mastercard, to provide debit and credit cards to customers. The company then earns processing and interchange fees for authorizing and providing settlement on all card transactions processed through those payment networks.', ""Last year, interchange fees accounted for $4.8 billion of its $36.8 billion in revenue. Net interest income, or the interest earned on credit cards and other loans minus interest paid out on its liabilities, makes up the bulk of Capital One's revenue, accounting for $29.2 billion last year."", ""Capital One's agreement to buy Discover Financial Services in a $35 billion all-stock deal attracted a lot of attention, including from regulators -- and for good reason. If the deal goes through, Capital One could become the largest credit card lender in the U.S."", ""Capital One's acquisition would give it Discover's payment network, including Discover Network, Diners Club, and Pulse debit network, which compete with Visa and Mastercard for processing payments. Capital One could move its cards to Discover's network and create a closed-loop payment network to save money and better compete with Visa and Mastercard if the deal goes through."", 'A Capital One-Discover combination could be a big win for shareholders, but the deal will be heavily scrutinized by consumer groups and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle before being approved.', 'Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said that the merger ""threatens our financial stability, reduces competition, and would increase fees and credit costs for American families"" and asked regulators to ""block it immediately.""

Today, Capital One stock is priced at 1.25 times tangible book value after being priced at a 10% discount to book value at several points last year."", ""The bank's acquisition of Discover will make it a compelling investing opportunity, but it still has several hoops to jump through and the transaction likely won't be approved until late this year or 2025 -- if it gets approved at all."", 'Near-term consumer headwinds and the recent rapid increase in its stock price make Capital One a stock that investors should avoid for now.

Walmart alleged Capital One repeatedly failed to meet several contractual obligations of the card partnership, including promptly issuing replacement cards to customers, and processing their payments and posting transactions to their accounts in a timely manner.', 'The terms of the 2018 credit card issuing agreement between the retailer and the lender laid out a number of customer service benchmarks Capital One was required to meet.

(NASDAQ:ULTA), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$11b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Ulta Beauty surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$26.03 per share, modestly greater than expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty ', ""Following the latest results, Ulta Beauty's 29 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$11.8b in 2025. This would be an okay 4.9% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be US$26.78, roughly flat on the last 12 months. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$11.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$26.79 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", 'The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$582, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Ulta Beauty analyst has a price target of US$690 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$387. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.', ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Ulta Beauty's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that Ulta Beauty's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 12% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this to the 149 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.0% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while Ulta Beauty's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's expected to grow roughly in line with the industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for Ulta Beauty going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here."", 'It is also worth noting that we have found 1 warning sign for Ulta Beauty that you need to take into consideration.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Barber and Boychuk, Norfolk Southern can reduce its operating ratio to the low 60s within 12 months,” Ancora argued in the Tuesday shareholder letter. “Assuming they are successful, Norfolk Southern will then be able to achieve a significantly higher valuation and start delivering higher-margin volume based on consistently stronger service and new leadership’s relationships with a broader spectrum of domestic and international shippers.”', 'Later that day, Norfolk Southern sent out a letter of its own to shareholders once again throwing support behind its 13 “highly qualified and experienced” director nominees.', '“It is this cohort of extremely talented and experienced directors that Ancora would have shareholders dismantle and replace with inferior nominees who the board has determined lack the necessary qualifications to serve on the board,” said the letter. “They are being put forward solely as part of Ancora’s campaign to remove management and take control of the board to implement Ancora’s ill-conceived and reckless strategy.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth.

Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuit as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.015. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Under the Internal Revenue Code Section 162 (l), taxpayers can deduct premiums paid for themselves, their spouse, and their dependents on the tax return.

These rate lists are based on different locations and can be checked on the official website of the US General Services Administration.', 'The meal expenses cannot be deducted in the absence of an employer or employees.

The first is the regular method, which requires the business owners to calculate the home office expense deduction by dividing the total expense into business and personal use. Direct business expenses can be deducted in total, while indirect costs can be allocated to the portion of the home space used for business. For instance, qualified daycare business owners might not use their homes exclusively for business. However, they must determine the business use percentage based on their business hours. Business owners can compute the deduction using Form 8829 and file for the tax deduction on Schedule C, Form 1040.', 'The other method is the simplified method, which allows taxpayers to calculate the deduction for business use of the home using a specified rate of $5 per square foot of the portion in business. Using this method, taxpayers can deduct the home office expenses directly on Schedule C instead of Form 8829. Despite the method used to calculate the deduction, taxpayers cannot deduct expenses that exceed the gross income limitation.', 'Among other tax deductions, small businesses can also write off salaries, bonuses, commissions, and non-cash compensation paid to full-time or part-time employees.

To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy industry, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.', 'Although renewable energy has been a trending topic for the last few years, the industry still has a long way to go. At the COP 28 conference in December 2023, it was recognized that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut down by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, if we are to keep global warming below 1.5°C.\xa0', 'While 2022 was the year of fossil fuels due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the industry didn’t perform well the next year. Oil and gas prices normalized during 2023, and the super majors’ profits took a tumble. The energy sector saw investments worth $2.8 trillion, and 60% of the investments were directed toward renewable energy in 2023. For the oil and gas sector analysis, you can go to 13 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside.', 'According to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the United States saw the deployment of $303.3 billion in financing for clean energy technologies as part of its transition toward sustainable energy in 2023. In the year, 42 gigawatts (GW) of additional renewable power generation capacity was added to the U.S. grid. Tax rebates and other incentives have been the driving force behind the rise in renewables. Since the announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, the number of planned renewable energy manufacturing facilities has risen to 104, compared to 9 in August 2022.', ""Despite record-breaking investments, the renewable energy industry did not perform well in 2023, and related stocks declined significantly compared to the broader market. The most in-demand segment in renewable energy was solar, yet Global X Solar ETF (RAYS) and Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) performed poorly, showing declines of over 35% and nearly 27% in 2023, respectively. On top of that, the security and protection company ADT Inc. (NYSE:ADT), which was also involved in the residential solar business, announced its exit from the industry in January due to facing challenges caused by worsening conditions in the sector influenced by broader economic factors. At the company's Q4, 2023 earnings call, ADT Inc.'s (NYSE:ADT) interim CFO and president of corporate development and chief transformation officer, Jeffrey Likosar said:"", '""The Solar segment generated $50 million of revenue and a $28 million adjusted EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter. For the year, Solar\'s adjusted EBITDA loss was $117 million on $330 million of revenue. We had previously written off all solar goodwill and impaired certain other assets in connection with our partial shutdown in 2023. As announced in January, and as Jim mentioned, we are now winding down operations altogether. As we refocused our business during the past year, we continued strong cash generation in CSB. Total company adjusted free cash flow, including interest rate swaps, was $525 million for the full year. This was down slightly versus 2022 driven by solar performance and higher net interest expense offsetting the CSB progress.""', 'High interest rates and labor wages leading to high costs have been the primary hurdles in the growth of the sector. However, on March 20, the Fed seemed to be firm on its decision of three rate cuts this year and kept the interest rates steady. Furthermore, compared to the fossil fuel industry, the renewables segment is still in its infancy and is expected to grow at a fast pace. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global renewable energy market was estimated at $1.02 trillion in 2023 and will reach $1.55 trillion by 2028. The industry is expected to register a nearly 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during the forecasted period.', 'Despite the growth prospects of the renewable energy industry, there are still some hurdles that it is facing. The latest one is ""Basel III: Endgame"", which was proposed in July 2023, as reported by Reuters. The Basel III framework was introduced in response to the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009, providing capital and liquidity standards for the global banking system. It requires banks to keep a certain amount of money on the side as a safety net when they invest in equities or projects to cover potential losses and maintain stability. Currently, investments like renewable energy and a few others are considered to carry a 100% risk unless they make up more than 10% of a bank’s capital, which means that the banks have to set aside one dollar for every dollar invested. If they exceed 10%, the risk weighting increases to 400%. The new regulations (Basel III: Endgame) proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) seek to remove this 10% threshold and aim to keep risk weighting to 400% for all investments. These proposed changes could negatively affect the investments made in the renewables industry.', 'Nevertheless, NorthStar Asset Management\'s CIO and senior portfolio manager, Nimrit Kang, is quite bullish on the renewable energy sector in the long term. In an interview with CNBC posted on March 6, she said that the market has performed well recently and is ""due for a pause"" in the near term, but looking forward 5 to 10 years, the market trajectory is still ""upward"". She further added that a lot of money could be made from the clean energy sector. One stock that Kang recommends is Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) due to its operations in electrical infrastructure and also its products being used in data centers amid the recent AI revolution.', ""At NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:NEE) Q4 2023 earnings call, Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research raised the question of the sustainability of the IRA in case election results are in favor of the Republicans. The CEO of the company, John Ketchum, replied that it was highly unlikely that the IRA would be affected negatively. He said:"", '“...in the 21 years I’ve been at the company, as we’ve changed administrations and we’ve seen changes in Congress, we’ve never seen a change or appeal of tax credits. No matter what form they’ve taken, IRA is the form we’re talking about here. So that’s the first point I would make. Second, it’s really hard to overturn existing law. I think Obamacare is a very good example of that. It’s just very difficult no matter what the political wins are. The third point I would make is that the IRA benefits both sides of the aisle. It certainly is advantageous for obvious reasons for Democrats, but it also has a big benefit to Republicans. Because if you think about where the investments are being made around IRA and where a lot of the benefit of IRA is flowing, it’s flowing to Republican states and it’s flowing to parts of those states that are really difficult to stimulate economically. And we’re talking about rural communities in these states. And so when we come in and we build a wind project, we build a solar project, we build a battery storage project, it’s a complete turnaround for these communities. We’re providing an economic base in the form of jobs. We’re providing an economic base in the form of spending that occurs in that community. We’re providing an economic base in the form of property taxes and sales tax revenues. These are 180s for these rural communities and make a huge difference on their viability going forward.”', 'In light of the above-mentioned data, some of the most undervalued renewable energy stocks according to analysts, include Ameresco, Inc.

(NYSE:NEE). Over the past few years, the company developed into a growth darling thanks to its strong track record in renewable energy development and tailwinds from the global energy transition and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act. The problem for NextEra, and the transition broadly, is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital. This requires high capital expenditures – often resulting in negative free cash flow – to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra. To help, the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners, providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans. NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically. Ultimately, the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions, driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

That run looks likely to continue with the spinoff of GE Vernova, set for April 2. That\'s the view of Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Akers, who recently upgraded GE\'s price target from $177 to $200. Akers maintained an ""overweight"" rating on the stock.', ""In Akers's view, GE has the potential to cut costs significantly in the coming years thanks to the spinoff, which should result in higher margins down the line. As a smaller company, there's an obvious opportunity to cut down on corporate costs, and its GE Aerospace segment is set to move into a cash-flow generative space as revenue from servicing LEAP engines starts to kick in."", 'In addition, Akers believes GE Vernova is worth around $34 per GE share, a relatively high estimate compared to other Wall Street analysts.', 'The excellent news is that Akers\'s GE Vernova estimate is close to the mark. Whole GE Vernova hasn\'t begun ""regular way"" trading yet, but it began trading on a ""when issued"" basis under the ticker ""GEV WI"" on March 27.', ""At the time of writing, it's trading at $133, and since GE stockholders will get one GE Vernova share for every four shares they hold in GE, the price equates to $33.25 per GE share, close to Akers's target."", 'On the other hand, the GE stock that is trading without the right to receive GE Vernova stock (under the ticker ""GE WI"") is trading at about $145 at the time of writing. As such, GE Aerospace (what the remaining company will be called) isn\'t quite at the level Akers envisages.

It’s on the minds of many of the business world’s heavy hitters as the realization sets in that the developed world is not having enough children. Last summer, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called declining birth rates “the biggest danger civilization faces by far” in a post on X.com, arguing that the dynamic is creating an “underpopulation crisis” that will have far-reaching consequences. And just this week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned in his annual letter to shareholders that with populations aging in many nations worldwide, and workers retiring at younger ages, a “retirement crisis” is brewing that could stress social safety nets.', 'To their point, Americans are getting older, fast. In 1970, less than 10% of the U.S. population was over the age of 65. This year, that figure is sitting at roughly 18%, meaning a record percentage of Americans have hit retirement age. What’s more, says one of Wall Street’s top investment banks, it’s just going to get worse.', 'In a new report titled “Longevity in the U.S.: Trends and Investment Opportunities,” a team of Morgan Stanley economists and analysts said they believe the share of Americans older than 65 will hit 24% by 2060.', 'That’s not great news, considering aging populations tend to weigh on economic growth, decrease worker productivity, and burden government budgets, according to IMF research from well before the pandemic, in 2017. Economists for the Bank of International Settlements saw the negative impact of aging populations coming even earlier, in 2015—offering an advanced and unorthodox theory of how it would affect inflation (sending it higher than at any time since the 1970s, exactly what happened in 2022).', 'But there are opportunities in everything, even an aging world, as Morgan Stanley found. The bank’s analysts noted that as the U.S. population ages, the spending decisions of Americans over the age of 65—whose average net worth has soared in recent years—will become increasingly important. They added that investors who pay attention to these seniors’ spending habits may be able to secure a profit by buying a few key stocks.', 'As one would expect, the 65-plus demographic spends far less on transportation, apparel, and education services than other generations, but far more on health care and housing. Morgan Stanley’s analysts argued that senior housing and at-home health care companies should benefit from these spending trends as seniors make up a larger and larger portion of the population.', 'UnitedHealth Group, the health insurance and services behemoth which took the No. 10 spot on the Fortune Global 500 in 2023 and boasts a market cap of over $450 billion, is a top pick for Morgan Stanley for a few key reasons.', 'First, the U.S.’s aging population is “driving record demand for health care services,” but instead of helping hospitals like some might imagine, insurance companies and at-home or managed care providers are the ones really benefiting.', 'Morgan Stanley noted that hospitals saw a 9.5% increase in expenses in 2021, and only managed to collect roughly 27% of the $2.6 trillion they billed for services. On top of that, higher costs at hospitals have driven many consumers to outpatient facilities and at-home care.', 'The home care market has grown at an annualized rate of 2.8% over the past five years to $132 billion in 2023, and Morgan Stanley expects that growth rate to jump to 2.9% through 2031. “Care delivery is increasingly moving from traditional brick-and-mortar hospital settings to at-home care with innovative care delivery companies leading the way,” the investment bank’s analysts wrote.', 'This shift to at-home care should benefit UnitedHealth Group, which owns primary, hospice, palliative, and at-home care providers and enablers including Optum, LHC Group, Landmark, Summit Home Care, and NaviHealth.', '“Industry leaders like UNH and Humana (not covered) have built horizontally integrated home health offerings,” Morgan Stanley’s team noted. “In our coverage, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) looks best positioned to capitalize, targeting home health care as a growth driver and making major investments across the space.”', 'The investment bank has a buy-equivalent “overweight” rating and a $618 price target on shares of UnitedHeath Group.', 'The other way to play the U.S.’s aging population is through health care REITs that own and/or manage the health care facilities that many seniors will need to visit during their twilight years. Morgan Stanley expects the number of residents in independent living, assisted living, and skilled-nursing housing to rise from roughly 1.7 million today to 2.1 million by 2030. And with inventory growth for every type of senior housing at “multiyear lows,” demand for senior housing should exceed supply.', '“We favor senior housing exposure given limited supply and demographic tailwinds are driving solid growth in occupancy and rents,” the investment bank’s analysts explained.', 'To their point, senior housing occupancy rates recovered dramatically from their first quarter 2021 lows of around 80% to 87% in the fall of last year. And senior housing rent growth was sitting at 5% in the third quarter of 2023, compared with just 0.5% in the first quarter of 2021. This should help boost health care REITs’ revenue.', 'The Morgan Stanley team went on to describe Welltower, a roughly $53 billion REIT that invests in senior housing, post-acute care, and outpatient medical facilities, as their “preferred large-cap play” in the senior housing space. They noted that the company has 87.5% of its properties within a five-mile radius of a hospital. As more hospitals face financial headwinds and increase their prices, that could benefit Welltower’s senior housing portfolio.', 'American Healthcare REIT, a $1.7 billion market-cap real estate company that invests in outpatient facilities, skilled-nursing facilities, and other types of senior housing, is the analysts’ “preferred small-cap” play to take advantage of the U.S.’s aging population. The group noted that many states have made it nearly impossible to construct the type of senior housing and outpatient medical facilities that American Healthcare REIT operates, with some requiring providers to get a Certificate of Need (CON) to buy, expand, or alter any home health, hospice, or senior living operations.', 'As a result of demographic headwinds and a lack of senior housing supply, Morgan Stanley expects 10% funds from operation growth—a metric used to measure REITs’ profitability—in 2025 and 2026 from both American Healthcare REIT and Welltower, compared with just 2% to 4% for REITs in general.', 'The investment bank has a buy-equivalent “overweight” rating and a $102 price target on shares of Welltower. American Healthcare REIT was also recently tagged with an “overweight” rating and a $17 price target.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Dior J’adore Eau de Parfum and Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb lip luminizer are just a sample of some of the new products that could help LVMH level up its fragrances and cosmetics division. Social media trends — like morning skincare routine videos on TikTok — also stand to bolster demand for such premium products.', 'With the biggest and best luxury brands in the beauty scene, LVMH stands out as a great way to play that trend.

As long as their financials remain strong and there's room for a dividend hike, odds are that a business will increase its payout at around the same time as it did the year before. "", ""Based on when they last raised their dividend payments, three stocks that are likely to announce dividend hikes next month include Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG). Let's take a closer look at their track records and whether these are good dividend stocks to buy today."", ""Big-box retailer Costco doesn't offer investors the biggest yield at 0.6%, but it makes for an underrated dividend investment. That's because it occasionally surprises investors with a special dividend. Last year, it announced a $15 per share special dividend. That's massive when you consider that on an annual basis its regular dividend pays just $4.08 per share."", 'But the other reason it makes for a good dividend play is that Costco routinely increases its payouts. In April 2023, the company announced a 13% increase to its quarterly dividend, which now pays $1.02 per share. The dividend has more than doubled since the start of 2018 when the stock was paying $0.50 per quarter. ', ""Costco's modest 27% payout ratio makes it almost a lock to announce another rate hike in April. Although its yield may seem modest, long-term investors can still generate a lot of income from its dividends as the company has shown that it is not hesitant to reward its shareholders through rate hikes and special dividend payments. Costco isn't a cheap stock, trading at 48 times earnings, but if you're buying and holding for decades, this can still be a great investment to add to your portfolio today."", ""Johnson & Johnson has been increasing its payouts for decades. It's a Dividend King, and it would be big news if the company didn't raise its dividend in April. Continuous dividend hikes are a key reason investors buy and hold the stock as it offers a fairly high yield of 3.1%, and the rate increases mean that investors can collect more dividend income in the future."", ""On April 18, 2023, Johnson & Johnson announced a 5.3% increase to its quarterly dividend. It was the 61st consecutive year that the company raised its payout. Although the stock's payout ratio is near 90% (due to high litigation-related expenses in 2023), another rate hike is likely still coming in April. The healthcare giant projects adjusted operational sales growth of at least 5% in 2024 and adjusted earnings to rise by more than 6%. "", ""While a rate hike is probable, this may turn out to be one of the riskier dividend stocks to own, given the ongoing talc litigation and the risks Johnson & Johnson faces on that front. And that's the main reason why although this may seem like an otherwise great stock to own, it may not be worth investing in right now."", 'Top consumer company Procter & Gamble, which is known for popular brands such as Pampers, Bounty, and Tide, has also earned a reputation over the years as being a top dividend growth stock. Its impressive streak of dividend increases surpasses even Johnson & Johnson. Last April, the company announced a dividend hike, extending its streak to a 67th consecutive year. The 3% bump to the payout was a modest one, but in a span of five years the dividend has grown by 31%. ', ""Procter & Gamble's payout ratio is around 63%, which is where you might expect the ratio to fall for a company that prioritizes dividends but that also has a strong, growing business. At 2.3%, its yield is still higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.4% while giving investors an incentive to also stick around for the expected rate hikes. "", 'In the trailing 12 months, the company has generated $14.5 billion in earnings on sales of $83.9 billion for a solid profit margin of 17%.

First are small caps, represented by the Russell 2000, which now trade below their 10-year average price-to-book ratio.

The company lowered its product risk with reinsurance in 2022, ceding its in-force retail fixed annuity and universal life insurance with secondary guarantee (ULSG) blocks. The balance sheet strength assessment also benefits from historically favorable financial flexibility, liquidity profiles and significant excess capital and access to capital markets at the holding company level. AM Best’s favorable view of the company’s capital is somewhat offset by Principal’s higher allocations to commercial mortgages in comparison with the group’s peers and usage of its captive reinsurers.', 'The company has consistently reported favorable profitability metrics, benefiting from its diverse lines of business, distribution channels and leading market positions.

Efforts to diversify its portfolio and strengthen its mixed-use assets, backed by a solid balance sheet, seem encouraging for long-term growth. However, higher e-commerce adoption, tenant bankruptcies and macroeconomic uncertainties raise concerns. High interest rates add to its woes.', ""Federal Realty owns properties in the first-ring suburbs of the nine major metropolitan markets of the United States, mainly in the key coastal markets from Washington D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Given the solid demographics and infill nature of its properties, the company experiences decent leasing activity, aiding occupancy growth.The company enjoys a well-diversified tenant base of retailers, including industry bellwethers like TJX Companies, Ahold Delhaize and CVS Corporation. This limits the company’s risk to any particular retail industry and positions it well for experiencing a stable source of rental revenues. As of Dec 31, 2023, no single tenant accounted for more than 2.7% of the annualized base rent. We estimate year-over-year growth of 3.8%, 5.4% and 7.5% in the company’s rental income in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.Federal Realty’s efforts to diversify its portfolio with residential and office properties are likely to pay off well. Exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, will enable the company to tap into growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.Going forward, Federal Realty has expertise in raising its operating performance through the conversion, redevelopment and repurposing of assets. As of the end of 2023, throughout the portfolio, Federal Realty has redevelopment projects underway. Its in-process strategic redevelopment pipeline is encouraging, with $320 million of projects in process. Also, this retail REIT has ongoing improvements at 16 properties to better position the assets to capture a disproportionate amount of retail demand. Such efforts bode well for FRT’s long-term growth.Federal Realty focuses on maintaining a decent balance sheet position with ample liquidity. The company exited 2023 with $1.3 billion of total liquidity in cash and credit facility proforma for January financing activity and dividends paid. The annualized net debt-to-EBITDA ratio came in at 5.9, down from 6 as of Sep 30, 2023. It is targeting a ratio in the mid-5x over the next year.The company has no debt maturities remaining in 2024 and no material maturities until 2026. Federal Realty’s credit ratings of BBB+ and Baa1 from Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively, enable it to procure debt financing at a favorable cost.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 0.1% in the past month against the industry's decline of 3.4%. Analysts seem bullish, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 funds from operations (FFO) per share being revised marginally upward over the past month."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'However, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to remain a popular choice among customers. Consequently, this is expected to adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores and affect Federal Realty.Further, macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent in the coming quarters. Also, the likelihood of tenant bankruptcies in the near term could affect the company’s profitability and hurt occupancy.Given the prevailing high interest rate environment, Federal Realty may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side. We anticipate a year-over-year rise of 5.3% in the company’s interest expenses in 2024.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the broader REIT sector are Host Hotels & Resorts HST and Iron Mountain IRM, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

Moreover, it counts famed investor Warren Buffett among its fans, which goes a long way in boosting investor sentiment."", ""However, I'd buy shares of PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) today if I were forced to choose between it and Coca-Cola. Don't get me wrong: I often drink Coke products and have loved the iconic branding since I was young."", ""But Pepsi has something that Coke doesn't and it makes all the difference for me when thinking about these two companies as an investor, not a consumer."", 'Both Pepsi and Coca-Cola are Dividend Kings, meaning that each has paid and increased the dividend annually for at least 50 years.', 'With dividend stocks, two important metrics are the dividend yield and the dividend payout ratio. The dividend yield tells investors how much annual dividend income they can expect relative to their investment -- a 1% yield gives $1 per $100 invested.', ""But dividends aren't guaranteed; companies can stop paying them if they don't have enough earnings. And that's why a payout ratio is important. A payout ratio shows how much of a company's earnings are being used for the dividend."", 'Pepsi and Coke are extremely similar when it comes to the dividend yield and the payout ratio, as the chart below shows.', ""If one of these two companies had a better track record, a higher yield, or a lower payout ratio, then perhaps my opinion would be different. But Pepsi and Coca-Cola are very alike in these important metrics, which doesn't give either company an edge."", ""This is why I'm looking at something else when picking Pepsi stock over Coca-Cola stock today."", 'When people think of Coca-Cola and Pepsi, they think of two behemoth beverage businesses. And in the case of Coca-Cola, this is true -- the company is a pure-play beverage company and one of the very best at what it does. However, Pepsi is a much more diverse business, which is why I prefer it over Coca-Cola.', 'In addition to beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Mug Root Beer, PepsiCo owns snacking brands with its Frito-Lay division and it also sells food items with its Quaker Oats segment.', ""Pepsi breaks out the numbers for Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats in North America. These business segments in this market accounted for nearly 31% of Pepsi's overall revenue in 2023. Moreover, they accounted for a whopping 60% of Pepsi's operating profit."", ""By having business operations in beverages, snacks, and foods, PepsiCo is a diverse business and that comes in handy. Investing is about taking a long-term perspective and many unforeseen things can happen with a business or the economy. But I'm fairly confident that Pepsi will perform better than some of its peers because if one part of its business slips, it has the other parts of the business to hold it steady."", 'It\'s more than just this: Pepsi\'s ""other"" businesses are also an important component of future profitable growth. In the company\'s earnings call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023, CEO Ramon Laguarta pointed out that snacks have pushed its international operations to a $40 billion business annually. And this scale is important.', 'According to Laguarta, Pepsi\'s scale in international markets is leading to higher profits. And to him, this means that international growth is the company\'s ""most remarkable and exciting opportunity."" In short, more growth outside of the U.S. will lead to more economies of scale and better profits.', 'Therefore, between these two companies, I see a clearer path for Pepsi to grow its profits compared to Coca-Cola. And I believe that profit growth will give Pepsi a better opportunity to keep growing its dividend for many years as well as provide more upside potential for the stock.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PepsiCo wasn’t one of them.

About two years ago, a number of high-profile corporations made such moves after their shares rose to unwieldy levels. Now, Chipotle, one of the leading fast-casual restaurant chains, is on the verge of conducting a 50-for-1 stock split. It was arguably about time -- Chipotle currently trades for close to $3,000 per share.', ""In that spirit, other major corporations whose shares have soared in recent years could also benefit from stock splits. Let's consider two examples: Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN)."", ""Eli Lilly has conducted several stock splits in its long and storied history, but the last time it did so was in 1997. A lot has changed at the company since then. In recent years, Eli Lilly's shares have crushed the stock market. It is now the largest healthcare company by market capitalization. Its share price is getting up there -- the stock is currently at just under $771. There are excellent reasons to think the drugmaker will continue to beat the market and could hit $1,000 soon, so a stock split could be in the cards soon."", ""Eli Lilly's most significant growth driver will almost certainly be tirzepatide, which it markets as Mounjaro to treat type 2 diabetes and Zepbound as a weight loss treatment. Tirzepatide is gaining considerable traction. Last year, it generated just over $5 billion in sales despite it being its first full year on the market. Still, Eli Lilly has encountered some headwinds. Most recently, the Food and Drug Administration delayed its decision on whether or not to approve the company's potential Alzheimer's disease therapy, donanemab."", ""The agency has convened a panel of experts to weigh the data from the clinical trial Eli Lilly conducted to support donanemab's application. The worst-case scenario for the company is that it won't earn approval, but even if that happens, Eli Lilly will be just fine, at least over the middle term. (There certainly could be a sell-off of the stock in the immediate aftermath of a negative decision.) The company's lineup extends far beyond tirzepatide, and it also boasts an incredibly rich pipeline that will lead to a number of new drug approvals and label expansions."", 'So, the future remains bright for Eli Lilly regardless of what happens with donanemab. Whether or not management decides to conduct a stock split, Eli Lilly is an excellent company to invest in for the long term.', ""Regeneron has never conducted a stock split, but it might be starting to think about one with its share price in the neighborhood of $960. Regeneron should also continue to deliver excellent returns, just as it has in recent years. The company's two most important products -- wet age-related macular degeneration therapy Eylea, and eczema treatment Dupixent -- still have plenty of growth potential."", ""Regeneron shares the rights to Eylea with Bayer, and it co-markets Dupixent with Sanofi. It earned approval for a high-dose formulation of Eylea last year that should attract a reasonable number of patients (thanks to it offering fewer doses) while extending the medicine's patent life. The new version of Eylea is the counter to Vabysmo, a competing treatment developed by Roche Holding and first approved in 2022."", ""Meanwhile, Dupixent could soon earn a label expansion in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, an important indication that should add over $1 billion annually to the drug's sales. Further, Regeneron has multiple programs in late-stage clinical trials. Though the company's financial results have been somewhat inconsistent in recent years, that has been due to the uneven contributions of its COVID-19 antibody therapy. The declining demand for this product won't negatively affect Regeneron's results for much longer."", 'Investors should expect strong top- and bottom-line growth for the company for the foreseeable future, along with excellent stock price gains. Will Regeneron finally conduct its first stock split as its shares become less affordable to the average investor? Only time will tell. Regardless, the stock looks highly attractive.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

Instead it will initially be funded by its own team, and then make money by selling its programs early, Krieg told BioPharma Dive.', 'The unusual business model is a change of pace for Krieg, a well-known scientist in genetic medicine. Krieg co-founded and helped build three venture-backed startups that eventually went public: Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Translate Bio and Checkmate. Both Coley and Translate were also acquired.', 'Krieg thought he’d retire after selling Checkmate. The company had lost about two-thirds of its value during its run as a public company and was in danger of running out of money before Regeneron’s deal closed. It sold for less than its IPO price.', '“I remember swearing to people I wouldn’t start another company,” Krieg said, in an interview.', 'His plans changed after some time away, though. Krieg envisioned ways to improve on his work at Checkmate. There, he had packaged a DNA sequence into a type of virus-like particle to create what’s now called vidutolimid, a medicine that stimulates cancer-fighting T cells. It’s now in Phase 2 testing at Regeneron. Afterwards, he designed a new drug containing different genetic sequences — RNA as well as DNA, he said — and stuffed into the fatty shells, or “lipid nanoparticles,” that are used to deliver a variety of other medicines.', 'Krieg had the drug made in a contract laboratory. Early tests in cells showed it appeared more potent than vidutolimid, driving a broader T cell response that might be useful when paired with other cancer therapies.', '“I started thinking, what am I going to do with this?” he said.', 'Krieg reached out to former Checkmate colleagues and over the summer started Zola. However, venture firms weren’t interested and Krieg was hesitant to give up control. So he and his ex-team came up with a different idea: front the costs of obtaining preclinical results for a drug candidate, sell it to a pharmaceutical company, pocket some of the profits and use the rest to do it all over again.', 'The company’s existence, along with its plans, were revealed in LinkedIn posts by Krieg earlier this month.', 'Drug development is an expensive and yearslong process, which is why startups usually need substantial funding from private and public investors to survive. The value of a drug also climbs as it’s advanced in testing, leading to larger financial rewards the longer its developer maintains ownership.', 'What’s more, cancer immunotherapy is a competitive field that has seen many failures over the past decade. Many promising prospects have fallen short and some investors have turned their focus to other areas, making Zola’s pitch more difficult.', 'Krieg acknowledges the long odds. But he claims he can get the first candidate through an animal study for less than $2 million and expects data this fall. If the results entice a pharma into a deal, Zola could make more molecules that are fine-tuned in different ways — all without seeking money from investors.', ""“I’d rather our team controls its own destiny,” he said. “I want to see as many patients benefit from this as I can. Even if the economics are not as great as they would be with some other model, they're going to be good enough that we can accomplish our mission and vision.”"", 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

Wood is best known for making big bets in emerging areas of technology and healthcare.', 'In a shareholder letter published earlier this month, she suggested that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could end up like Cisco in the aftermath of the dot-com boom in the early 2000s.', ""Given the meteoric rise in Nvidia's stock price over the last year, it's reasonable to believe a pullback could be on the horizon. But calling for a crash akin to Cisco? That seems dramatic."", 'Instead, I think a different ""Magnificent Seven"" stock could be at risk of falling out of favor with investors. Let\'s dig into why I see Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as much more likely to follow in Cisco\'s footsteps.', ""Latent needs are an interesting concept. Simply put, a latent need is a problem that people don't even realize they have."", ""Apple is the king of solving latent needs. With the iPod, iMac, iPhone, iPad, and AirPods, the company revolutionized personal computing, communications, and entertainment in ways that people didn't even realize were needed."", ""The company's long list of innovative hardware made it one of the most recognized brands around the world."", ""As investors salivate over all things related to artificial intelligence (AI), Apple is yet again remaining tight-lipped about its plans. I don't think this is the best move after some of the company's flops in recent history."", 'Given how quiet the company has been on the innovation front, I think overcommunicating might be an appropriate strategy right now. Sure, it just shipped its virtual reality (VR) headset, the Vision Pro. But for now, I think people are more intrigued by the idea of VR, rather than the actual use of the technology in their daily lives.', 'After years of playing coy, news broke earlier this month that the company was abandoning its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions. And big tech cohorts Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft all dominate cloud computing -- a movement that Apple missed entirely.', 'Apple only recently made headlines in the AI realm following its acquisition of a start-up called DarwinAI. While this deal was interesting, details surrounding how it plans to leverage DarwinAI are sparse.', 'By contrast, Nvidia is aggressively entering new AI markets that it can disrupt. For example, the company is an investor in humanoid robotics start-up Figure AI, as well as a partner with enterprise software platform Databricks.', ""Among mega-cap tech companies, Nvidia is emerging as the front-runner in AI. Demand is soaring for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services."", ""In 2023, Nvidia's revenue increased 126% year over year, while profits and free cash flow grew nearly sixfold. On the other hand, Apple's revenue has been in decline for a year as demand for luxury hardware devices has stalled against the backdrop of a tough economy."", ""Cisco is one of the most interesting case studies in recent business history. The company was hailed as a leading innovator during the early stages of the internet age. But after competitors began producing similar products, Cisco failed to pivot and move on. Given Nvidia's broad reach across the AI spectrum, I find Wood's comparison to Cisco lacking."", ""Sure, like Cisco back in the late 1990s, Nvidia stock soared to unprecedented levels. But I think the company's momentum is just getting started. The long-term narrative surrounding AI is encouraging, and right now the chipmaker appears to be the engine powering all sorts of applications."", ""By contrast, Apple stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 26 -- higher than both Meta Platforms and Alphabet as of the time of this writing. It's tough to justify this premium when the company appears to be at a crossroads. It isn't growing, demand for its products is in decline, it abandoned EV's, and it doesn't appear to have any tangible strategy related to AI."", ""Could competition ultimately pose a threat to Nvidia? It probably will. But this is why I find the company's investments in robotics and software to be savvy moves. It is clearly exploring markets beyond its core chip business, which will hopefully prove fruitful in the long run."", ""Given the amount of unknowns surrounding Apple, I see the company as an enigma right now. As an investor, I'm not concerned about Nvidia's prospects. But given the lack of innovation from Apple for several years, I think there is a real possibility the company could end up in a situation similar to that of Cisco at some point."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.
