This includes, but is not limited to, our\xa0expectation and ability to pay a cash dividend on our\xa0common stock in the future, subject to the determination by our\xa0Board of Directors and based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation determinations, and other factors, risks, and uncertainties.

You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.', 'Other factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.', 'Notes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures ', 'We have\xa0provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our\xa0operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe\xa0that our\xa0presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results,\xa0for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management.', 'EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses: EBITDA represents GAAP net income from continuing operations adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense; and (iv) provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss. Adjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe\xa0these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparison.', 'Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS: Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income from continuing operations adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We believe\xa0these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our\xa0results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items.', 'Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe\xa0free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.', 'Organic:\xa0Organic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale) and nonrecurring gain/loss associated with cost-based and equity method investments\xa0that have occurred over the past year.\xa0An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date.\xa0Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP).\xa0Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent dispositions, for which results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability.', 'Organic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate: Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we\xa0transact\xa0changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar; accordingly, we\xa0present\xa0certain constant currency financial information to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\xa0We calculate\xa0constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the currency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe\xa0organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating performance of our\xa0business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.', 'See page 10\xa0for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and a\xa0segment results summary and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA.\xa0See page 11\xa0for a reconciliation of segment adjusted EBITDA margin, a\xa0reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA expenses,\xa0and a reconciliation of diluted adjusted EPS.

LGILX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance."", 'Objective', 'LGILX is classified in the Large Cap Growth segment by Zacks, an area full of possibilities. Companies are usually considered to be large-cap if their stock market valuation is more than $10 billion. Large Cap Growth mutual funds invest in many large U.S. firms that are projected to grow at a faster rate than their large-cap peers.', 'History of Fund/Manager', 'Schwab Funds is responsible for LGILX, and the company is based out of San Francisco, CA. Since Schwab Select Large Cap Growth Fund made its debut in July of 2009, LGILX has garnered more than $1.91 billion in assets. The fund is currently managed by Phil Ruvinsky who has been in charge of the fund since July of 2020.', 'Performance', ""Of course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 13.68%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3 -year annualized total return of 5.13%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame."", ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of LGILX over the past three years is 23.15% compared to the category average of 20.93%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 21.69% compared to the category average of 21.17%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""The fund has a 5-year beta of 1.1, so investors should note that it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. LGILX has generated a negative alpha over the past five years of -1.14, demonstrating that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Holdings', 'Exploring the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is principally on equities that are traded in the United States.', 'This fund is currently holding about 94.07% in stocks, which have an average market capitalization of $485.92 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:', 'Technology', 'Retail Trade', ""This fund's turnover is about 49%, so the fund managers are making about the same amount of trades as its comparable peers every year."", 'Expenses', 'For investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, LGILX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.74% compared to the category average of 0.94%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, LGILX is actually cheaper than its peers.', 'This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', 'Overall, Schwab Select Large Cap Growth Fund ( LGILX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a great potential choice for investors right now.', ""This could just be the start of your research on LGILXin the Large Cap Growth category.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of financial realities, you may go to the 10 Most Affordable Places to Retire in the U.S. in 2024. ', 'Is the United States still affordable for the average retiree? According to the Motley Fool, the median net worth among Americans aged 65 to 74 is $410,000. However, Americans are adamant about having at least $1.8 million for a comfortable retirement here in the US (according to a The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) study). While the gap between actual savings and the magic retirement number is rather large, savers have been slow to adopt solutions that can help them change this narrative. Evidently for them, embracing stress appears to be the more prudent choice.', 'A T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) Retirement Savings and Spending Survey confirms this notion, stating that 64% of baby boomers have moderate to high levels of stress concerning their retirement savings. To delve deeper into the retirement landscape, while a 3.2% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) may make this new year seem challenging, it pales in comparison to the anxiety some of us are experiencing as 2034 draws another year closer. For those asking why, this is the projected year for the depletion of Social Security funds. Unless things turn towards a new direction, beneficiaries will receive only 80% of their scheduled benefits from this date.', ""Returning to the present year, Medicare Part B standard premiums have increased by 6%, rebounding from a 3% decline in 2023. Additionally, annual deductibles for Part B have risen from $226 to $240. In other developments, a change implemented in 1983 regarding a gradual rise in Social Security's Full Retirement Age (FRA) to 67 is nearly complete. By the latter half of 2024, this FRA will reach 66 years and 8 months."", 'For the average retiree, this means that retiring earlier than the FRA will make them ineligible to claim 100% of their social security benefits. While individuals can retire as early as the age of 62, they are susceptible to losing as much as 30% of their benefits in the process. On the other hand, waiting past the FRA can help seniors reap an extra 8% benefits each year until the age of 70. While individuals do hesitate to retire early, many times the situation becomes entirely impossible to avoid.', 'Corporate downsizing and health concerns are the top reasons individuals exit the workforce much earlier than they initially anticipated. So what must the average retiree do to spend a comfortable retirement here in the US? Surely, there must be some best places to retire that can help them spend their golden years without the stress of barely making ends meet.', 'While T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) and similar investment management firms strongly emphasize the role of financial wellness in achieving financial goals and attaining long-term retiree success, even small steps taken in the right direction can help retirees ease their retirement path. For instance, relocating to some of the most affordable states to retire can be a wise move. Some of the best states to retire on social security include Mississippi, Iowa, Wyoming, and Georgia. According to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), the median price of a home in these states is $228,000, $221,400, $210,000, and $355,800, respectively.', 'Mississippi is hands down one of the most affordable states to retire in 2024, and median home prices in this state are up 1.9%, selling for a median price of $228,500 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). It has one of the lowest cost of living requirements too, considering the state has a low cost of living and a tax-friendly environment to boast.', ""Nevertheless, Hayden Adams of Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research asserts that taxes shouldn't be the only consideration when deciding your retirement destination. Friends and family, climate, quality of healthcare, and other factors important to you should also be considered. One way to go about this is rounding up a list of destinations and assessing which one can prove to be best for you considering all factors involved."", '""Whether you\'re a retiree, a remote worker, or just looking for a change of scenery, the idea of pulling up stakes for purportedly greener pastures isn\'t that unusual these days. However, the tax implications can be profound, so it\'s smart to take a hard look before you break out the packing tape.""', '-Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research.', 'Rob Hainer/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of most affordable places to retire in the U.S. in 2024, we began by rounding up an extensive list of the most affordable places ranked by prominent websites such as CNBC, US News & World Report, PODS, Bankers Life, and Finance Buzz, to name a few.

GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with USB.', ""On February 20, 2024, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), a leading diversified financial-services provider, filed its 10-K report, revealing a comprehensive overview of its operations and financial health. With a network of 2,274 banking offices and $512.3 billion in consolidated deposits as of December 31, 2023, U.S. Bancorp stands as a significant entity in the Western and Midwestern United States. The company's financial tables show a robust balance sheet, with notable increases in net income across its Consumer and Business Banking segments by 20.6% compared to the previous year. However, the Payment Services segment experienced an 11.2% decrease in net income. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the 10-K filing, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of U.S. Bancorp's market position and strategic direction."", ""Brand Power and Market Presence: U.S. Bancorp's strong brand and significant market presence are key strengths. With a history of stable financial performance and strategic acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of MUFG Union Bank, the company has solidified its position in the financial sector. The acquisition not only expanded its customer base but also enhanced its product offerings, contributing to a 6.0% increase in net income for its Wealth, Corporate, Commercial, and Institutional Banking segment in 2023. U.S. Bancorp's reputation for reliability and customer service continues to attract and retain customers, reinforcing its competitive edge."", ""Digital Banking Capabilities: The company's investment in digital banking services has paid off, with a significant percentage of consumer transactions now completed online or through its digital app. This focus on technology has improved customer convenience and operational efficiency, positioning U.S. Bancorp favorably against competitors who may be slower to adopt digital innovations. The company's network of 4,524 ATMs and 24-hour customer service further supports its strength in accessibility and customer engagement."", ""Sensitivity to Economic Fluctuations: U.S. Bancorp's performance is closely tied to the broader economic environment. Factors such as interest rate changes, unemployment rates, and credit quality can significantly impact the company's revenues and asset values. The 10-K filing acknowledges these vulnerabilities, noting the potential for adverse effects on the bank's financial stability during economic downturns. This sensitivity underscores the need for prudent risk management and diversified revenue streams to buffer against economic headwinds."", ""Regulatory Compliance Burden: The financial industry's regulatory landscape is complex and ever-changing. U.S. Bancorp's 10-K filing highlights the challenges of adapting to new regulatory requirements, which can be resource-intensive and restrict operational flexibility. The company's ability to satisfy these requirements is critical to its continued success, but the associated costs and efforts represent a significant weakness that requires ongoing attention and strategic planning."", 'Expansion through Technological Innovation: U.S. Bancorp is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital financial services. By continuing to invest in and develop its digital platforms, the company can attract tech-savvy customers and create new revenue streams. The rise of mobile payments, digital wallets, and digital currencies presents an opportunity for U.S. Bancorp to lead in innovation and expand its market share in the digital space.', ""Market Expansion and Diversification: The acquisition of MUFG Union Bank opens new markets and customer segments for U.S. Bancorp. This strategic move not only diversifies the company's portfolio but also provides opportunities for cross-selling and enhanced service offerings. By leveraging its expanded footprint and comprehensive financial services, U.S. Bancorp can capture additional market share and drive growth."", 'Competitive Pressure from Fintechs: The rise of financial technology companies, or fintechs, poses a significant threat to traditional banking institutions like U.S. Bancorp. Fintechs often operate with greater agility and fewer regulatory constraints, enabling them to offer competitive, innovative products quickly. U.S. Bancorp must continue to innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive position in the face of this growing challenge.', ""Cybersecurity Risks: In an increasingly digital world, the threat of data breaches and cyber-attacks is a constant concern. U.S. Bancorp acknowledges the importance of robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive customer information and maintain trust. Any failure in the company's security systems could lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and erosion of customer confidence, making cybersecurity a critical area of focus."", ""In conclusion, U.S. Bancorp's SWOT analysis reveals a financial institution with a strong market presence and a commitment to digital innovation, poised to capitalize on growth opportunities. However, economic sensitivity and regulatory challenges present ongoing risks that require careful management. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, U.S. Bancorp can navigate the competitive landscape and harness opportunities for expansion and technological advancement. The company's strategic focus on customer-centric services and operational efficiency will be crucial in mitigating threats and solidifying its position as a leader in the financial services industry."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The growth stock has been hammered since last week's earnings report, declining about 30%. This is a big setback to what started to look like a recovery in its stock price last year when shares rose 125%. A rough start to 2024 means the stock is still floundering at levels far below where it traded in years past; shares are down 85% over the last three years."", 'So, what gives? Why are investors moving on from this beaten-down tech stock? It boils down to fears about its well-capitalized competition. Investors are concerned that aggressive investment in the connected-TV space from deep-pocketed tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and now potentially even Walmart (NYSE: WMT) could make the operating environment increasingly difficult for Roku.', ""Perhaps providing clues to the competitive environment, Roku has consistently reported losses on an annual basis. Its total net loss in 2023 exceeded $700 million, or $5.01 per share. This is worse than the company's $3.62 loss per share in 2022. Further, the company said it expected a $90 million loss in the first quarter of 2024."", 'Intense competition from tech giants much bigger than Roku could be one reason the company has had trouble becoming profitable. In fact, to maintain its lead in the intensely competitive market, the company generally operates its devices business at a loss. Indeed, its gross profit margin for device sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 was negative 13%.', 'Some analysts have also been expressing concerns about increasing competition. Pivotal Research lowered its 12-month price target on the stock from $85 to $75 after the earnings report, noting that intensifying competition leaves little upside for the stock. MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said in a note to investors after the earnings report that the company appears to be getting ""squeezed by the emergence of challengers on all flanks.""', 'And then there\'s the fact that the advertising economic environment isn\'t necessarily out of the weeds. Roku management said in the company\'s fourth-quarter earnings call that the recent ad market recovery has been ""uneven."" Further, management said it remains ""mindful of the near-term challenges in the macroeconomic environment."" If the economic outlook worsens, particularly in the U.S., advertisers could pull back and Roku\'s losses could widen.', 'Worsening the narrative for Roku after an earnings report that disappointed investors last week, retail juggernaut Walmart announced on Tuesday morning it has agreed to acquire smart TV operating system maker Vizio (NYSE: VZIO). The company, which also sells smart TVs and other streaming TV devices, is a direct competitor to Roku.', '""We believe Vizio\'s customer-centric operating system provides great viewing experiences at attractive price points,"" said Walmart CEO Seth Dallaire in the press release about the deal. ""We also believe it enables a profitable advertising business that is rapidly scaling.""', ""Walmart's move into the space would add yet another competitor with far more resources than Roku. The deal, of course, is subject to regulatory clearance and other closing conditions. But if it goes through, there's almost no way to spin this news as a positive outcome for Roku."", ""Overall, things look rough for Roku going forward. It's not surprising that shares have been getting hammered."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

Target TGT, which reports on March 5th, continues to struggle to gain investors’ confidence.', 'Walmart’s Q4 earnings increased +5.4% from the year-earlier period on +5.7% higher revenues on better-than-expected same-store sales and improving gross margins. Management noted continued market share gains, particularly on the grocery side, as higher-income households find the combination of Walmart’s value proposition and digital offerings hard to resist.

Total earnings for these companies are up +43.1% from the same period last year on +8.4% higher revenues, with 89.5% beating EPS estimates and 63.2% beating revenue estimates.', 'The Q4 earnings growth pace of +43.1% is mostly thanks to Amazon’s blockbuster results, whose earnings increased +410.9% from the year-earlier level on +13.9% higher revenues. Excluding Amazon’s substantial earnings contribution, Q4 earnings for the rest of the Retail sector companies that have reported would be up +1.9% on +6.4% higher revenues.', 'Beyond the Retail sector, Q4 earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +5.5% above the year-earlier period on +3.2% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.8% increase in index earnings in 2023 Q3 on +2.3% higher revenues.', 'Given the expected moderation in the U.S. economy’s growth trajectory due to the cumulative effects of Fed tightening, these estimates likely need to come down.

Doug, we are now ready to begin."", 'C. Douglas McMillon', 'Good morning, and thanks for joining us to talk about our business. Our team delivered a great quarter, finishing off a strong year. We drove sales growth of 4.9% and adjusted operating profit growth of 10.9% in constant currency. Highlights include higher transaction counts and unit volumes, gains in market share in the U.S. and internationally, improved in-stock levels with inventory being in great shape and down versus last year, strong performance in Walmart U.S. customer experience scores even during the high volume days before Christmas. Plus, this year, we passed $100 billion in global eCommerce sales for the first time. We had a very good holiday season. We were strong in the U.S., Mexico, Canada and India, where we had the best Big Billion Days ever, and we continued the strong performance in China with the start of Chinese New Year. Typically, we see some of our customer experience scores dip during the high-volume hours and days we experience during the holidays. But during Q4, the Walmart U.S. team delivered 3-year high customer scores in our stores, for pickup and delivery from stores and for those orders that flow directly from our eCommerce fulfillment centers. I\'m excited about the omnichannel Net Promoter Score trends the team is driving. Across countries, we continue to see a customer that\'s resilient, but looking for value. As always, we\'re working hard to deliver that for them, including through our rollbacks on food pricing in Walmart U.S. Those were up significantly in Q4 versus last year, following a big increase in Q3. Our general merchandise prices are lower than a year ago, and even 2 years ago in some categories, which means our customers are finding value in areas like apparel and hardlines. In food, prices are lower than a year ago in places like eggs, apples and deli snacks, but higher in other places like asparagus and black berries. Dry grocery and consumables categories, like paper goods and cleaning supplies, are up mid-single digits versus last year and high teens versus 2 years ago. Private brand penetration is up in many of the countries where we operate, including the United States. During our Q3 call, I mentioned that we might find ourselves in a deflationary position early in calendar \'24. In Walmart U.S., we\'re there in general merchandise, but the slope of the decline softened during Q4, meaning the prices are lower than a year ago, but not as much as the trend line would have suggested at the end of Q3. We saw the trend line for food and consumables in Walmart U.S. soften, too, resulting in our retail prices in food and consumables being slightly higher than a year ago. In total, for Walmart U.S., our year-end retail prices on like-for-like items were inflated by about 80 basis points. Importantly, we\'re encouraged by our strength in terms of units and transactions. Sam\'s Club U.S. is in a similar pricing position to Walmart U.S.. And outside the U.S., our pricing comparisons to a year ago are in more of a normal range. We\'re excited about the momentum we see, and we\'re pleased with the quarter. But my focus stays primarily on what we\'re building for the longer term. That future is an omnichannel one, where we simultaneously strengthen our stores and clubs and build a more compelling eCommerce business. As it relates to strengthening our stores and clubs, we\'re investing in remodels and supply chain automation to improve the customer experience and increase productivity. Those things are going well. We\'ll remodel 928 stores and clubs globally over the next year, including 650 stores in the U.S. Not long ago, we shared that we would be building 30 new Sam\'s Clubs in the U.S. over the next several years. And more recently, we announced we will add more than 150 supercenters and neighborhood markets in the U.S. over the next 5 years. Most of those are new builds in locations where we need a new store, but a few of them will be discount store conversions to a supercenter, where we\'re relocating in the same community. Outside the U.S., we\'ll open around 230 stores and clubs next year, mainly in Mexico and Central America and in China, where they\'ll mostly be Sam\'s Clubs. We ended the year with 47 Sam\'s Clubs in China, and they continue to be quite strong on the top and bottom line. We are, by far, the leading membership club operator in China with 28 years of experience there. So our physical fleet is getting stronger, and it plays a hybrid role serving customers and members when they visit and simultaneously enabling an important portion of eCommerce. Beyond our stores and clubs, we\'re continuing to strengthen our first and third-party eCommerce capabilities and scale those businesses around the world. The combination of Marketplace and the commissions that go with it, fulfillment services, membership, advertising and our smaller but fast-growing data monetization business enable us to grow our bottom line faster than our top line, while delivering everyday low prices for our customers and investing in our associates at the same time. Marketplace is an engine for our business. As we\'ve added more sellers in the U.S., we\'ve seen more of them use our fulfillment capabilities. Marketplace is also the fastest-growing aspect of eCommerce for us outside the U.S. That growth helps us drive our global ad business. For now, we see the biggest dollar impact from Walmart U.S. and in India from Flipkart. But as these businesses scale in places like Mexico and Canada, we expect to see a similar relationship. Globally, we drove advertising growth of 28% for the year to reach $3.4 billion. Our announcement today that we\'ve agreed to acquire VIZIO gives us the opportunity to reach and serve customers in new ways and connect more dots for those that advertise with us. Membership is another area, where we\'ll continue to enhance our offerings. Walmart+ members spend nearly twice as much with us as nonmembers, and they buy more over the course of a year. At Sam\'s Club U.S., we\'re rolling out new exit technology that enables our members to use Scan & Go to just walk out after completing their transaction on their phone, further enhancing their membership. Last year, we began describing ourselves as a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better. This description is really resonating for us inside the company. We can prioritize our associates, our values and our culture and put impactful technology to work to help us fulfill our purpose, strengthen the customer member experience and strengthen our company. Here are some recent examples of us being tech-powered. Our new generative AI-powered search on the Walmart U.S. app, which rolled out to iOS users last month and is coming to Android users this month, is a great example. One of those popular searches this month was, ""Help me buy a Valentine\'s Day gift."" And rather than searching separately for things like chocolates, a card, jewelry, flowers, the search returns a list of results that are relevant and curated. And Flipkart launched a similar generative AI search tool, which was available just in time for Big Billion Days. Another example is our ability to provide customers and members with more convenient and affordable delivery. We already offer express delivery in the U.S. where customers can get their orders delivered fast. But what if you need something faster? There\'s a pot of chili on the stove and you realize you forgot chili seasoning. Drone delivery can get it to you in 15 minutes or less. Delivering by drone isn\'t new to us. Over the last 2 years, we\'ve operated 37 hubs across 7 states, completing 20,000 deliveries. By the end of the year, we\'ll make it available to about 75% of households in Dallas-Fort Worth. I\'m really excited about how the pieces are coming together in the near term. Our customers will have an improved store experience given our remodels. They can pick up an order, have it delivered to their doorstep or into their home or get a fast drone delivery when they want it. And this flexibility is enabled by a more intelligent, more connected and more automated supply chain. From scaled businesses to our faster-growing newer businesses, we\'re well on track to continue to hit the financial targets we laid out and make important investments for the future. And while we do this, we can grow in a way that helps us achieve our goals of creating opportunities for our associates and becoming a more sustainable business. In 2017, we announced a bold ambition to work with our suppliers to reduce, avoid or sequester 1 gigaton, that\'s 1 billion metric tons, of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We call it Project Gigaton. Our merchants and suppliers got to work and made investments in practical things like energy efficiency, packaging redesign and load optimization. We\'ve reported steady progress since then, and we\'re excited to say that our suppliers have now reported projects exceeding that 1 billion metric ton mark 6 years early. We\'ll continue to work with our suppliers on real initiatives with real world impacts that make our products better and our business stronger. As we think about developing our associates, we want them to feel, think and act like owners. The degree to which our team takes ownership will have a big impact on our level of success. That\'s what motivated us to make shares of Walmart stock part of U.S. store manager compensation. It\'s also why we decided to do a 3-for-1 stock split. Today, more than 400,000 associates participate in our associate stock purchase plan. That\'s a big number. But hopefully, even more will choose to participate and take advantage of the 15% the company contributes for the first $1,800 purchased by an associate each year. Psychologically, it just feels better to buy a whole share, rather than a fraction. We believe in our plan, and we\'re looking for ways, in addition to our 401(k) and the match that goes along with it, to help our associates build wealth and do more than just earn a paycheck. I\'ll close by thanking our associates for delivering a great quarter to end the year where we\'ve accomplished so much. We\'re out to build on our momentum. We have strong omnichannel businesses globally, and they\'re getting stronger. We\'re focused on executing the plans we have for this year and beyond, which we believe will deliver top and bottom line growth within the framework we\'ve discussed and improve ROI over time. With that, I\'ll turn it over to John David.', 'John David Rainey', ""Thanks, Doug. We're excited about the progress we've made in growing and evolving our omnichannel platform in pursuit of our purpose to help people save money and live better. Our teams did a great job in the quarter, finishing the year strong. For the year, in constant currency, we achieved 5.6% net sales growth and over 8% adjusted operating income growth. We have strong underlying momentum exiting Q4 and are clear about the strategic initiatives we're seeing driving profitable growth in the years ahead. This is reflected in the sustained sales and operating income growth included in our FY '25 guidance. I'll recap Q4 results using the framework we introduced at our investor community meeting last year: growth, margins and returns. As a reminder, there's a supplemental presentation on our IR website with additional information beyond my remarks. First, growth. Constant currency sales increased nearly 5% or almost $8 billion in Q4 with strong growth from all 3 segments, led by increased transactions across in-store, club and eCommerce channels. International sales grew 13%, reflecting strength in Flipkart, Walmex and China. International eCommerce sales increased 44%, reaching a penetration level of 25%, which is a record high for us. This included Flipkart's largest ever Big Billion Days event, with 1.4 billion customer visits over the 8-day period. In the U.S., Walmart comp sales grew 4%, reflecting increased unit volume and share gains. Like-for-like sales inflation was about 1%, moderating approximately 160 basis points from Q3 levels. We saw better-than-expected holiday sales, including 2 record-breaking volume days leading up to Christmas. Store fulfilled delivery sales were up nearly 50%, and we reached a $2 billion monthly run rate. Delivery has been a key source of share gains among upper-income households and is also the most productive channel for acquiring Walmart+ members. Sam's Club U.S. delivered comp sales growth of 3.1%, excluding fuel, with strength in food, consumables and health categories. eCommerce sales increased 17%, and we gained a grocery share in both units and dollars. eCommerce continues to be a key point of differentiation for Sam's, with delivery and curbside driving eCommerce growth and in-club Scan & Go penetration up over 270 basis points. Turning to margins. Enterprise gross margins expanded 39 basis points. Customers are responding as we continue to manage pricing aligned to competitive historic price gaps. In addition, we had lower markdowns resulting from strong inventory management, with Walmart U.S. inventory down 4.5%, Sam's down over 8% and International relatively flat, excluding currency. This puts us in a good position to start the new fiscal year. The timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days was a partial offset to gross margins. And while category mix pressure continued this quarter, we're encouraged to see sequential improvement versus Q3.SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis deleveraged 16 basis points, largely due to higher variable pay expenses in the U.S. relative to last year as a result of exceeding our planned performance. One of the areas I'm most pleased about is the improvement in eCommerce profitability within the Walmart U.S. segment, resulting from lower eCommerce fulfillment cost and densifying the last mile. Our store proximity to customers is an advantage, as we increasingly use stores to fulfill eCommerce orders. We've lowered last mile store-to-home delivery cost by about 20% in the last year, even as we've shortened delivery times the same day from around 90% of stores. Combining the fulfillment efficiencies with the improved product margins of eCommerce, we far exceeded the 200 basis point goal we outlined at our investor community meeting and lowered eCommerce losses by more than 40% versus last year's level. We also saw another strong quarter from our portfolio of higher growth initiatives that reinforce our core omni-retail model. Global advertising grew approximately 33%, led by International's 76% growth. International's growth benefited from the timing of Big Billion Days, but still delivered full year growth of about 30%. Sam's ad business achieved a new high with almost 50% more advertisers versus last year. Walmart U.S. Connect ad sales grew 22%, with more than 50% growth from Marketplace sellers. We're encouraged by the strong demand from new advertisers as active advertiser counts increased over 20%. We're excited about our agreement with VIZIO to bring together their unique operating system and our Walmart Connect advertising business. This combination would create new opportunities for advertisers to connect with customers, empowering brands to realize greater impact from their advertising spend with Walmart. We believe the deal would close during FY '25. Due to certain transaction-related costs associated with the acquisition, including for talent retention and technology integration, we expect the deal to be slightly dilutive to EPS in the near term. We plan to finance the acquisition to use cash and/or debt. Importantly, we believe the transaction would be IRR-accretive, delivering returns ahead of our expected ROI. Within Marketplace and Fulfillment Services, Flipkart's momentum continued with double-digit growth. In the U.S. Walmart's Marketplace delivered strong holiday events, including Black Friday, our largest Marketplace sales day ever. Over the past year, we've increased sellers 20%, with approximately 30% of sellers using Walmart Fulfillment Services. And we're pleased with the trends in our membership programs around the world. Sam's Club U.S. reached another record high level for member counts in Plus Members penetration, which led to membership income growth of 10%. And Walmart Plus continues to grow double digits. Strong sales and margins led to fourth quarter adjusted operating income growth of more than 13%, while adjusted EPS of $1.80 increased to 5.3%. Below the line, higher interest and noncontrolling interests were headwinds to adjusted EPS. Moving to returns. We generated over $35 billion in operating cash flow this year, an increase of nearly 24% due to strong business performance and improvements from working capital initiatives. Return on investment improved approximately 230 basis points to 15%, a level last achieved in 2017. Our stepped-up investments aimed at improving margins and productivity resulted in capital expenditures of $20.6 billion. The magnitude of ROI improvements reflect some benefits from productivity initiatives that we initially expected to realize in FY '25. And as we announced this morning, we're pleased to raise the dividend by 9% this year, the largest increase in over a decade, reinforcing our commitment to strong cash returns to shareholders. And as we continue to execute on our long-range plan, we will continue to evaluate the appropriate payout ratio for our business. We have a clear vision to deliver our financial framework of growing operating income faster than sales. I'd like to spend the next couple of minutes on the initiatives we believe will drive improved incremental margins in the years ahead, even as we stay customer and top line focused, deliver value for them and invest in our people. Beyond steady broad-based sales growth across segments, incremental profits will be derived from four key areas: business mix; productivity benefits from our supply chain transformation and automation improvements; product mix; and geographic mix. These areas will contribute to improved e-Commerce economics over the next several years. Starting with business mix. As I noted previously, we're excited about how our newer, higher-growth businesses are scaling. Together, these businesses have significantly higher structural margins in our core retail business, and they are growing significantly faster, which has the effect of bending our margin curve upwards. Over the past year, global advertising grew 28% to about $3.4 billion. Walmart U.S. Marketplace revenue grew 45%, with more than 35% of orders fulfilled by Walmart Fulfillment Services. And lastly, global membership income grew 20%. Over our planning horizon, the growth of this portfolio is expected to be one of the largest drivers of operating income growing faster than sales. We believe global advertising and membership alone will represent 20% of annual operating income in FY '25. These profit streams allow us to fund investments in our core business, while also expanding our operating margins. Turning to supply chain transformation and automation. This was a significant year for the phased deployment of automated technologies to optimize our next-generation supply chain. This program spans several years, with activity stepping up in FY '25 and FY '26. To date, we've retrofitted 13 regional distribution centers with varying levels of automated storage and retrieval systems. This technology gets product to shelves faster and has meaningful benefits to productivity, both in our DCs and stores. With the progress we've made over the past year, we're on track toward our goal of having approximately 55% of our fulfillment center volume and roughly 65% of supercenters serviced by automation by the end of FY '26. Already, around 1,500 stores are receiving palletized freight from these DCs. There are also exciting benefits from technology being realized in our stores. We're using applications to drive speed and proficiency, including RFID and computer vision, as well as digital displays and labels to remove friction for both customers and associates. New digital tools that automate repetitive tasks or eliminate heavy lifting have increased associate productivity, and customers are benefiting from improved in-stock rates and associate accessibility, leading to customer experience scores up over 140 basis points in FY '24. We expect to begin seeing the enterprise financial benefits of upstream automation and cost to fulfill inventory efficiency, store productivity and wage leverage as we move through FY '25 with a more pronounced benefit in the second half. On product mix. Continuing to expand our e-commerce assortment is critical to earning first position consideration among customers. This is particularly true for general merchandise, including our Marketplace. We've accelerated visit frequency and built incredible trust through core essentials, like food and consumables. In fact, weekly active eCommerce customers grew 17% this last year. We're building on this trust by improving our general merchandise assortment, both on and offline. General merchandise also benefits as U.S. store remodels continue to perform well. We'll execute another 650 in Walmart U.S. in FY '25, on top of the nearly 700 remodels completed this year. We're also excited to be returning to store growth in the U.S., as Doug mentioned. Our supercenter store of the future design is resulting in stronger four-wall sales, while also delivering a sales lift in the surrounding trade area, as these modernized stores offer more capacity for pickup and delivery, are more engaging to shop and are improving customer perception about Walmart, especially in general merchandise, where we're encouraged by the share gains we're seeing. For general merchandise categories that surged during 2020 and '21 and have longer replacement cycles, such as electronics and housewares, we expect relative weakness to persist in FY '25, although we're hopeful to see directional improvement in the second half as comparisons ease. Lastly, geographic mix. Our international portfolio is accretive to sales and profit growth and is expected to be a larger contributor to enterprise performance. We're on pace to achieve our goals to reach approximately $200 billion in GMV and more than double profits by FY '28 from the FY '23 base. This implies high single-digit annual sales growth for the segment. In FY '24, International grew constant currency sales 10.6% and adjusted operating income over 15%. India, Walmex and China are the sales growth leaders. These 3 markets are expected to account for approximately 3/4 of international growth over the next several years. In India, Flipkart's growth continues to compound in the double digits, while PhonePe is now processing more than 6 billion monthly transactions and has reached 1.4 trillion in annual total payment volume, about 40% higher than 1 year ago. And Walmex continues to go from strength to strength. Turning to guidance. Relative to prior years, we're introducing a slightly wider range of potential outcomes given the size of our business and a greater degree of variability we've seen. There are 3 nuanced factors to consider for FY '25. First, FY '25 is a leap year, which adds an additional day in Q1. I'll refer to this effect in our Q1 guidance shortly. Second, we'll experience a 53rd week for comp sales in Q4. We've included a slide in our presentation to help with modeling this. And third, on January 30, we announced that the Board approved a 3-for-1 stock split effective February 23. We're offering full year and first quarter EPS guidance on a pre- and post-split basis. For FY '25, we expect net sales on a constant currency basis to grow between 3% and 4% and for operating income to grow 4% to 6%. We expect Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. net sales growth to fall in line with the enterprise and for International growth to be above enterprise growth. We expect all 3 segments to contribute to operating income growth, led by Walmart U.S., Walmart International and then Sam's U.S. At our Investor Day last April, we outlined a multiyear plan of growing sales approximately 4% and growing operating income even faster. We depicted that as a range of 4% to 8%. Looking at our growth over a 2-year period, combining FY '24 actuals and our guidance for FY '25 at the midpoint suggest we will grow sales more than 5% and operating income over 8% on average annually. This is aligned with the framework we laid out, and we're pleased with how we're executing on this plan. At the enterprise level, we expect sales to grow faster than operating income in the first half due primarily to the timing of technology spend. In the second half, we expect operating income growth to exceed our sales growth. And on a full year basis, we expect operating income growth to exceed sales growth by 150 basis points at the midpoint. This spread between operating income growth and sales growth in FY '25 is similar to what we experienced in FY '24. Adjusted operating income grew 250 basis points faster than sales, including a benefit of approximately 90 basis points from LIFO. As we've noted in the past, this relationship of operating income growing faster than sales won't occur every quarter, but we aim for the framework to hold on an annual basis at the enterprise level. We provided additional detail on guidance for interest, tax rate and noncontrolling interest in our press release. We expect FY '25 EPS in a range of $6.70 to $7.12 on a presplit basis and $2.23 to $2.37 on a post-split basis. As we continue the multiyear investment in technology and innovation to optimize our supply chain and stores, we expect CapEx to range between 3% to 3.5% of sales for the next couple of years. Importantly, we have good visibility to the ROI on these investments, and we're encouraged by what we're already seeing. For Q1, we expect sales growth of 4% to 5% and operating income growth of 3% to 4.5%. The leap year benefit is estimated to be approximately 100 basis points to sales growth. Operating income growth is expected to be below sales growth this quarter, reflecting the timing of technology expenses mentioned previously. We expect Q1 EPS in the range of $1.48 to $1.56 on a pre-split basis and $0.49 to $0.52 on a post-split basis. In closing, our FY '24 results demonstrated our ability to reshape our sales and operating income growth trajectory, and our guidance for FY '25 assumes operating income growing faster than sales again. Our value proposition is resonating with customers. We're deploying capital to proven and scalable investments in our people and platform, and our business model is evolving towards higher margins and returns. I'd like to thank our 2.1 million associates worldwide who are indeed making the difference in bringing our purpose and business strategy to life every day. We're excited that by making our stock more accessible to them, more of our associates can become owners and align their interest with our external stakeholders.I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question this morning is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.', 'Michael Lasser', ""My question is on the outlook for fiscal year 2025. At the outset of last year, Walmart guided to 2.5% to 3% constant currency sales growth. This year, it's guiding to 3% to 4% constant currency sales growth. Presumably, there's some benefit from the extra week and leap year within that outlook for this year. But essentially on a same store sales basis, you're guiding to a similar level, yet the impact from inflation is going to be a lot more moderate this year. So what do you see that's driving this, what seems to be a bit more optimistic outlook? And as part of that, if you could comment on what would have to happen in order to reach the high end of your operating margin outlook, that would also be quite helpful."", 'John David Rainey', ""Michael, this is John David. There's a lot to that question. Let me try to unpack that a little bit. I think it's helpful to go back a year and think about the mood and the tone around the overall macro environment. At that point in time, I think there was largely a consensus that we were going to enter a recession in the last year. Fortunately, we avoided that. And so I think, overall, we feel a little bit better about the health of the economy right now. That said, price levels certainly affect our forecast as well. So let me decompose our guidance just a little bit, spend a moment on this. I think there's a couple of important elements to point out. One is that, overall, we expect some level of improvement in gross profit. But I want to decompose that further because there's two elements to that. One is our product margin, which we are not relying on raising prices to achieve our long-range plan. So let me be very clear about that. The improvement in gross profit is mostly related to the change in our business mix. As we have these faster-growing, higher-margin parts of our business like advertising that are contributing to an outsized part of our portfolio. So we should expect to see some improvement in gross profit. Conversely, on the SG&A line, we do expect some amount of deleverage in our business, and I want to pause on that for a second because we recognize that EDLC is critical to being -- to performing on EDLP. And so we have a lot of focus on continuing to become more efficient, to continue to try to leverage aspects of the business that we can. But our business has changed. Just as I noted in my prior comment around business mix, that affects what happens in SG&A. As we rely on things like advertising, some of the expenses related to that hit the SG&A line. And so our focus as a team is on growing operating income, and you see that in our guidance. I'll also point out that while mix -- and I should say, product mix has been a headwind over the last 2 years, we do assume some amount of headwind going into the coming year as general merchandise is -- will be less of our business relative to food. So there is some persistent tail to that. In terms of what would have to happen to -- for us to hit the top end of our guidance, I think a couple of things. And we're most focused on what we can control, and that's the team executing on our plan. So that's our focus. But we're not immune to the whims of the economy. And certainly, there are economic outcomes that could cause us to move to the high end of the range or the low end of the range. But given where we are right now, going into the first part of this year, we feel really good about the plan. We feel really good about the way that the team is executing and the way that we're serving our customers."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank.', 'Krisztina Katai', ""So similarly, I wanted to start with gross margin, right? It was very strong in the quarter, up nearly 40 basis points for the enterprise. So was wondering if you could quantify the biggest drivers behind the improvement, if you look at higher-margin services with whole retail and how that gives you sort of confidence in the back half of the year for fiscal '25. And then John David, you talked about the improvements in digital contribution margin, certainly the drivers behind that. I was wondering if you could quantify it or maybe speak to the magnitude of improvement we've seen and sort of where that puts you on the path to breakeven or even profitability."", 'John David Rainey', ""Sure. I'll start on the answer to the improvement in gross margin, and John may want to jump in there. But we're just in a healthier place than we were a year ago, and I think inventory is a big part of that. As we noted, inventory in the U.S. was down 4.5%, down 8% for Sam's, and that just enables us to operate a lot more effectively. We saw markdowns in the quarter be notably less than they were the year before, and all those have an effect on gross margin. John, do you want to talk a little bit more about that, and I'll go back to eCom?"", 'John R. Furner', ""Sure, sure. Yes. Thanks, John David. Krisztina, thanks for the question. A few things I'd say in margin. Number one, the team is really committed to driving value for customers, and they did that in the quarter while improving margin. And I want to talk about value just a second. We're really proud about the fact that our roll by count is up significantly from a year ago, somewhere to what it was in the third quarter. Second, the value with customers is resonating well. We saw NPS levels at a high level throughout the quarter and all-time highs for the quarter, which we're also proud of. And then on the gross margin line as it relates to the overall flow-through, there are two things to consider there. One is sell-through was very strong throughout the quarter. Our inventory closed down 4.5%. This is the first year I can remember in my career being in stores in early December, and they were out of storage containers, product in the counter, in the back rooms. The teams did a very nice job getting inventory inside knowing what they owned and selling through. And the sell-through that was strong at the holiday events. We mentioned two of our strongest days ever were in December, just leading up to Christmas. The strong sell-through led to lower markdowns. And the markdowns were, by far, the biggest impact on margins in the U.S. And then the second impact would have been from business mix. So John David said that earlier, but those are the two factors that improved it. And we feel good about our inventory position as we begin this year. We ended the year clean. Store managers and associates have backrooms that are quite under control. They feel very good about their inventory levels, and we're really proud of how they performed."", 'John David Rainey', ""Sure. And Krisztina, I'll address the improvement that we have seen and expect to continue to see in our contribution margin on eCommerce. There's a couple of elements to this. One is I'm really pleased with the way the team has performed on cost of fulfillment. That has gone down 20% in the last year. A lot of hard work has gone into making that happen. But the unit economics of delivering a package to a customer or a member have simply improved. So that's a big part of the improvement we've seen, and we expect to see continued improvements there. The second aspect of this is the densification of our network, specifically the last mile. As we have more customers coming to us, using us through eCommerce channels, it enables us to spread that cost of delivery over multiple customers. And so if you think about an item, like our weekly active customers on eCommerce, that's up 17%, much more than our top line. And so customers are recognizing that they can come to Walmart for convenience just as much as they can on price, and that actually helps the profitability of this channel for us. In terms of where we -- or when we can get to profitability, we have line of sight to eCommerce being breakeven when we include all the various components of this advertising, Fulfillment Services, all that together. But to be clear, we're focused on getting to eCommerce profitability, even without the subsidization of those additional items. That's a little further down the road. We have a lot of work to do to get to that point. But we're really pleased with the progress that we've made and the plan that we have going forward."", 'C. Douglas McMillon', ""I think big picture as it relates to the business model, scale has helped a lot. Getting to $100 billion for the year is a different number than what we were dealing with before, and it's nice to have growth coming on top of that. And as John David said, the formula, whether it's in the U.S. or it's in other markets around the world, is now clear to us. We're in execution mode as it relates to these things. And obviously, route density helps, volume helps, mix as it relates to contribution profit as part of the equation. And it's exciting to see, whether it's Walmex or it's what's happening in India, in addition to what we've been talking about in the U.S. with Walmart and Sam's, the commonalities that we're now experiencing, it feels like for some time now, we've really kind of known what we're doing. And omni is an advantage, figuring out how to leverage stores and clubs, what role they play has been part of that journey as well."", 'Kathryn J. McLay', ""And if I can just comment still in China. If you look at their progress over the last few years, they had a digital penetration of about 4% in 2019. They're now at 48%. It's almost 50-50 offline and online, and we're driving our profit through that business. So I think they've shown a path to really growing omni sales profitably."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.', 'Simeon Ari Gutman', ""Doug, I was going to ask you to kind of keep it high level. For fiscal '24, the prior year, it was a tough consumer year. But strategically, Walmart made progress on a lot of fronts. If you look at fiscal '25, if -- can you boil down the year 1 to 3 measures of success, and I have some ideas, but I won't preload the question? And then -- so what will define success in terms of strategic initiatives? And then just secondarily, any evolving thoughts about reinvestments in the business? So the business should continue to see higher EBIT growth over the next several years. Do you -- since you have one year or at least a couple of years under your belt now of seeing that evolve, do you find that the investment rates should be any greater, such that not all of that flows through?"", 'C. Douglas McMillon', ""Thanks, Simeon. I feel good about the reinvestment rate. And if you look at what our plans include, whether it's on the OpEx or CapEx side, I think we're being aggressive, and it is exciting to be in a position where we can play off in some price to the degree we need to. We can invest in associate wages and, at the same time, we can grow operating income faster than sales. And when I look back at last year and then how that plays through to FY '25, I think the themes are the same. We got to keep the top line going, and this business has always been so fun as it relates to just being a merchant driving sales. And I like the fact that we've got an opportunity across so many categories, food, consumables, general merchandise, apparel. And as prices come down on the general merchandise side, there's an opportunity to show off our merchant skills and to drive more units. And that's one of the reasons why, to Michael's question, to start this conversation, we have some confidence is because we're seeing our units move and our share numbers look strong. So top line is a focus. I think we're positioned to grow that because we can do that in-store club, pick up, delivery, however people want to be served. The second thing I'd mention is the automation plan. And I think in the U.S. where we're most aggressive, we'll see over the next few years a higher level of inventory accuracy, improved flow which will help us with markdowns, associate wage productivity, all the metrics that we've been talking about with you guys in particular for the last year. So I think automation is the next theme. And then the last one that I'll mention is all of the things that flow from Marketplace and advertising. I think we've learned a lot about Marketplace over the last few years, and we're working together to build what is a multi-country Marketplace business, which will help us not only with commissions related to Marketplace and Fulfillment Services scale, but it will also help us with advertising and data monetization and some of the other keys to changing the shape of the P&L or the business mix, as we refer to it. So those are the things that come to the top for me, and that's what I stay focused on."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.', 'Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh', ""So I just want to go back to the Walmart U.S. general merchandise category. Just curious how the remodels have continued to perform as I believe you're soon be lapping the Teterboro opening. And then as you look at the general merchandise offering, curious if you're seeing any green shoots. Just trying to get a sense of when we can start to expect a return to positive growth."", 'John R. Furner', ""Rupesh, it's John. Really pleased with the team. They're growing top and bottom line, and we're investing in the future. As we talked about this year, we're planning to do 650 more remodels. We did close to 700 last year, which is, I think, our largest year and had a really big month in the month of November. The results are very promising. As you know, there is more space for customers. We opened the store up. We're really proud of the results in apparel and home, beauty. We see positive signs out of the pet department. As there are a number of things that are coming together in the fourth quarter, in particular, we're really pleased with the toy performance where we saw unit share gains with big brands like LEGO, Mattel, Melissa & Doug. So there's some really nice signs coming out of those stores, and we're real looking forward to this year to put another, as we said, 650 remodels out in the market."", 'C. Douglas McMillon', ""And you've consistently performed seasonally. I think as we look forward to this year, whether it's Easter, back-to-school, all the way through the holiday again, people come to Walmart for seasonal purchases. And we've got a great strength there that we plan to build on."", 'John R. Furner', ""We do, Doug, it's been a lot of fun to see how these came together. As I mentioned, the sell-throughs are really strong throughout the fourth quarter. And Valentine's Day was a strong holiday early in the year. We -- because we're so close to customers, we were delivering same day up until 8:30 that night. I wouldn't recommend that for everyone. But certainly, the capability to be able to take flowers to someone at 8:30 who had a bit of a moment was a lot of fun. Save the day."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Kelly Ann Bania', ""Wanted to just talk a little bit more about advertising. 28% growth for the year, I think you said reaching $3.4 billion. Just doing some math here. It seems like that could be adding about $300 million to $400 million in EBIT on an annual basis now. I just wanted to see if that is in the right ballpark. And what kind of magnitude of growth you're forecasting for this coming year and really the next couple of years? And also if you can just elaborate here on the vision with VIZIO as it relates to advertising."", 'John David Rainey', ""Sure, Kelly. This is John David. I'll start. We're really pleased with not just advertising, but a lot of these faster growth parts of our business. Advertising, we've called out, You noted the growth that we had for the year. We have really strong growth in the quarter. You're right, your math is right in terms of the type of contribution that we could expect there, and that segues into the conversation around VIZIO. We're really excited about that acquisition. I think it's very complementary to what we're already doing organically in that part of the business, and this is going to accelerate it. I'll turn it to Doug and John, though, to add more about that."", 'C. Douglas McMillon', ""Yes. We're not going to say too much. Obviously, we need to give that some time for the process to play out. But as John David said, we are really excited about the opportunity to bring together VIZIO's operating system with our ad platform. And we can appreciate that you all would probably have a number of questions about it. Marketplace and advertising are key drivers of profitability growth, as we've already discussed. And this acquisition accelerates the build-out of our advertising platform into the connected TV business, which will be exciting. But given that the acquisition hasn't closed, we can only reinforce what we've already shared. So we'll be limited in our remarks today. So you may want to save your questions for another topic. We want to focus for now on our quarter, on the company's strategy and more broader topics. And then we can come back to you once the deal is closed."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.', 'Robert Frederick Ohmes', ""My question is on the transaction comps. I think it was 4.3% for Walmart U.S. It's -- that's a pretty strong number and a big quarter for you guys. Can you -- a couple of things on that. Can you talk about how that kind of played out in terms of the fourth quarter? Was it more grocery driven and eCommerce driven in grocery? Or did you have really strong transaction growth year-over-year in holiday? And then in the guidance you guys have given Walmart U.S., how should we think about that transaction momentum continuing and then also probably the biggest drivers to sustaining that kind of high level of transaction growth for this year?"", 'John R. Furner', ""Robby, it's John. Let me start on this, and others can jump in. The 4.3% was -- is encouraging. We're seeing more customers. We're seeing them more often, and we're seeing a lot of new customers. The frequency John David mentioned earlier, the weekly average customers in eCommerce up 17% is a strong number. It's -- the mix hasn't changed really all that much. I think you've -- if you look at our results by business unit from consumables to food to GM, pretty similar trends than what we've been seeing. I think the big difference that we can talk about is we see more customers using same-day services and express deliveries, and that's also across a broad range of categories. That would be intuitive to assume it's food at times, like the example earlier when you're missing an ingredient. But it's -- we're also seeing this happen for birthday gifts and general merchandise items and other things. So I'd go back to what we talked about at the beginning of last year when we talked about supply chain strategy, having a short last mile is an important component in eCommerce and having stores be able to deliver what historically would have been an eCommerce order or a food delivery order or the combination of the two is really helping the brand. And additionally, that's bringing the delivery cost down, which has contributed to the improvement in operations loss in eCommerce."", 'C. Douglas McMillon', ""I think the things you've done to make it easier to pick at store level should be mentioned, too, RFID and apparel. Having the inventory levels down, so that people can find things, I think, helped us a lot when it came time to pick toys at the last minute, for example. Our accuracy, our customer scores reflect that improved accuracy. Combine that with the automation that we're putting into eCommerce fulfillment centers and you can start to see that there's a great opportunity for us to leverage math and optimize where things come from, but our accuracy is also improving."", 'John R. Furner', ""It really has, Doug. There are a few things that we're doing with technology to help us ensure that we know what we own, where it is and ensure that it's accessible for the store associates. And I can't overemphasize the importance of inventory levels being down 4.5% and what that does for a store manager, a team lead, for the coaches that are in the stores who need to take care of what a customer needs right now, and they're able to do that much more accurately. So I think it will get better over time as the automation continues to come online, but definitely some notable improvements from the store team this quarter."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.', 'Corey Tarlowe', ""I wanted to double-click on technology, and you talk about Walmart being a people-led and tech-powered company. But specifically, as it relates to AI, what is it in the last 12 months that you've deployed enterprise-wide that's worked well for the business and helped drive better returns? And then what is it over the next 12 months that you see that could really help to improve results even more going forward, as I know that's been a continued focus for the enterprise broadly?"", 'C. Douglas McMillon', ""Yes. Thanks, Corey. This is Doug, and others can chime in here and help me with this, but we're very excited about generative AI. There are big opportunities for us to improve the customer and member experience, improve associate experiences and productivity and to help take costs out of the business, and we're moving. I think big picture, we've got a very clear plan as it relates to what we want to build versus what we want to leverage from others. And we've got good partnerships and good advisers. And we've got a strong tech team that knows what they're doing in this area. So I do expect that it will have benefits. As I talk to other CEOs and we learn here, I think it's still too early to try and quantify this specifically. I think as we look back on what develops, we can probably tell you in the rearview mirror how things played out from a cost perspective, for example. But the thing we're most excited about that's already happened is the way search has improved. The way generative AI helped us really improve a solution-oriented search experience for customers and members is the thing that we're most excited about. And it happened pretty quickly. And it impacted Super Bowl search results. We gave you the example of Valentine's Day earlier. And the team is learning how to do that across all of our markets and the entirety of the company, so that's also exciting. We also rolled out something we call My Assistant on our Me@Walmart applications, so that all of our associates have access to generative AI tools and capabilities. So strategically, the way I think about it is the leadership of the company is working through where our biggest opportunities are, prioritizing and resourcing those opportunities. But we're also making generative AI available broadly, so that we get surprising good news from the way that all of our associates interact with it. Anybody else want to comment on that technology?"", 'Christopher Nicholas', ""At Sam's Club, we were really excited to unveil at CES the first of our Sam's Club's big consumer-facing applications of AI. So our easy exit process, which employs computer vision and AI to allow people to just walk out is just a really exciting way. And when you watch customers, I was in a club last week watching customers just walk out, members just walk out. And the joy that it gives them that some computer vision and AI is making their lives better without them knowing why or how is really exciting. And I think it's just the beginning of a journey in Sam's Club. We like to innovate. We have the opportunity to innovate. And we'll see opportunities for cost out, no doubt. We took 35 million tasks out of the club last year for associates by employing technology. A lot of that is artificial intelligence that helps them manage inventory better. And we're working a lot with our members, too, on personalizing how we interact with them. So we were pleased with opportunities. And I think the important thing is to choose the biggest ones and invest in those."", 'C. Douglas McMillon', 'That exit technology still requires a member to scan their items on their app. So Scan & Go is the first step. And then you can just leave the building when the transaction is completed. But obviously, eventually, we want to remove all of that part the process, too.', 'Christopher Nicholas', 'We do, we do.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.', 'Paul Lawrence Lejuez', ""You mentioned rollbacks being up versus last year. Can you quantify that and maybe talk about what percent of those rollbacks are being vendor funded, how that compares to last year as well and how that might have also compared to how you operate rollbacks historically? Also curious on which categories you're most focused on providing those rollbacks."", 'John R. Furner', ""Paul, it's John. I'll take that question. It's -- rollbacks are one of the programs we used in the Walmart format. It's up around 50% of last year, which is similar to what we reported in the third quarter. As far as categories, it's pretty evenly spread across the box. If you go back to what we said earlier about pricing, general merchandise is negative by low single digits. So you'll see a decent number all across general merchandise. Food -- the food business has a number that are showing quite as well. It's really key items that we know that our customers have responded to well. We took our French bread back to $1, which had been $1 for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market. And we're seeing results of that running about 40% over last year, so customers immediately responded. Rotisserie chicken is another one. That price has come down by $1. Customers are responding. And then as John David said earlier, customers are being choiceful, and our customers are smart and they recognize value really well. So as prices come down, and we can show the value digitally or physically, we're seeing a lot of great responses. As far as the funding, I mean, it's always going to be a balance. Merchants have a lot of levers in their P&L from their initial margin to how they manage their inventory back to mix. In many cases, you can improve margin by selling items that are higher margin. You can take higher-margin items down and move sales to those items, and it shifts the entire mix of the category. So it's not as easy as just one simple answer. But the merchants are -- as I said earlier, they're doing a nice job of managing value for customers. They are driving rollbacks. And because of strong inventory management, we were able to save markdowns and improved gross margin on products."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays.', 'Seth Ian Sigman', ""Just reflecting on the market share gains. A lot of the commentary this past year has been focused on wins with the higher-income consumer. Just any more perspective on how that's been playing out within consumables versus discretionary categories and how you think about getting that customer really up that spending curve over time. And then, I guess, just related, if you could speak to market share trends perhaps across some of the other customer segments as well, that would be helpful."", 'John David Rainey', ""Seth, this is John David. We're pleased with what we've seen in market share gains. In the quarter, we gained share in virtually every category. But notably, one of the biggest contributors in the quarter was in this income demographic from households that make more than $100,000 a year. So general merchandise as an example, 2/3 of the share gain that we had in the quarter was through this income demographic and digital channels. And what that illustrates, I think, broadly, is that our value for convenience is every bit as much -- every grade is what it is for price. And that resonates to people, regardless of the size of your paycheck. And so that's one of the reasons we think that we're gaining share. Our value proposition is resonating with customers, and they're clearly shopping us in new ways and -- versus how they have historically."", 'Kathryn J. McLay', ""I'd also just comment on some of the other markets that we're into. Looking at the market share gains that we've got really closely correlate with the improvements we've seen in NPS as well as price gap. So I think as we look at just being really relevant from a value perspective, in markets we're seeing that the consumer is responding with improvements in traffic and also in market share."", 'John R. Furner', ""And there are so many things, Seth, in there. But what customers want, they want a great price, they want a great assortment, they want value, they want experience. And we've been talking about for a couple of years the flexibility that we can offer that we couldn't -- or did not years ago. And the stores are a very important part of the eCommerce solution, including delivery, but also picking and, at times, just being exactly what they are, which are great stores that offer those four elements. So remaining flexible is going to be really important in saving people time. John David mentioned convenience, and that is definitely a driver of the results."", 'Operator', ""At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks."", 'C. Douglas McMillon', ""Thanks for joining us today. I'm a little concerned that I'm going to be boring in my closing remarks because we're becoming quite repetitive. We're in execution mode, and the headlines are we believe we can grow. We're confident in our ability to grow because we're positioned to serve customers and members however they want to be served. We can provide value, and we can provide convenience. And underneath the supply chain is changing to be more intelligent, more connected, more automated, and that's just going to help us improve execution. From a profit point of view, we can grow profit faster than sales while investing in our associates, while investing in our business and having flexibility on price if we need it. And we'll do that through the combination of business mix, the productivity delivered by automation. We're in a great set of countries. We can sell food, we can sell general merchandise, whatever the customer wants in the moment. And then thirdly, we can grow ROI over time. I think we're investing in the right categories. We're very clear on the places where we're investing. We know what the expected returns are there. It's great to see the automation plans continuing to scale. We're in a period of time here over the next few years where that's going to be vital. But it doesn't last forever, and there's a transition on the other side and it looks quite exciting to us. So I think the combination of growth, profit growing faster than sales and ROI look attractive here, and we'll just keep trying to get better as we execute it. Thanks again for your time."", 'Operator', ""This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.""]"

China is expected to be the largest economy in the world by 2040 with a forecasted real GDP of $34.10 trillion. The United States will drop to the second spot with a forecasted real GDP of $32 trillion. Though economic power is transferring from the US to China, the land of opportunities will remain an important player in the global economy. In September 2023, the US Census Bureau posted a poverty report in which it highlighted that the official poverty rate of the US in 2022 was 11.5%, representing approximately 37.9 million people in poverty. The poverty rate in the US was not much different from 2021, which was 11.6% that year. The supplemental poverty measure (SPM) soared to 12.4% in 2022, a rise of 4.6% from 2021. The increase in the SPM rate was the first since 2010. The official poverty rate remains higher than in the pre-pandemic era when it was 10.5% in 2019. Between 2021 and 2022, most of the demographic groups in the US did not experience significant changes in their poverty rates. Black individuals saw a decline in their official poverty rate between 2021 and 2022, dropping from 19.5% to 17.1%. While, the White and non-Hispanic White people both saw a 0.5% increase in their official poverty rate, jumping from 10% to 10.5% and 8.1% to 8.6% between 2021 and 2022, respectively.\xa0', 'Overall, the US has a diverse economy with various demographics and income brackets. According to the World Inequality Database, almost 20% of the US national income goes to the richest 1% of the population and nearly 50% of national income goes to the top 10%. The US states where the poverty rates are the lowest are a mix of the country’s demographics including the Northeast region and some from the Midwest and West. New Hampshire is the state with the lowest poverty rate of 7.2%, as per the Census Bureau’s 2022 American Community Survey. New Hampshire’s poverty rate has gone down by 28% from 10% to 7.2% in the last decade. Utah makes it to the second spot with the lowest poverty rate, with only 8.2% of its people living below the poverty line. The US states with the highest poverty rates are mostly Southern states, and some exceptions such as New York and New Mexico. Mississippi has the worst poverty level, where 19.1% or almost one-fifth of the population were living below the poverty line in 2022. The good thing is that Mississippi has experienced an improvement, over its 21.5% poverty rate in 2017.', 'The poorest cities in the US that are actually growing fast may allow you to get into the real estate market when the market is really cheap. For instance, Fort Worth, Texas, is a buyer’s market at the moment, according to the real estate listing platform, Realtor. The median listing home price in Fort Worth was $342,000 in January, falling by 2.5% year-over-year. This means that the supply of homes is greater than the demand for homes. Similarly, the real estate market in Phoenix, Arizona, is expected to grow by 3.2% by September 2024, as per Norada Real Estate Investments.\xa0', 'The 2024 housing market seems more optimistic following the Fed’s recent meetings in December and January. Mortgage rates have gone down from 8% to 6.6%. According to CoreLogic, 2024 began with more new listings compared to 2023, showing potential demand for homebuyers as they step off the sidelines. The increase in buyer demand for homes will continue to outweigh the available supply, leading to an increase in home prices.

We finished the year with same store physical occupancy at 96% as we focused on building up occupancy in the slower part of our leasing cycle. Today, the portfolio is above 96%. As expected, we saw new lease rates go negative in the quarter as they typically do. Meanwhile, renewal rates for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which was slightly above our expectations. Together, this resulted in a fourth quarter blended rate growth of positive 80 basis points.

A Wall Street Journal report in October 2023 said that a whopping 655,000 visitors arrived in Macau, the gambling mecca of the world, in the first five days of China’s long fall holiday. Latest data points show that gambling activity in Macau remained strong as 2024 started.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Gartner (NYSE:IT) we really liked what we saw.', ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Gartner:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.28 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$7.8b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, Gartner has an ROCE of 28%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Gartner ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Gartner compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Gartner here  for free."", ""Gartner is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 172% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects."", ""On a side note, Gartner's current liabilities are still rather high at 48% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower."", ""To bring it all together, Gartner has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And a remarkable 215% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence."", ""If you'd like to know about the risks facing Gartner, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of."", 'High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.', 'Have feedback on this article?

That's supposed to slow this year. So you're not supposed to see those record production numbers from December 2023 until now until 2025. So that should also lift oil prices and the SPR. The US is refilling the Strategic Petroleum reserve.

Let's bring in Kim Fustier, HSBC oil Gas Research director, to discuss how to navigate the energy space. Kim, it's good to talk to you today. Are there additional tailwinds here that could push the profits higher, or is this as good as it gets?"", ""KIM FUSTIER: Thanks for having me on the show. I think, as always, oil and gas prices will be really key to the sector outlook. If you look at consensus for Brent this year, it's already about $82, which is bang in line with spot prices. So right now, we can't count on earnings upgrades to lift the sector higher."", ""In the near term, we do think oil prices can be supported around current levels or even rise if there's further escalation in the Middle East. That said, let's not forget that OPEC has ample spare capacity, over 5 million barrels a day, and that should cap the upside maybe around 85 or $90."", ""In the second half of the year, in fact, we expect oil prices to slide back under $80 when OPEC and Saudi Arabia bring volumes back to the market. I think I should also mention another downside risk for the sector, which is natural gas prices. Prices in Europe have fallen back to almost normal levels just two years after the 2022 energy crisis and that's really surprised us. Also, in the US, natural gas prices have cratered recently because of warm weather."", ""But if you take a step back, in this environment, it's still a very solid macro environment for the oil and gas companies. And they're still able to return a 10% total distribution yield, including dividends and buybacks. Balance sheets are in pretty good shape, so companies are able to absorb short-term macro volatility."", '- And so Kim, with that in mind then, who are your top picks? Your top three picks here in the oil sector.', ""KIM FUSTIER: The energy sector as a whole is cheap and unloved and so we would expect the sector to rerate if the companies are able to demonstrate good performance quarter after quarter. Our top three picks are BP, Shell, and Chevron. So, for BP and Shell, we think there are good rate of change stories. They've got new leadership teams."", 'BP surprised positively at Q4 results by giving much more visibility and stability in its quarterly buyback program. Shell is also executing better and becoming more consistent. And then Chevron, we think, is a good growth story where its organic growth has been further boosted by the Hess acquisition, and it trades at a decent discount to Exxon.', '- Kim, the broader narrative within the industry has really been about this transition or whether, in fact, there will be a significant transition away from fossil fuels. You named BP as one of your picks there. I mean, this is one of those companies that has been more aggressive in that transition into clean energy under previous leadership with Bernard Looney. Is that diversification important as you assess where these companies are going to proceed, at least in the medium term? How significant a headwind or tailwind does that provide?', ""KIM FUSTIER: I think if we take a step back, global oil and gas demand is still growing. We can see that in the statistics. And so, despite continued pressure from ESG investors, particularly in Europe, the European majors, including BP and Shell, recognize that. And so they have to strike the right balance, really, between being forward leaning, investing into clean energy but also making sure that they've got viable businesses and continuing to invest in oil and gas."", ""And that's exactly why you've seen both BP and Shell tilting back towards growth in oil and gas, at least in the medium term for the next two, three, four years and then at the same time pulling back from renewables but not abandoning the renewables altogether.

The bank did a similar exercise in 2021 when the proportion of employees who felt that inflation was increasing faster than their salaries was 58%.\xa0', 'This increase in the proportion of employees viewing the cost of living rising faster than their salaries indicates that inflation is increasingly affecting people in the country. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) realized this and took steps in the right direction to provide relief to its employees. It raised its salaries despite high inflation and increased the minimum wage of workers working for it from $22 to $23 per hour. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) also announced plans to increase the minimum wage to $25 per hour by 2025.\xa0', 'Just before the pandemic, Amazon.com, Inc.

High levels of inflation in the United States also lead to higher interest rates, since the governments want to restrict the money supply in the country. However, higher interest rates in the United States, in turn, increase the cost of living in developing countries.\xa0"", 'Currently, oil is priced in dollars, which is why countries have to rely on their dollar foreign exchange reserves to buy oil.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Microsoft insiders own 0.03% of the company, worth about US$1.0b.

Over the previous four years, all three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years. It's been a dizzying ride at times that demonstrates the unpredictability of short-term moves in the stock market."", ""But it's also an excellent reminder that Wall Street is a bona fide wealth-building machine over the long run. Even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 have motored to fresh all-time highs in 2024, deals can always be found with some digging."", ""What's particularly great about putting your money to work in the stock market is that most online brokers have torn down barriers that previously kept retail investors on the sidelines. Minimum-deposit requirements and commission fees for common-stock transactions on major U.S. exchanges have largely been eliminated. This means any amount of money -- even $400 -- can be the perfect amount to put to work."", ""If you have $400 ready to invest, and you're absolutely certain you won't need this cash to pay your bills or cover emergency expenses as they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first amazing stock that investors can confidently put $400 to work in right now is FAANG component Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Alphabet is the parent of search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and burgeoning cloud-infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, among other ventures.', ""The biggest challenge a company like Alphabet faces is that it's cyclical and tied to the advertising industry. Last year, approximately 76% of its $86.3 billion in total sales came from ads via Google search, Google Network, and YouTube."", ""It's no secret that advertisers are quick to pare back their spending at the first hint of trouble with the U.S. and/or global economy. If certain money-based metrics prove accurate and a U.S. recession does take shape sometime in 2024, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Alphabet's ad segment struggle a bit."", ""The thing is, there's a big difference between recessions and an expanding economy. Whereas all 12 recessions since the end of World War II have lasted 18 months or less, two expansions alone have reached the decade mark. Patience tends to pay off handsomely with innovative ad-driven businesses."", 'Moreover, Alphabet has a clear-cut competitive advantage with Google. In January, it accounted for almost 91.5% of worldwide internet search share. Having a practical monopoly in internet search has ensured rock-solid ad-pricing power for the company and allowed this foundational segment to turn into a reliable cash cow.', ""But Alphabet's long-term growth story is more about what's going on with its ancillary operations. In particular, Google Cloud accounts for 10% of global spending for cloud infrastructure service, and the segment has delivered four consecutive quarters of operating income following multiple years of losses."", ""Cloud service margins tend to be considerably higher than advertising margins, which suggests this segment could be Alphabet's core cash-flow driver by the latter half of the decade."", 'The final puzzle piece is that Alphabet is historically cheap. Despite averaging a multiple of 18 times cash flow over the previous five years, investors can buy shares of Alphabet for just 12.6 times forecast cash flow in 2025.', ""A second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought with $400 right now is online-services marketplace Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR)."", ""Similar to Alphabet, Fiverr's stock and operating performance tend to be tied to the health of the U.S. economy. Since Fiverr's marketplace is designed to help businesses locate freelancers and purchase their services, a healthy labor market is needed. If the U.S. economy dips into a recession, the unemployment rate is likely to rise. This would be bad news for Fiverr over the short run."", 'But just as I pointed out with Alphabet, Fiverr benefits from extended periods of growth in the U.S. economy. While nine of the aforementioned 12 recessions since the end of World War II resolved in under a year, most periods of expansion have lasted multiple years. This is an environment where businesses focused on the job market can thrive over long periods.', ""Another macro factor working in Fiverr's favor is the shift we've witnessed in the labor market due to the pandemic. Though some workers have returned to the office, far more people are working remotely. This perfectly ties into Fiverr's long-term expansion and its freelancer-driven online services marketplace."", ""On a company-specific basis, the uniqueness of Fiverr's platform stands out. While most of its competition allows freelancers to price their services at an hourly rate, Fiverr freelancers are listing their tasks as an all-inclusive price. The price transparency offered by the company has clearly resonated with buyers, as evidenced by spend per buyer continuing to climb."", ""Yet the top selling point for Fiverr might just be its take rate -- i.e., the percentage of each deal, including fees, that it gets to keep. Whereas most of its peers have take rates in the mid to high teens, Fiverr's has expanded to 31.3%, as of Sept. 30, 2023."", ""It's been able to take a bigger piece of the pie, yet isn't losing freelancers or buyers. This is a recipe for sustained long-term growth and higher margins."", 'The third no-brainer stock to buy with $400 right now is pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).', 'The problems at Walgreens are well documented. Increased pharmacy competition from online retailers, coupled with the high costs of horizontal expansion, weighed on results. Recently, the company nearly halved its dividend, which ended a 47-year streak of base annual payout increases.', ""Though Walgreens' turnaround isn't going to take shape overnight, it does have the tools and leadership to deliver in a big way for patient shareholders."", ""As with any turnaround, cost efficiency is important. After easily reaching its mark of $2 billion in annual cost savings a year ahead of schedule in fiscal 2021, the company is now targeting $4.1 billion in aggregate cost savings. It's also considering the sale of specialty pharmacy segment Shields Health Solutions, which would lower the company's costs and likely improve its operating cash flow."", ""However, shrinking costs is only part of the story. Although Walgreens Boots Alliance isn't the growth story it once was, there are needle-moving catalysts in place. For instance, the company is spending aggressively on various digitization initiatives to streamline its supply chain, as well as to promote direct-to-consumer purchases. Even though online sales represent only a small percentage of net sales, it's a segment that can lead to sustained, above-average organic growth."", ""Furthermore, it's finally focusing its efforts on vertical expansion. Specifically, it has made a big shift into healthcare services."", ""A major investment in VillageMD will see the duo open 1,000 full-service health clinics in Walgreens' stores in 30 U.S. markets by the end of 2027. Being physician-staffed is a differentiator that should lead to repeat visits and increase foot traffic into its stores."", ""Don't overlook the importance of Walgreens' new CEO, either. Tim Wentworth, who officially took the reins in October, has a long history of working in the healthcare field, which was something Walgreens' preceding CEO, Rosalind Brewer, lacked."", ""Lastly, the valuation makes sense. Investors right now would be paying just 6 times forward-year earnings for Walgreens Boots Alliance stock, and they're receiving a 4.5% yield. That's a heck of a deal for a time-tested and profitable company in the healthcare space."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$107 and falling to the lows of US$91.77. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Starbucks' current trading price of US$93.46 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Starbucks’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' See our latest analysis for Starbucks ', 'According to our valuation model, Starbucks seems to be fairly priced at around 15% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Starbucks today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $110.51, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. In addition to this, Starbucks has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Starbucks' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 43%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SBUX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SBUX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

The quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, Host Hotels’ adjusted FFO per share surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed in the remaining period, the average beat being 7.17%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:', 'Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

These properties are strategically located in central business districts of major cities with proximity to airports and resort/conference destinations, driving demand.The improvement in group travel demand and business transient demand — led by the healthy demand from small and medium-sized businesses — have aided occupancy and hotel revenue per available (RevPAR) growth over the past few quarters. This trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly RevPAR stands at $200.41, indicating an increase of 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for the average occupancy rate is pegged at 68.87%, suggesting an improvement from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of 65.70%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HST’s quarterly revenues is presently pegged at $1.30 billion, implying growth of 2.83% from the prior-year period’s reported figure.Host Hotels’ strategic capital allocations to improve its portfolio quality and strengthen its position in the United States, where it has a greater scale and competitive advantage, are likely to have given it an edge and driven margin expansion.However, moderating leisure travel demand and rates at the company’s resorts and a slower-than-anticipated return of group and business travel are anticipated to have cast a pall on the company’s quarterly performance to some extent. Also, lower inbound international travel might have been a concern for Host Hotels.Further, higher interest expenses are expected to have been a spoilsport. We expect fourth-quarter 2023 interest expenses to rise 9.2% year over year.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to garner analysts’ confidence.

This is based on the company’s projection for comparable hotel RevPAR of $210-$213. Host Hotels expected comparable hotel RevPAR growth in the band of 7.25-8.75% from the prior year. It maintained the midpoint at 8% despite the impact of the wildfires in Maui, which is expected to persist in the fourth quarter, and continued macroeconomic concerns.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AFFO per share is pegged at $1.92.

(NYSE:LUV) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 27th of March, with investors receiving $0.18 per share. This payment means that the dividend yield will be 2.1%, which is around the industry average.', ""While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Southwest Airlines' stock price has increased by 37% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield."", ' View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines ', ""Unless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Before making this announcement, Southwest Airlines was paying out a fairly large proportion of earnings, and it wasn't generating positive free cash flows either. Generally, we think that this would be a risky long term practice."", 'According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 31% which is fairly sustainable.', ""The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.16 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.72. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 16% per annum over that time. It is great to see strong growth in the dividend payments, but cuts are concerning as it may indicate the payout policy is too ambitious."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Over the past five years, it looks as though Southwest Airlines' EPS has declined at around 29% a year. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable."", ""In summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Southwest Airlines' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The track record isn't great, and the payments are a bit high to be considered sustainable. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

(NYSE: GPN) today announced the pricing of its previously announced offering of $1.75 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2031 (the ""Convertible Notes""). The Company granted the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the Convertible Notes are issued, up to an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. The offering is expected to close on February 23, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.', 'The Convertible Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company, and interest will accrue at a rate of 1.50% per annum from February 23, 2024 and will be payable semi‐annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2031, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Prior to December 1, 2030, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The Convertible Notes will be convertible, on the terms set forth in the indenture, into cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. The conversion rate will initially be 6.3710 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $156.96 per share of the Company’s common stock). The initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes represents a premium of approximately 20% to the $130.80 closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 20, 2024. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or the Company’s delivery of a notice of redemption, the Company will increase, in certain circumstances, the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event or notice of redemption, as the case may be.', 'The Company may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to March 6, 2028. The Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Convertible Notes, at its option, on or after March 6, 2028, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.', 'If the Company undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes in principal amounts of $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The fundamental change repurchase price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.', 'The Company estimates that the aggregate net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $1.72 billion (or approximately $1.96 billion if the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes in full), after deducting estimated initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.', 'In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes or their respective affiliates and certain other financial institutions (the ""option counterparties""). The Company intends to use $222.25 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $228.90 per share, which represents a premium of 75% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock of $130.80 per share on February 20, 2024, and will be subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. If the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, the Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional Convertible Notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties.', 'The Company expects to use approximately $185.1 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock from purchasers of the Convertible Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected with or through one of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes or its affiliate. The purchase price per share in such transactions will equal $130.80, the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock on February 20, 2024. These repurchases may have increased, or prevented a decrease in, the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Convertible Notes concurrently with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, and may have resulted in a higher effective conversion price for the Convertible Notes. The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings and any accrued and unpaid interest under its commercial paper program, and also to repay borrowings and any accrued and unpaid interest under its revolving credit agreement, and any prepayment premium, penalty or other amount, if any, due in connection with any such repayment, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt.', 'The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon conversion of any Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.', 'In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Company expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling shares of the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date for the capped call transactions or following any termination of any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect holders’ ability to convert the Convertible Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following any conversion of the Convertible Notes or during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that holders of the Convertible Notes will receive upon conversion of such Convertible Notes.', 'The offer and sale of the Convertible Notes, and any shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), or any state securities laws, and neither the Convertible Notes nor any shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes may be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. The Convertible Notes were offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act.', 'This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, including the Convertible Notes or Global Payments’ common stock, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.', 'About Global Payments', 'Global Payments Inc.

The higher this score, the higher the movie ranks on our list. As a tie-breaker, we used the ratings of movies on IMDB.

The company saw higher unit costs in the third quarter partly due to lower gold sales volumes. However, it is expected to have benefited from lower unit costs from higher production volumes in the fourth quarter. Our estimate for all-in-sustaining costs stands at $1,326 per ounce, which indicates a sequential decline of 7%.Meanwhile, gold had a solid fourth quarter on the back of strong safe-haven buying due to geopolitical tensions in Israel. Gold prices hit an all-time high in early December, surpassing $2,100 per ounce for the first time on expectations of U.S. monetary policy easing and a weak U.S. dollar. Prices were also supported by the Israel-Hamas conflict, which boosted the demand for safe-haven assets. Prices of the yellow metal eventually racked up a solid gain of roughly 11% for the December quarter.The impacts of higher gold prices are expected to reflect on Newmont’s results in the fourth quarter.

The polls currently show a tight race, though Biden’s approval ratings have slipped since his victory in 2020. There’s ample time for that to change before November 2024 – if the economy stays strong under Democratic policies, Biden could regain his edge.', 'I’m not here to make election predictions. But it’s wise for investors looking to make strategic investments to game out various scenarios. If the Democrats pull off another win, what stocks should be on your shopping list? Which companies and sectors stand to benefit from four more years of Biden’s plans and priorities?', 'I’ll share seven stocks worth snatching up if you think Team Blue will hold the White House. These aren’t partisan picks – just smart bets based on where Biden and the Democrats plan to steer the economy. I’ll look at stocks poised to profit from continued government spending on infrastructure and climate initiatives.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Of course, I’ll have another article soon for investors betting on a potential Republican win.

The Justice Department is throwing sand in Trump’s gear, so nothing is crystal clear yet.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'If you are a long-time Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investor, the company’s latest earnings report was likely a disappointment for you. Revenue missed estimates, and the company’s quarterly net profits declined sequentially due to production and delivery challenges. However, I believe too many investors are overly pessimistic about Tesla’s future prospects.', 'It’s true that rising interest rates have dampened demand for big-ticket items like EVs. Tesla also faces intensifying competition, especially in China. Yet, with just 1% EV adoption in the massive U.S. auto market, Tesla retains tremendous room for growth in its home territory over the long-run. Once interest rates decline and macro conditions improve, pent-up demand for Tesla vehicles could drive surging sales.', 'Currently, being able to buy TSLA stock under $200 per share seems like a bargain to me. This is a revolutionary company leading the sustainability revolution. Even with near-term headwinds, few can match Tesla’s brand power, vertically-integrated structure, and software/AI expertise. Tesla holds the technology to eventually offer an autonomous ride-hailing network that is far more profitable than selling vehicles.', 'I’m also bullish because Democrats overtly favor EVs and clean energy incentives. So, policy tailwinds could strengthen considerably if a Democrat retakes the Presidency in 2024. Betting against Tesla has proven foolish time and again. I believe investors with a five-to-ten-year horizon will be rewarded handsomely buying TSLA stock at today’s depressed valuations.', 'Source: T.

Its stock has plunged over 32% from its highs. Yet, I spy a golden buying opportunity for solar stocks, and FSLR stock is one I’m including in this bunch.', 'As mentioned already, Democrat administrations strongly back renewable energy development, with solar and wind at the forefront. If a Democrat retakes the White House in 2024, expansive climate incentives could supercharge solar adoption. Even under divided governance, ongoing cost efficiencies will continue, making solar ever more cost-competitive for households and businesses.', 'In the company’s third quarter, First Solar delivered 27.4% revenue growth. Analysts forecast 33% revenue growth for all of 2023, with strong profitability to follow. The company’s superb 33.5% net profit margin is due partly to generous government solar subsidies, and I think those subsidies are unlikely to disappear anytime soon.

Its systems are gaining share by maximizing solar efficiency in residential and commercial markets.', 'Like its peers, Enphase faces demand uncertainty in today’s macro environment. Its stock slid 60% from peak levels as part of the broader selloff in equities and higher-multiple tech names. Yet, with ENPH stock having cratered, the company’s risk/reward now looks far more positively-skewed.', 'Assuming Democrats regain power in 2024, Enphase is set to benefit enormously, given the Biden administration’s generous stance toward renewable energy credits and incentives. Even more impactful could be the passage of a nationwide clean electricity standard accelerating the shift from fossil fuels. Regardless of policy shifts, U.S. solar capacity will likely increase by 38% this year.', 'Enphase aims to keep gross margins near 40% in 2024 while reversing its sales downturn.

Thus, I think this beaten-down clean energy stock appears primed for upside once growth visibility improves.', 'Source: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com', 'ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) has not had the prettiest stock chart recently. This EV charging company still operates at a loss and relies heavily on government funding to finance growth. This has led to dilution for current shareholders, and a stock price that has plummeted nearly 96% from its 2021 peak.', 'However, the pace of decline has slowed recently, after a very tough 2022/2023. CHPT stock has been trading relatively flat since last November, and I don’t anticipate it breaking below the $2 level soon, barring an economic black swan. With $367 million in cash reserves available today, ChargePoint should have enough capital to finance operations for a couple of quarters without requiring further dilution.', 'More government stimulus could prove to be the catalyst that kicks ChargePoint’s growth into overdrive. Just last month, we got word of $623 million in new federal grants for EV charging networks. Consider that a drop in the bucket relative to what’s truly needed to build nationwide infrastructure for mass EV adoption. If the Democrats retain the White House, expect billions more to flow into this still-nascent industry. ChargePoint’s first-mover status in EV charging could pay off in a big way.', 'This stock might look ugly today, but future prospects remain bright if infrastructure spending keeps growing under president Biden.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Alongside the clean energy and EV sectors, the Biden administration has nurtured another sector – defense. Regional wars and geopolitical tensions have escalated over the past two years, with no signs of cooling anytime soon. The U.S. has flooded battlefield allies with American-made weapons and vehicles. A Democrat victory would likely perpetuate this foreign policy agenda and sustain the torrent of money flowing into the military-industrial complex.', 'That bodes especially well for General Dynamics (NYSE:GD). This defense giant manufactures cutting-edge ships, combat vehicles, weapons systems, and information technology for the Pentagon and allies abroad. General Dynamics’ revenue nudged up 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023, while operating profit saw a 5% bump. However, the G700 Gulfstream business jet certification delays did create a slight drag on its results. The company still churned out $3.8 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2023, with a superb 115% cash conversion rate. Expect delayed G700 deliveries to shift into 2024, powering earnings growth. And don’t forget – General Dynamics’ backlog expanded to a towering $93.6 billion.', 'The company paid $1.4 billion in dividends last quarter alone, and anticipate another $4 billion in share buybacks this coming fiscal year. General Dynamics also used $434 million of this cash to repurchase shares, ending 2023 with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.

As one of the primary arms suppliers for NATO forces and allies, Lockheed has cultivated strong international demand. With military tensions escalating globally, defense spending is skyrocketing across Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Much of that budget increase directly benefits Lockheed.', 'Unlike Russia and China, NATO military doctrine relies heavily on aerial combat operations. That strategic focus prompts member countries to invest disproportionately more in fighter jets and missiles than ground vehicles or naval assets. In other words – the world needs Lockheed Martin’s specialty now more than ever. Despite a slight drop in FY23 revenue and earnings due to one-time impacts, Lockheed achieved a record-high $160.6 billion backlog last quarter. Free cash flow also nudged up to $1.66 billion.', 'This defense titan continues funneling capital back to shareholders, even amid macro uncertainties. Last year, the company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. The stock now trades at reasonable valuation levels compared to historical norms. Expect expanded production of Lockheed’s stealthy F-35, plus elevated demand for tactical missiles like the Hellfire and Javelin. Geopolitical crises show no signs of abating anytime soon. With a new Cold War brewing, Lockheed Martin promises strong, steady growth regardless of election outcomes.', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) may not seem the most exciting stock pick these days. This vaccine giant benefited immensely from taxpayer support through Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer’s share price skyrocketed to nearly $60/share at its peak. But with the pandemic fading and underwhelming demand for boosters, Pfizer has retreated more than 54% from its highs.', 'Don’t let the recent slide fool you, though. Pfizer remains a dominant force in the healthcare arena. Excluding pandemic products, the company still delivered 7% year-over-year operational sales growth in 2023. While Covid-19 vaccine revenue will continue fading, Pfizer’s core pharmaceutical business shows enduring strength thanks to new product launches.', 'Management guided for another 6%-8% operational sales expansion in 2024, plus ~11% adjusted earnings per share growth. Pfizer’s robust pipeline and diverse portfolio should power top-line strength for years, making the current valuation look rather tempting. Shares trade at just 12-times forward earnings estimates – dirt cheap by historical benchmarks.', 'Rising free cash flow generation also enables Pfizer’s generous capital return programs.

Moving to slide 3, we're very pleased to report our strong financial and operating results in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023. These results are driven by our two leading differentiated drug delivery technologies in hand in our auto-injectors and also by our two commercial product designs that and Hylenex. Moving to Slide 4. For 2023, we delivered a 26% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $829 million and reached a record $448 million in royalty revenue, which represents a 24% year-over-year increase. Strong operational performance drove another year of double-digit earnings growth with adjusted EBITDA increasing 19% to $426 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 25% to $2.77 for the full year 2023. We also deployed $400 million to shareholders through share repurchases, reflecting strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation priorities. Moving to slide 5, our achievements and our partner progress in 2023 contributed to the strong performance and pave the path for our strong long-term outlook. The total number of enhanced commercial products increased in 2023 from five to seven with the approval of Agennix is five car high Trudeau for generalized myasthenia gravis in the US and Europe and the approval of Tecentriq subcutaneous in Great Britain. We also had multiple positive Phase three data readouts supporting regulatory submissions for approval of enhanced subcutaneous formulations. We call that we have 100% success rate for approval of products delivered subcutaneously with Enhanze when the Phase three trials have met their endpoints, I've got a Tullow Phase three data and CIDP. was the first positive Phase three readout. And upon approval creates an expanded commercial opportunity in a condition where there is high unmet need today, Agennix have already submitted the supplemental BLA for this indication using a priority review voucher, which would support a potential approval by midyear of 2024. We were also very excited with the positive data announcements from two additional wave three products, Roche's ocrelizumab subcutaneous with Enhanze and Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab subcutaneous with enhanced supporting global regulatory submissions and potential launch in 2024 for ocrelizumab subcu and in 2025 for nivolumab subcu. We also continue to advance and expand our pipeline. Johnson & Johnson presented data at Asco from the Phase one amivantamab subcu with ENHANCE trial. An important observation that was highlighted was a dramatically lower rate of infusion-related reactions with the subcutaneous at 16% compared to 67% reported with intravenous amivantamab switches commercializes riba events. Infusion related reactions can include mild symptoms such as chills breadth of this and nausea, but can also be severe making this reduction if confirmed in Phase three study very meaningful to physicians. We are delighted that Johnson & Johnson recently announced strong progress with the Phase three study that the project will support submission of regulatory filings in 2024 for subcutaneous amivantamab with ENHANCE, another significant achievement was ViiV advancing testing of their broadly neutralizing antibody N. six LS. for HIV. Also in 2023, we reached an important milestone for our new high-volume auto-injector as we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of administering a subcutaneous injection of 10 milliliters of a representative biologic immune globulin 10% with Enhanze in approximately thirty seconds using our high volume autoinjector. And we were pleased adding new enhanced partner acumen pharmaceuticals in the fourth quarter. We're delighted to be working with them to develop a subcutaneous delivery option for ACU. one nine three, bringing together acumen and deep understanding of Alzheimer's and the amyloid beta oligomers with our enhanced platform. Moving now to Slide 6. With our strong track record of success and progress, as we look ahead, we have high confidence in the visibility of our revenue, and we were delighted to recently share our 2024 guidance on our 5-year financial outlook for the company for 2024. We're delighted to project continued strong growth of revenue with a guidance range of $915 million to $985 million, representing 10% to 19% year-over-year growth. Royalty revenue remains our top driver of our revenues and is projected to be $500 million to $525 million, representing growth of 12% to 17%. As a result of our disciplined approach to expense management and our business model. We are projecting adjusted EBITDA in the range of $535 million to $585 million, a remarkable 26% to 37% growth. Our focus now on the 5-year financial outlook, total revenue is projected to reach $1 billion in 2025 and grow to greater than $1.5 billion in 2027 and 2028, with royalty revenue continued to be the key driver projected at $1 billion in 2027. And impressively, we project adjusted EBITDA will grow faster than revenue in every year of the 5-year outlook to an impressive $1 billion in 2028 with a 5-year CAGR of 23%. I'll now turn to slide 7 and review royalty revenue drivers in a bit more detail. Our Wave two products, Darzalex, Sensipar and Phesgo launched in 2020 have driven the impressive royalty revenues and growth illustrated on this chart and have many years of impressive growth ahead for them. Moving now to slide 8, and to Darzalex Bass growth enabled by enhanced with subcutaneous penetration in excess of 90% in the US, total brand growth has become the key driver for understanding subcutaneous performance for this product in 2023. Total Darzalex sales continued to deliver strong growth for Johnson & Johnson, increasing approximately 23% year over year on an operational basis to $9.7 billion is strong. Growth was driven by share gains in all regions and continued growth in the first-line setting supporting future growth. And first line. It is notable to highlight that Johnson & Johnson recently submitted a supplemental BLA to the FDA to support a new indication for Darzalex Aspart with Enhanze for multiple myeloma in newly diagnosed adult patients who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplants. The results from the Perseus study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine supported this submission, the addition of DAR for expense growth to standard of care treatment resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement over today's standard of care alone and progression-free survival complete response or better and minimal residual disease negativity as we look forward, ANALYST continues to expect annual sales of Darzalex to grow to approximately $17 billion by 2028, driven in large part behind the first line opportunity. I'll move now to Phesgo, which is illustrated on Slide 9. Tesco offers the potential for patients with breast cancer to receive treatment at a simple subcutaneous injection over five minutes after the first dose at a total treatment and observation time of about 20 minutes to 38 minutes, which compares to 2.5 hours to 7.5 hours total treatment and observation time for the IV with its strong value proposition. sales gross sales continued at an impressive rate of growth in 2023, increasing 64% to CHF1.1 billion for the full year as as continued to expand into additional markets, but also driving global conversion rate higher. Roche reported a 39% conversion rate in 46 plus countries as we look at regional uptake, strong growth and contribution was reported for all regions. Us sales were CHF423 million, growing at 48% and now representing close to 40% of total revenue, a new is growing at 52%, and international was reported to be growing at greater than 150%. Roche has stated that he expects continued growth of Phesgo with increasing conversion from the IV treatment projector, which reported sales of CHF3.8 billion in 2023, which was projecting peak conversion of approximately 50%. We were excited to see the strong performance and the future growth that lies ahead for Phesgo. And then move to slide 10 and a focus on our Wave three products and product candidates. What you see in the left panel are the 2023 launches. And as you move across the slide to the right, the multiple product, regional and indication launches that are projected this year. And next, I will highlight the positive Phase three data and regulatory submissions have been reported by our partners for all products. With the exception of MMM. Dmab, it has not yet reported its Phase three data. We are very excited with the large opportunity for the Wave three, which is now comprised of five products that are projected by analysts to generate total sales of approximately $35 billion in 2028. I will start with BiPar who are treated with Enhanze, which was approved in generalized myasthenia gravis in the US in June of 2023. And in Europe in November, sidecar, a tool with enhanced offers myasthenia gravis patients in new, faster treatment delivery option delivered by health care practitioners in just 30 to ninety seconds. Notably, the European approval also allows for patient self-administration subcutaneously with the backup had truly subcutaneous launch just six months ago, our genetics focus has been on broadening commercial coverage and securing the J-code, which was accomplished in January of this year. With this, we project growing adoption from five car extra-large. The successful launch of BioSTAR with $1.2 billion in revenue in 2023 supports the unmet needs that exist for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis and the attractiveness of the Vytek, our clinical profile sidecar at Tullow has the potential to expand the number of physicians using bicarb and to expand use in the earlier lines of treatment and then move to an exciting additional opportunity for five or too low. And that CIDP. or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy based on organics, is research and recent comments, 42,000 patients receive treatment today for CIDP. It's a condition where there's a high unmet need. Just 20% of patients get remission on the current standard of care treatment and 50% of patients report that they remain dissatisfied with the current burden of symptoms, 61% reduction in risk of relapse. With fact, our HER2-low versus placebo shown in the ADHERE study would upon approval offer an important new option for patients. And I highlight that this indication will be available only as a subcutaneous treatment enabled by ENHANCE with the recent submission and use of their prior to review voucher organic projects, the possibility of approval for this new indication in the United States in mid 2024. Moving net centric to Centric as an IV remains a key growth driver for Roche, with revenue growing 9% year over year to CHF3.8 billion in 2023. Tecentriq subcutaneous with Enhanze was granted regulatory approval in Great Britain last year and in the European Union in January of 2024 for all of the approved IV indications. It is given as an approximate a seven minute subcutaneous delivery, which compares to 30 to 60 minutes for the IV infusion with UK conversion already reaching 18% essentially in one quarter. Roche believes that the opportunity for subcutaneous adoption remains significant. Us approval is projected in September of this year. Moving to offer this service as an IV is a leading treatment in the US and EU five for multiple sclerosis with more than 300,000 patients treated globally and a higher retention rate than other multiple sclerosis medicines for the full year focus has generated an impressive CHF6.4 billion, which we estimate to be about USD7 billion in revenue for Roche, which represents 13% year over year growth. Ocrelizumab subcutaneous with enhanced creates the possibility for people living with multiple sclerosis to receive their treatment and just 10 minutes twice a year, which compares to 3.5 hours to 6.5 hours for the IV treatment and observation time most commented on their recent quarterly call that they project the addition of availability of ocrelizumab subcu, which is enabled with Enhanze to create a stand-alone blockbuster opportunity. As we've seen with Darzalex subcutaneous, the availability of the subcutaneous delivery option can result in or accelerate market growth. We predict the availability of ocrelizumab subcutaneous and hence concrete increased growth in two key ways. Firstly, filing current multiple sclerosis centers to increase the number of patients treated as a result of improved throughput based on shorter time needed for each patient, occupying an infusion chair. And secondly, by expanding the number of treatment centers by enabling multiple sclerosis centers that do not have IV infrastructure today to start administering ocrelizumab subcutaneously following the completed regulatory submissions in the US, EU and U.K. in 2023, we project the approval of ocrelizumab subcutaneous to represent our eight Enhanze royalty revenue generating products in 2024. Our next wave three product is Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab subcutaneous with Enhanze, which is the brand name of Xevo as the IV Opdivo ID sales were $9 billion in 2023, increasing 9% year over year, showing continued strong growth. In January, Bristol-Myers Squibb presented the detailed results of CheckMate [60, 70]. The Phase three IV versus subcutaneous registration enabling study at SCOGI. As announced previously, the trial met the primary endpoint of noninferiority of the two co-primary endpoints see average over 28 days. And Siemens, a key powered secondary endpoint of overall response rate was also reported. Noninferiority was also demonstrated with the overall response rate of 24.2% for the subcutaneous and 18% for the IV given in just five minutes, nivolumab subcutaneous has the potential to be practice-changing and to improve the patient's treatment experience. Bristol-myers Squibb commented that the subcutaneous could potentially extend the franchise through the end of this decade and into the early 2030s, with the subcutaneous approval projected to cover up to 75% of the IV indications. And lastly, we were excited to have recently added Johnson & Johnson's amivantamab subcutaneous with Enhanze into our Wave three potential launches with the potential for launch in 2025. Johnson & Johnson recently indicated that they expect Phase three data from diploma three trial for amivantamab with Enhanze plus less active in 2024 supporting U.S. and European regulatory filings. Also in 2024, an event I-Mab is already approved as an IV under the brand name. Brian Roman with Johnson & Johnson projecting represent will become a multibillion-dollar brand. Let me now move to slide 11, where I'll provide an update on our Wave four pipeline, which is projected to support our future growth trajectory with potential launches in the 2025 to 2027 timeframe. We currently have a robust pipeline with several exciting products in development. This reflects amivantamab moving to Wave three based on the updated potential launch timing and Amgen's decision to not move forward with a subcutaneous version of capacity with enhanced Johnson & Johnson has also made the decision to not proceed with recovering subcutaneous the Wave four portfolio comprises of products across a range of therapeutic areas, including oncology, neurology, immune disease and HIV with two products in Phase three development. This included Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab with relentless mAb with Enhanze for the Phase three study is underway. The IV version of dual like is projected by analysts to be a multibillion-dollar brand in 2028. The goal with the subcutaneous version is to offer a shorter simpler treatment option, reducing patient burden and health care resources. Takeda's tech 81, which is a 20% IgG with Enhanze for primary immune deficiency is the second Phase three development program. This will be the second 20% IgG to launch and will expanded Takeda's immune global offering for patients creating a lower volume and potentially shorter treatment schedule last year, our ViiV collaboration also progressed with subcutaneous delivery of N. six LS. enabled by enhanced and six LSAC broadly neutralizing antibody for HIV, and it has advanced into a Phase IIb study in combination with paclitaxel for a two-drug regimen for HIV treatment because of the rapidly changing nature of HIV and its potential to develop resistance to certain treatments feed based on HIV community feedback has stated that there continues to be a need for medicines with unique mechanisms of action like the broadly neutralizing antibodies, which may open up a completely new approach to treating HIV. Separately, we continue to be pleased to collaborate with their genetics on ARGX. one one seven, no named and passive project. And in addition, we have two remaining programs and we four that are confidential at the request of our partners. I'll move now to Slide 12. Let me now spend a moment on our high-volume auto-injector. We were excited last year to demonstrate delivery of 10 miles of a representative biologic co-formulated with Enhanze in just thirty seconds with our innovative new high-volume auto-injector in hands is the key ingredient that makes this possible for patients that can offer the option for home delivery or rapid delivery in the physician's office. Our goal with the high-volume auto-injector offering is to expand upon established enhanced collaborations and add new collaboration partners. I'm pleased to announce that one of our current partners is initiating a human factors test of a high-volume auto-injector to evaluate device usability. This test is scheduled to start this quarter. I'll turn now to new enhanced steels. We continue to have strong and expanding interest by existing and new partners. While we were disappointed by the slow progress in decision making by companies in 2023, we remain confident in our ability to expand our pipeline in 2024. This year started with expanded interest from potential new partners with a busy schedule of meetings in January and February already with partners expressing interest in Enhanze a high volume on auto-injector and in some cases, the small-volume auto-injector technology. I look forward to providing updates on progress on new agreements throughout the year. I'll now turn to our commercial portfolio. As I said, sales achieved $100 million in 2023, demonstrating strong growth as sales attainment met our target revenue for the year and breakeven in the fourth quarter. This performance reflects successful execution of our three-pronged strategy, which includes targeting the switch of patients who are not achieving their treatment goals with intramuscular injections, enhancing adherence with specialty pharmacies, executing educational programs to support patients staying on treatment and continued actions to improve the net sales price with a market of more than 9.5 million scripts a year and our share approaching 5%. We see a clear path for continued growth in revenue and EBITDA contribution in 2024 with a key growth projection of 25% through 2028. Let me now turn the call over to Nicole, who will discuss our financial results in more detail and give Helen."", 'Nicole LaBrosse', ""The fourth quarter marked a strong end to 2023, we delivered double digit revenue growth and achieved another record quarter of royalty revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share growth outpaced the top line, reflecting the significant leverage we generate as we grow royalty revenue. Let me start with capital allocation on Slide 13. We remain committed to our three capital allocation priorities of investing in the business to maximize revenue growth and durability, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and adding new growth opportunities through M&A. In November 2023, we initiated a $215 million accelerated share repurchase or ASR. This will operate to repurchase our shares for a number of months into 2024. This brings our total share buyback since the inception of the first program in 2019 to $1.3 billion. I am also pleased to announce that our Board authorized a new $750 million repurchase program reflecting our continued commitment to balanced capital allocation and it focus on driving value for shareholders. Turning now to Slide 14 for our detailed financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 27% to $230 million compared to $181.5 million in the prior year period. Royalty revenue for the quarter was $122.1 million, an increase of 15% compared to $106 million in the prior year period, driven by continued strong performance of Wave two products, subcutaneous Darzalex and Phesgo. Note that Q4 of 2022 reflected a measurement period adjustment to amortization of intangibles to our current run rate of $17.8 million a quarter. Other operating expenses remained relatively flat period-over-period due to our leverageable business model, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 47% to $121.7 million from $83 million in the prior year period. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $336 million as of December 31st, 2023 compared to $483.3 million as of September 30th, 2023. The reduction is due to the use of $215 million for the ASR, offset by positive cash generation in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 2.5 times, and we expect to decrease net leverage each quarter with EBITDA growth. Turning now to Slide 15 for our detailed financial results for the full year 2023, I will briefly touch on some highlights here with more details available in our press release and the 10 K filed with the SEC today. Recall that we closed the Antares acquisition on May 24th, 2022. And therefore, the year-over-year comparison is impacted by a full year versus a partial year of contribution. And the interiors business, total revenue grew 26% year over year to $829.3 million in 2023 off in an already substantial revenue base in 2022 of $660.1 million the main contributor to this increase was higher revenue from royalties of $447.9 million, reflecting growth of 24% as well as higher enhanced product sales and Diastat sales growth. Also note that the revenue growth was offset by the timing of milestones recognized in the prior year. We call that the timing of the milestone for Tecentriq SD. in the US was planned for the third quarter of 2023 and is now expected in September 2020. For research and development expenses were $76.4 million compared to $66.6 million in 2022, primarily due to increased compensation expenses resulting from the addition of a new platform. Our device platform as well as planned payments and enhance selling. General and administrative expenses were $149.2 million compared to $143.5 million in 2022, primarily due to the addition of resources in sales and marketing with the addition of our commercial product sales debt, offset by one-time transaction costs related to the Antares acquisition that occurred in the second quarter of 2022 of approximately $38 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% to $426.2 million from $358.9 million in the prior year period. Gaap diluted earnings per share was $2.10 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.77. This is compared with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.44 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $2.21 in 2022. Turning now to Slide 16 and our 2024 guidance, we are reiterating our top line adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the full year 2024 that was provided in January. We are projecting another year of double digit revenue growth to $915 million to $985 million with milestones and API sales to be substantially weighted in the second half of the year. Royalties are growing to $500 million to $525 million with a flattening in the first and second quarter and growth sequentially thereafter, with royalty revenues for the year greater than 50% of total revenue. This directly impacts gross margin expansion, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 26% to 37% to $535 million to $585 million.

And second, how quickly can you deploy the $750 million share repurchase authorization? Thank you.', 'Helen Torley', ""Thanks, Jeff, I'll take the first one. We certainly are off to a great start in 2024 with a robust set of meetings and forward momentum across all of our opportunities. That concludes and hand the high-volume auto-injector and the small-volume auto-injector. And our focus has been progressing all three of these types of deals, and we're not putting a specific number on it, but we're looking to advance all of these and I look forward to updating you on that progress throughout the year. Nicole, will you tackle the question on the on the share repurchase new program?"", 'Nicole LaBrosse', 'Yes, things just so at the moment, we are actively repurchasing shares today. We call it the towards the end of 2023, we initiated a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program that operates for a number of months to book them a number of months into 2024 to buy those shares back. It is active at the moment and we were happy to announce the approval of the new program and that the purpose of that is to continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy and continue to lever utilize that to continue to look at share repurchases and into 24 and beyond.', 'Jessica Fye', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Question comes from the line of Michael DiFiore with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.', 'Michael DiFiore', 'Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on all the progress in 2023. Just two question from me. With regards to the amyloid beta target from ENHANCE. And obviously, this is a non-exclusive deal. Had there been any more partner companies that have opted into coal licenses target? And any commentary on when we might find out who the other core licensee is on separately on. I was wondering if there were any had been any development or updates the time lines for the room, temperature and high yield, how you run a days and whether any potential partners have expressed interest in this? Thank you.', 'Helen Torley', ""Thanks, Mike. Jim. With regard to amyloid beta, which obviously we were delighted last year to sign the deal with acumen and we don't have any other partner agreements we can announce with regard to that. But it continues to be an area of focus for us because we do believe there is a strong value proposition for Alzheimer's patients and being able to receive their therapy as infrequent as possible, simple subcu dose, even at home. And so we remain in active dialogue with regard to that and the company that already had the nonexclusive license use, it really is up to that partner. And I think Mike will depend on whether they are advancing in clinical development. That is not an active program at this point in time. So it really would be up to them if they did decide to disclose it at that period. Of time, but some definitely an exciting area, and we're delighted to be working with them acumen and for the room temperature stable. Just to remind everybody, this is a different version that then hands another higher on a days which has its own patent life out to 2032 in Europe in 2034 in the United States at 8 a.m. We brought forward as a possibility to use with our partners who perhaps wanted a product like a small molecule that patients would carry around with them. And obviously, the majority of our products are refrigerated today and so in hands is just perfect for that. And we have advanced the development of that to have established a new cell line for it. And we are ready to go to scale up. And we're still in conversations, although there are early conversations with at least one partner about potentially moving that forward. But so far, no decision to move forward with that, but we are ready to go to the next stage. And this is a full development. And just to give an expectation of the time line we'd expect this to be available post 2027 as there is work to be done to finish the scale-up, but also any program going through with the new room-temperature would have to go through our standard Phase one Phase three program, which an average takes about five years. So hopefully that's helpful in describing the time line for them. There are few companies interesting, I will say most people and hands is exactly what they need, and that's where we expect the majority of partners to go. But this was an additional offering. We thought might work for us, a nice small target number of opportunities, and we'll continue to talk about that."", 'Michael DiFiore', 'Great. Thanks so much.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.', 'Mohit Bansal', ""Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Two questions, if I may. One of your 10 K, there's some comment around cancellation of the past, our partnership with a horizon. If you could elaborate a little bit more. I know there was not a lot of progress made before the company got acquired by Amgen. But any comment any color you could provide there? And the second question is regarding the infusion times reaction reduction rate so far for Tecentriq and Opdivo, you're talking about [30 minutes] coming down to [5 minutes] or so. How big is the factor, I guess, infusion time reaction in terms of conversion? Does it play into Lycoming? Some conversions are more like 50% or less are versus Darzalex is up and a really high conversion story. So could you talk a little bit about that?"", 'Helen Torley', ""Yeah. And could you have a place to do that with regard to the Amgen agreement that no, with Ripasa, well, all we can say, Mohit, is that them very recently Horizon informed us that they were ending the agreement and licensing agreement with Enhanze, they didn't provide any further information. And so there's no additional information we can share on that. And as you note, that had that not been progressing out with Horizon for a period of time as we've kept everybody informed and all infusion times, I'll give a couple of examples that I think can very nicely illustrate that because clearly Darzalex is has got a marvelous some improvement for patients, not just reduction in infusion time, but also infusion related reactions. But if we look at them, two examples, I'll use Herceptin where in Europe that was launched several years on the market before biosimilars as an IV. That was about it 30 minutes to 60 minutes. And as a subcu alum, it was 5 minutes. And in that case, it got to 60% share of sales conversion in just three years. And we're seeing a very similar picture, I think with Phesgo slight difference where the IV can be as much as 2 hours to 2.5 hours. The subcu is more in the range of five to seven minutes, but again, a very nice global conversion, as I mentioned on the call already, 40% conversion, very close to that in the 46 launch countries and certainly showing strong adoption with 40% of sales. Also coming from the United States now. And so I think those are two examples that see a reduction in time from an hour-long IV to a 5-minute subcu is very attractive in the market, it helps the patient. It reduces health care costs. And I think in the world where not just outside the US, but in the U.S., we're also seeing major infusion suite capacity constraints, there is a growing desire and need to be able to have more patient throughput. And the subcu is fitting very well into that in the US and outside the US, which is why I think we're seeing such nice growth of Phesgo in all regions of the world."", 'Mohit Bansal', 'Got it. Super helpful. Thank you, Helen.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mitchell Kapoor with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open.', 'Mitchell Kapoor', ""Hey, Ron, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about your expectations for any kind of coverage barriers within that launch of subcutaneous versions of products. I guess whenever I think about Tecentriq, the impressive 18% conversion in the first quarter of launch in the UK is great. And I'm wondering more broadly view, see any kind of pushback from payers whenever you're thinking about the next products coming to life?"", 'Helen Torley', ""Yes. Mitchell, on that from a we can look to the history of what's happened with all of the products that have been launched. And we always think about these things, as I say, the U.S. and then inside the US. I think outside the US, some of the payers in Europe and in particular recognize the importance of subcu for reducing the cost of care. And then there tends to be very robust adoption. Indeed, sometimes I'm mandated conversion to subcu because of the very beneficial impact on patients and the health care system. So I would not presume any barriers at Toll outside the US and in the U.S. as well. There's always a period which we usually model is about six months where you do need to get the reimbursement and pay in place. There's automatic coverage in Medicare, but physicians like to wait for the J-code, which is now issued quarterly. So as an example, after six months, some Vicor has truly got there. So but once that J-code in place, the confidence in reimbursement increases. And so I would say just think about it as a little bit of a slow uptake for the first six months and then no real barrier. Same is true with commercial coverage. In general, our partners have priced the IV and the subcu, certainly on a wider basis. Similarly, element, as I imagine, there is also similar in market prices to the payers and what that continues to happen. And we hear and see that access is very similar achieved for the IV and subcu. So no barriers there. And you could believe that there is even an opportunity with them some thoughtful strategies to have subcu be preferred given some of the healthcare costs, and that's certainly something we are thinking about. We are beginning to talk about with payers and also talk about with them some of the government payers as well because subcu offer so many benefits to the health care system. So equal playing field to date, maybe can move to have more preferred playing field in the US in the future."", 'Mitchell Kapoor', 'Okay. Great. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jason Butler with JMP Securities. Your line is open.', 'Jason Butler', 'Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. And Two from me just following on from the comments around horizon, is there now an opportunity to see and for IGF one are in thyroid eye disease, a new exclusive license with a new party or I or is it only a nonexclusive license that becomes available with the termination of the Horizon partner shipments? Second question is just can you speak to the partnership interest on Enhanze alone versus enhanced plus any and Taras autoinjector at this point? Thank you.', 'Helen Torley', ""All right. And with the the ending of the agreement with Verizon, we actually are in a position to license the idea for one target exclusively or not exclusively depending on the partner need and interest. So we can do either Jason or in the conversations we're having today. I would say there's an equal weighting of interest and enhance and enhance the high volume auto-injector and really fit that the balances, depending on the volume of expected them drug, if it's a drug that's more than 10 amounts. Clearly, we're focused on just in hand, but we've got some interesting conversations with drugs that are more in that two to 10 ML. and that's where the conversation focuses on the combination of enhancing the high-volume auto-injector."", 'Jason Butler', 'Okay, great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Joe Cantie Zorro with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.', 'Joe Cantie Zorro', ""Everybody. Thanks for taking my question. And we just had one quick one on Takeda's IBIG. portfolio. And I guess I was wondering how we should think about High Q versus historical royalty contribution or the potential impact that it may or may not see with the CIDP. label expansion? And I guess I'm asking that because I recall seeing somewhere that CABP indication where IBIG. sees the most on use, though. Any any comments there would be helpful. Thanks."", 'Helen Torley', ""Yes, we continue to see growing royalty contribution to Halozyme from sales of QVAR. So at Takeda has certainly continued to execute and see growing adoption in the area of primary immune deficiency. I agree when we look at the market of the use of IVIG is 20% to 25% is reported to be in MCIDP. And so that certainly is a high use area it's an area where patients stay on therapy for a prolonged period of time. And we certainly would expect that the addition of this indication not just in Europe, but also in the West will offer a new growth opportunity upon approval out. Sorry, for the HyQvia and for the arm, I think you also wanted to talk about some the new 20% version. That's obviously still in development. And we are very excited to be advancing that in Phase three development with Takeda and that we're looking forward to working with Takeda to get that to approval as well and get it used in as many indications as possible."", 'Joe Cantie Zorro', ""Okay.

So as our partners move through clinical stages, we receive milestones as those targets are achieved. We also have regulatory registrational first commercial sales based milestones and then continuing sales-based milestones post the launch of a product. We also included within that range $30 million to $60 million that is related to our expectation of achieving new on new collaborations and new study starts a new programs progressing through the clinic and so that that is the pieces that make up that collaboration revenue."", 'David Risinger', 'Okay. Thanks so much. Very helpful.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Corinne Johnson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'Corinne Johnson', ""Yes, good afternoon, everyone. It's maybe a question for me on the nature of the auto-injector partnership conversations. What are some of the key questions that your potential partners are asking and where do you think they're going to have them as comfortable versus where are there any sort of consistent sticking points that you can help them work through."", 'Helen Torley', ""And I would say, and obviously, we always start. And so it's not a question, but one of the important things we always communicate is the long track record of success and the multiple approvals Our platform has attained to occur in ANTARES. Now Halozyme has delivered over 40 million devices to partners and use ourselves so that long track record of success and the track record of approvals of drug device combinations is pretty much unmatched, we believe in the industry. So we always start by making sure they understand that some that we just to have an incredible experience base. We then go on to talk about the fact that our high volume injector is based on an extrapolation of this already approved and highly reliable based autoinjector. And again, that is a source of them. I think that pleases them to hear that, that this is something that is tried and tested because what we understand is that there have been some particularly on-body injectors that have been tried over the last several years that have not delivered with the reliability that was required. And so that is a question that I have really on reliability, wanted to be sure that this some is going to be able to be delivering for the patient every time. And of course, that's another of the advantages of our ANTARES platform is that it is tested to the highest levels of reliability for several of our products like the EpiPen, and it's called the five nines of reliability, but it's 99.999% fire on-time and well. And so the biggest thing is just get them helping them understand this is them built on an incredible background platform with great experience from our engineers, track record of success with regulators. But I think the team has done over 20 human factor studies very successfully also to support regulatory filings and getting them to understand that I see that is it a large focus of the conversation. And then I mentioned in December, and I think it's still true. These are scientists. These are engineers. They want to have a chance to hold and test the device themselves and so on. That's what we're doing. But we're delighted today to announce that one of our partners is advancing in the human factors test on usability. And I think we're going to continue to see that as we are talking to partners so when that some that I think Corrine would be how I would address that question."", 'Corinne Johnson', ""Great. That was really helpful and comprehensive. And then maybe one more from me. Just you know it's been a couple of years since you did in targeted acquisition. How are you thinking about the fit for that commercial business within the broader portfolio? Is it still something you think makes sense strategically?"", 'Helen Torley', ""Yes, maybe when we did the acquisition, we talked about the commercial business as bringing a diversification of our revenue. And as some Nicole and I both talked about in the call last year, we achieved them $100 million and turned EBITDA positive at the end of the year. So beginning this year, as I said, the leading commercial product is going to be contributing to EBITDA. And as we talked about in January, is projected to exceed $150 million in EBITDA contribution by 2028. And so it is a great fit from the point of view of adding Antero revenues, diversifying our revenues, but also contributing meaningful EBITDA even on our very large revenue base that we project in 2028. So that's how we view it as in terms of the strategy fit. It is also a wonderful demonstration of the effectiveness and reliability of our small-volume auto-injectors because recall and as I said, is a once a week 10nd subcutaneous testosterone replacement that is virtually painless. And so it's a very good thing for us. To demonstrate our effectiveness in managing and delivering and autoinjectors, but also the high reliability of our device. So lots of strategic fit for it."", 'Corinne Johnson', 'Okay, great. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""There are no further questions at this time. This will conclude today's call. We thank you for joining.

With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter. [Commercial break]"", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our momentum and solid execution continued this quarter as we established a track record of consistently delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Diabetes took another step forward with double-digit growth, supported by a return to growth in the U.S. I'd also note the particular strength we saw in multiple businesses like core spine, cardiac surgery, structural heart, and cardiac pacing, and we had strong growth across international markets as we expand access to our innovative healthcare technologies all around the globe."", ""At the same time, we've had a rapid cadence of new product approvals, and we're continuing to differentially invest in our pipeline of highest growth opportunities. We're advancing innovative core technologies like robotics, AI, and closed-loop systems. And with five AI products already FDA-approved, we're leading the way in bringing the tech into medtech. We also continue to make progress on our comprehensive transformation of the company."", ""We're incorporating a performance-driven culture that's based on execution, speed, and playing to win, and we're leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies. So when you look at our financials this quarter, you're seeing the early results of our focus on restoring earnings power and converting our earnings into strong cash flow, and we're using that cash to both invest in high-return opportunities and return value to our shareholders. So we're executing, and we're delivering. And we expect to continue over the coming quarters and years, given our momentum, our ongoing transformation, our breakthrough innovation, our exposure to strong secular growth markets, and our numerous catalysts across the business."", ""Now before I get into the details of our Q3 results, I do want to mention that we provided a portfolio management update this morning on our patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses. After a comprehensive review, we have decided to exit our unprofitable ventilator product line and retain and bring together our remaining PMRI businesses into one business, which we're calling acute care and monitoring. Now we've determined it is in the best interest of Medtronic, its stakeholders, the ACM business, both near and long term, to exit vents because of its increasing unprofitability and market preference shift to lower-acuity ventilators. Now, as we exit vents, I want to recognize the strong legacy of our business and the Puritan Bennett brand, and we're committed to serving the needs of our customers and honoring our ventilator service contracts."", 'And I also want to thank the employees in our ventilator business, who played an incredible role during the pandemic to dramatically expand production, to get ventilators to the communities around the world that needed them. And while we exit, we do believe that existing manufacturers can meet the customer demand for new ventilators going forward. Now at the same time, we decided to retain and refocus the remaining PMRI businesses. Three main factors have driven this decision.', ""First, we have strong conviction in our ability to lead and drive growth in acute care and monitoring, given our improved competitive position and our ability to properly fund this business with savings from exiting vents. Second, the importance of data in this space is changing rapidly. It's becoming the basis of innovation, and this fact further improves our competitive differentiation. And lastly, as a company, more broadly, we continue to prioritize profitable, innovation-driven growth and category leadership, and ACM can deliver both."", ""That does not mean we will shy away from additional portfolio moves going forward, but the bar is high for any strategic activity that dilutes our focus on our profit and growth. So when you take these decisions together, we're able to provide increased investment for acute care and monitoring, using the savings from vents and bringing two businesses together, all without creating dilution to our P&L. Now let's get into the details behind our Q3 results. We continue to look at our portfolio in three categories: established market leaders, synergistic, and highest-growth businesses."", 'In this quarter, all three grew in line with our expected growth algorithm. Our established market leader and synergistic businesses grew mid-single digits, while our highest growth businesses posted high single-digit growth, and we expect their contribution to our overall growth to further accelerate in the quarters ahead. Now looking first at the established market leaders. Combined, they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 4%.', ""Starting with cranial and spinal technologies. We're driving consistent above-market growth on the continued adoption of our AiBLE ecosystem. CST delivered high single-digit growth in core spine, mid-teens growth in biologics, and high single-digit growth in enabling technology. We had strong double-digit unit growth in Stealth Station navigation, O-arm imaging, and Mazor robotic systems, a leading indicator for future growth in this business."", ""We also continue to see strong adoption of UNiD adaptive spine intelligence, our integrated, AI-based surgical planning solution. Now, with AiBLE, we're offering a complete, robust ecosystem of enabling technologies and associated implants for spine surgeons. Our global footprint, which includes over 10,000 systems, is over four times greater than the nearest competitor. And with this scale and extensive and rapidly increasing install base, we're transforming the spine industry."", ""We're leading the way as more surgeons adopt our integrated spine technologies. And in an environment where there is disruption from consolidation, we're attracting the best sales teams to Medtronic to grow and expand our business. Next in surgical, we grew 3%. Our wound management business won share, growing in the high teens on the strength of our V-Loc barbed sutures."", 'We also had solid mid-single digit growth in hernia products as we won share in synthetic permanent mesh with our ProGrip platform. And as expected, our surgical growth continue to have a modest impact from declines in bariatric surgery. Now we still believe this impact will be temporary as more patients become eligible for surgery and as patients seek a more permanent treatment to weight loss. To wrap up our established market leaders, cardiac rhythm also grew 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in cardiac pacing.', ""Our Micra leadless pacemakers continued to post strong results, growing 15%, driven by the launch of our next-generation Micra AV2 and VR2 devices. We're also benefiting from the adoption of conduction system pacing, an alternative to traditional single or dual-chamber pacing. Our 3830 lead, the only one on the market approved for conduction system pacing, continued to grow strong double digits. In CRM."", ""We also began training and the limited launch of our Aurora EV-ICD. Now we expect the EV-ICD to reaccelerate our defibrillation solutions growth in the coming quarters. As I've shared with you in the past, Aurora is a game changer in the ICD space. It delivers the benefits of a traditional ICD, including similar size, longevity, and pacing features, but without the leads in the harder veins, and these benefits can be realized with one device and only one implant procedure."", ""We expect our advantages will not only displace the competitors' device, we will expand the population far beyond the existing segment and be a strong growth driver for CRM. Now turning to our synergistic businesses. Combined, they grew mid-single digits in Q3, and I'll highlight some of the drivers here. Let's start with aortic, which grew 13% on supply recovery and continued momentum of our Endurant AAA franchise."", 'Cardiac surgery grew 10%, driven by strength in perfusion and cannula, and ECLS oxygenators, given competitor quality issues; and the strong sales in international markets of our Avalus surgical valve. Coronary grew 7%, driven by double-digit growth in both guide catheters and balloons, and we increased our drug-eluting stent share in the U.S. and in Europe on the continued rollout of our Onyx Frontier drug-eluting stent. Now turning to businesses in our highest-growth markets.', ""As I mentioned earlier, together, these businesses grew in the high single digits this quarter, and we expect their contribution to our growth to accelerate going forward. Now diabetes led the way, growing double digits on the global adoption of our game-changing MiniMed 780G system. We're seeing strong sequential momentum, growing 5% over the prior quarter. Our customer base is growing sequentially, and we're driving more revenue per customer."", 'In the U.S., we not only return to growth, we grew mid-single digits, driven by nearly 50% revenue growth in insulin pumps. We doubled our new users year over year, attracting those on multiple daily injections, as well as users of competitor systems. Users are choosing 780G for the outcomes it delivers. With intensive insulin users, these outcomes matter, and the 780G is highly differentiated.', ""It's the only AID system to automatically adjust and correct sugars every five minutes. It offers flexible glucose targets as low as 100 and features our proprietary meal detection technology. This leads to high time and range for users, and this type of glycemic control is coming with less effort and burden as users realize the relief that comes from spending more time in in automation with our SmartGuard technology. It's worth pointing out that in a recent third-party survey of nearly 2,000 U.S."", 'diabetes pump users, the 780G scored No. 1 in overall pump satisfaction. And among type 1 CGM users, our Guardian 4 sensor mirrored competitor sensors in overall satisfaction. And during the quarter, we secured CE Mark for our Simplera Sync sensor for use with the 780G, and we look to begin the limited release this spring.', ""And in the U.S., we're planning to submit the 780G with Simplera Sync to the FDA in the first half of this calendar year. Simplera Sync is half the size of our current sensor. It has a disposable design and is much easier to put on. Now we've been driving the diabetes turnaround for some time, and I got to tell you, it certainly feels really good to return to double-digit growth, but we're not finished here."", 'There is definitely more work to be done as we work to bring to market an even more robust ecosystem of differentiated technology for people living with diabetes, including next-generation durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors, and algorithms. And as the intensive insulin management space moves to using smart dosing through either AID or Smart MDI, we expect an acceleration in the growth contribution from our diabetes business. Now turning to cardiac ablation solutions. We delivered 11% growth in international markets, including 9% growth in Western Europe.', ""Our strong international growth, as well as our overall performance, continues to be driven by our leading Arctic Front cryo solution, as pulse-field ablation is still in the early stages. We're seeing, though, a lot of enthusiasm in the market for our PFA products. In Europe, we're the only company with PFA offerings for both the single shot and the focal segments, And in single shot, we have now started the limited market release of our PulseSelect PFA system here in fiscal Q4, and we're seeing very efficient procedures in after just a couple of cases. And so the learning curve is really short."", 'The catheter handling and maneuverability has been excellent due to its small shaft and our custom 10 French bidirectional sheath. Clinicians are also reporting no noticeable muscle contraction with our PFA product, which is beneficial for patient experience. In focal, we continued to ramp manufacturing of the Affera mapping system and Sphere-9 catheter and remain in limited market release in Europe. Sphere-9 is the only catheter that can perform both pulse field ablation and radiofrequency ablation and high-density mapping.', ""It's really an all-in-one catheter. In the U.S., our CAS business declined in the quarter. We faced the first full quarter of competition in the cryoablation space, which is a space we created and had been the only player. In addition, many customers actually held back purchases as they awaited the launch of our PulseSelect PFA catheter, which is now commercially available."", ""We do expect to improve from here as we roll out the recently approved next-generation Nitron CryoConsole and PulseSelect, the only PFA catheter FDA-approved for both paroxysmal and persistent AF. And in addition to the European feedback, clinicians have consistently commented on how well it's visualized and how easily it connects to their mapping system. So we're also making progress in bringing our Aferra mapping system and Sphere-9 catheter to the U.S., with the last patient follow-up in our SPHERE Per-AF pivotal trial now completed. We expect to see the results at a medical meeting in the first half of this calendar year."", 'With an $8 billion market size, expanding our share in this under-penetrated cardiac ablation space is a big opportunity for us. We expect our growth profile to improve over time, first moving toward market growth and then winning share, as we bring our rich pipeline of innovation to patients who need this technology. In neurovascular this quarter, we grew high single digits when you exclude sales in China, where the market is subject to volume-based procurement. We continue to have strong double-digit growth in flow diversion globally.', 'This is being driven by our innovative Shield Technology for treating brain aneurysms, which is available on both Pipeline Flex and Vantage flow diverters. In robotics surgical technologies, we continued growing the install base for our differentiated Hugo robotic system in international markets. In the U.S., our EXPAND URO pivotal trial continues to enroll, and we expect to have first enrollment in our hernia trial very soon. We expect Hugo equipped with advanced digital capabilities to be a meaningful growth driver for us in the years ahead.', ""We believe surgeon preference for our open console and modular design, our leading position in minimally invasive surgery and instrumentation, our connected digital ecosystem and data-enabled insights, along with our world-class surgical training program and partnerships, will meaningfully advance the low penetration of robotic surgery around the world. Now turning to structural heart, we grew high single digits in the quarter, including mid-single digits sequentially, as we see ongoing adoption of Evolut FX and its improved design and market-leading valve performance. In Europe, where FX was launched for the first full quarter, we grew double digits, and Japan grew in the low 20s on the continued adoption of FX. I'm pleased to share the news today that we have submitted Evolut FX Plus to the FDA for approval."", ""FX Plus has three windows in the frame to allow easy coronary access while providing the same dependable valve performance of our Evolut platform. And we were also pleased to hear that one-year trial results of our SMART trial will be presented as a late-breaker at ACC on April 7. We're excited to see the results and are looking forward to having both FX Plus and the SMART trial, as well as the continued strength of our four-year low-risk data, as catalysts for our structural heart business. Now with that, let's go to Karen for a deeper look at our Q3 financial performance and our fiscal '24 guidance raise."", 'Karen?', 'Karen Parkhill -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""So looking at our financials, our third quarter was another quarter where we delivered on our commitments. Our revenue grew 4.6% ahead of expectations, and adjusted EPS was $1.30, $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range. We attribute the beat to stronger-than-expected revenue growth and gross margin, offset by $0.04 from greater-than-anticipated currency impact, primarily from the devaluation in the Argentine peso in December. We're delivering durable mid-single-digit revenue growth and have now for several quarters."", 'As Geoff mentioned, international markets were an important driver for us. Our non-U.S. developed markets grew 6%, including 8% growth in Western Europe and 7% growth in Japan. In fact, we had double-digit growth in several of our businesses across both of those regions.', 'Emerging markets grew 10%. We had high teens growth in the Middle East and Africa and mid-teens growth in South Asia. China grew low double digits as some of the VBP we expected there continues to be delayed, and Eastern Europe grew in the low single digits, given Russian sanctions. In the U.S., we grew 2%.', 'We have several new product approvals that are at the earliest stages of their launches and expect those launches to positively impact our U.S. growth over the next couple of quarters and beyond. Looking down the P&L, we delivered a strong quarter. Both our adjusted gross and operating margins were ahead of expectations.', 'Our adjusted gross margin of 66.1% improved year over year, overcoming a 60-basis-point headwind from foreign exchange and continued elevated inflation. We attribute the favorability primarily to the delayed China VBP and lower freight costs. We also continue to see traction from our pricing efforts and an early benefit from our comprehensive COGS efficiency efforts. While our adjusted operating margin of 25.2% declined 70 basis points, it was entirely driven by currency.', ""In fact, operating margin on a constant-currency basis was up 160 basis points from improvement in gross margin and strong SG&A leverage as we continue to drive efficiencies across the enterprise. Below the operating margin line, our adjusted tax rate was a little higher than anticipated, mainly due to the jurisdictional mix of profits. On the flip side, income on our investments was also a little better than expected with higher rates. It's worth noting that while our adjusted EPS was flat year over year, it grew 8.5% on a constant-currency basis from the leverage we drove down the P&L."", ""We also significantly improved our free cash flow and conversion in the quarter. Now turning to guidance. Given our top and bottom-line beat and continued strength in our underlying fundamentals, we're raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect full-year organic revenue growth of 4.75% to 5%."", ""For the fourth quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. On a comp-adjusted basis, this is an acceleration from the third quarter as we continue to ramp our recent product launches. With the exit of ventilators that we announced today, we are moving the associated revenue to the other segment starting in the fourth quarter. As is the case with all revenue in other, we will exclude it from our organic revenue growth, and additional details can be found in our third quarter earnings presentation."", ""Regarding currency, based on recent rates, we would see a full-year revenue impact in the range of an unfavorable $15 million to a favorable $35 million, including an unfavorable impact of $70 million to $120 million in the fourth quarter. On the bottom line, with the beat in the third quarter, we're raising our full-year EPS guidance by $0.04 at the midpoint to a new range of $5.19 to $5.21. I'd point out that given our durable performance, we've been able to increase this guidance by $0.15 at the midpoint from where we initially started the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted EPS of $1.44 to $1.46."", ""And regarding currency, based on recent rates, we're seeing an unfavorable impact of 7% on full-year EPS, including an unfavorable 5% impact in the fourth quarter. Lastly, while we'll give our fiscal-year '25 guidance on our earnings call in May after we finish our planning, I want to share our early thoughts. You've seen us deliver durable revenue growth for several quarters, and we expect that to continue. Down the P&L, inflation, currency, and tax are currently headwinds to earnings growth, and we expect to continue to increase our investments in R&D."", ""That said, we're very focused on driving offsets where we can and improving the earnings power of the company. And regarding the portfolio management decisions we announced today, while The Street's FY '25 numbers didn't yet reflect the potential separation, with today's decision, we're able to increase investment in innovation-driven growth without near-term earnings dilution or an ongoing impact to cash flow, all with a focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value. I want to close by expressing my sincere gratitude to all of our employees for your hard work and unwavering commitment to Medtronic's mission. Your dedication was instrumental in achieving our results this quarter and making a difference for so many people around the world."", 'Thank you. Geoff, turning it back to you to take it home.', 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'OK. Thank you. But before I wrap up, I want to note that Tom Holleran passed away last week at the age of 94. Tom provided decades of leadership to our company, first as general counsel, next as president, and as a director on our board for many, many years.', ""In the early '60s, Tom was one of the instrumental people who created our Medtronic mission, together with our founder, Earl Bakken. Tom was also a significant leader in the Twin Cities and beyond and served on several company boards. Our thoughts are with Tom's family as they celebrate his life. Now before we go to analyst questions, I'll close with a few brief concluding comments on our progress."", ""You've seen now for several quarters in a row that we're delivering on our commitments with durable mid-single-digit revenue growth. And when you look over the last couple of quarters, we've had a rapid cadence of meaningful innovative product approvals, many of which are just getting started, including EV-ICD, both PulseSelect and Affera in PFA, Inceptiv for SCS, Percept RC for DBS, and of course, our new Simplera Sync sensor in diabetes. And we can't forget Symplicity for hypertension. When you combine these with our investments to enter surgical robotics, along with the strong execution we're having in businesses like spine and diabetes, this is what gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering durable growth."", ""At the same time, we've been sharing with you our efforts to restore the earnings power of the company, and we're seeing those efforts begin to show up in our financials. And the comprehensive transformation that we've been working on streamlining our operating model, aligning incentives, revamping our capital and portfolio management activities, and instilling a performance-driven culture, well, this is also having an impact. These changes take time, and we're certainly not done, but it's very encouraging to see our progress and where we stand today. And equal exciting are the catalysts that we see coming, which we believe will lead to significant advancements for patients and value creation for both healthcare systems around the world and our shareholders."", ""So with that, let's move to Q&A, where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible. [Operator instructions] If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?"", 'Brad Welnick -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""[Operator instructions] Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Karen, and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and president of diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and president of the medical surgical portfolio; Sean Salmon, EVP and president of the cardiovascular portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and president of the neuroscience portfolio. [Operator instructions]"", 'Ryan Weispfenning', ""We'll take the first question from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead."", 'Larry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on another nice quarter here. I wanted to just focus my one question on the fiscal 2025 comments. Geoff and Karen, you talked about durable growth.', ""Is that -- should we think about that as mid-single-digit organic growth? And just help us -- I think there'll be some concerns about what we're seeing in the AFib business, given the low double-digit decline in the U.S. What are the puts and takes to consider there? And on earnings, Karen, can you quantify those headwinds, inflation, tax, and FX in fiscal '25? And consensus is at about 5%. Are you comfortable with consensus EPS growth? Thank you for taking the question."", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, first of all, thanks for the questions, Larry. Maybe I'll start with the CAS one. And then Karen, maybe Sean, and I will take the AFib one, and then Karen can talk about the FY '25 questions. So I'm going to phone a friend and have Sean here in a second here."", ""But on our Afib business, look, we are confident in the investments that we made that are going to bear fruit here. We haven't seen it translate into financials yet, but there's lots of leading indicators here that we're seeing that give us confidence both one in continued, I think, stronger performance than people might think in cryo, but importantly, in PFA for both PulseSelect or organic program and then Affera. But Sean, do you want to comment on this a little more specifically for Larry?"", 'Sean Salmon -- Executive Vice President and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio', 'Yeah, sure, Geoff. So, Larry, in the U.S., what we had experienced was the first time ever a competitor in the cryo segment. So we had 100% market share, and we had a competitor ramp up their production. We felt that in the fourth quarter.', ""I think there's also some interest patient for new products we're launching, including a nitron console, a refresh on our capital equipment for cryo, and of course, the PulseSelect which just started its launch in the United States after the quarter closed. And that's doing very, very well. The feedback has been exceptional. Doing well in the United States, doing well outside the United States."", ""And I think those catalysts to growth of pulse field for both the PulseSelect, that's the single-shot technology, as well as our point-by-point ablation, is driving a lot of enthusiasm. So I think we're going to see a return to growth. And into next year, we'll really feel the full force of those launches. So it's a step back, certainly in the United States, with the 11% growth worldwide or outside the United States, I should say, is giving us a lot of confidence."", ""This is a pipeline that's poised to return us to growth in that segment."", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Sean.', 'Karen Parkhill -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""And on FY '25, Larry, I would just start with the fact that we're really pleased with our performance through these last several quarters. Q3 was another solid quarter. Our fifth consecutive quarter of solid mid-single digits. And I would point out that we drove that mid-single-digit growth this quarter, off of mid-single-digit comps last year."", ""And that's what we expect to continue into FY '25. We've been working through our planning process, and we expect to wrap that up in advance of our Q4 earnings call. So we'll give our guidance in May. Not ready to give you real specifics but from a high level, we've had no major changes to the puts and takes for next year that we discussed on our earnings call in Q2."", ""And we're focused on obviously setting up guidance that sets us up for success, prioritizes innovation, and allows us to deliver on our commitments. But just on margins and down the P&L. There are puts and takes. We've got inflation that's stabilizing a bit, but it's still higher than historical."", ""Currency is always dynamic. But at recent rates, we are facing a decent headwind from FX, and we'll just have to see how that shakes out. Global tax reform is likely to be a headwind but as always, we're focused on driving offsets where we can. And as you know, we've made good and real progress on our COGS cost out work, and that started with centralizing our global ops and supply chain and focusing those teams on putting in place tangible programs that we now have in place to drive that cost at work."", ""And always, we're continuing to focus on driving pricing as an important lever. We've built a new muscle around pricing, and we're just making it stronger and stronger. And then we're always focused on controlling expenses. We've got discipline on our largest driver of our expense is our headcount, and we expect that to continue."", 'So really, no major changes from what we laid out last quarter.', 'Ryan Weispfenning', 'OK. Thanks, Larry. [Operator instructions]. Brad, can we take the next question, please?', 'Brad Welnick -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'The next question comes from Robbie Marcus at J.P. Morgan. Robbie, please go ahead.', 'Robbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask on the Patient Monitoring business. The original intent was to try and sell it or spin it.', ""You're now keeping it and exiting the ventilator business. Just maybe walk us through the thought process what happened in the market and why this is the best outcome for Medtronic. Thanks."", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I'll take that one, Robbie. So a couple of things. I'll start with -- a couple of things have changed."", ""And I'll start with what we do have strong conviction in driving profitable category leadership in this, what we're calling acute care and monitoring business. And a couple of dynamics have changed. And just as a reminder, the monitoring component -- the Patient Monitoring component is the biggest part of that -- of those businesses that we intended to spin. I think the biggest thing that change is our improved competitive positioning is in our monitoring business, in particular, changed over the last year."", 'As we are working on the process, we continue to run the business, and it performed well. And the competitive dynamics versus our main competitor, Masimo, changed significantly for the positive for us. And we believe that we can ensure that that change is durable with the increased investment. And we found a way to make that increased investment, which leads to a decision to wind down the vents business.', ""It's a very difficult decision, but the business became increasingly unprofitable throughout the last year. The growth slowed even more. And the dynamics within the vent segment are changing, moving to lower acuity ventilators. And our kind of, I'd say, unique and worthy contributions are more in the higher acuity hospital based."", ""And so with that market changing and becoming increasingly unprofitable, our decision to wind that down creates the oxygen, the investment, if you will, that we can fund the monitoring side of the equation here and ensure that this -- our competitive positioning versus Masimo, we feel like we can extend it. And another dynamic that has emerged is the use of data and the importance of data in the space, and that's been changing and becoming increasing and actually, I'd say it's the basis for innovation. And our confidence in taking that data and translating that into meaningful iteration, rapid iterations, as well as disruption, over time is pretty high, given what we've been able to do with AI and other parts of the company. And so you add all this together, and I try the last thing I'll make a comment on is, as a company more broadly, we continue to prioritize profitable growth and category leadership."", ""And when you take all these factors together, we believe we're able to provide increased investment for this acute care and monitoring business, or what we call ACM now, using the savings from vents and also bringing the two -- these were two separate businesses, Respiratory Interventions business with ventilators in it and our monitoring business, bringing them together at the leadership level also creates some savings. And then we can fund the incremental investment needed for the monitoring business, all without dilution to our P&L. So the last thing I want to say is this is a difficult decision. And it doesn't take anything away from our employees who play such a pivotal role during COVID in driving ventilator innovation and responding to the global needs during the COVID pandemic."", ""And I also want to give a nod to the -- just the legacy of the -- brand, which has been so strong. And we're proud of the rich legacy of this business and -- ventilators and this decision has not been easy. And the last thing I'll say is, this does not mean that we're going to shy away from additional portfolio moves. So don't read anything into that."", ""But the bar is high for any strategic activity that's going to dilute our focus or our earnings."", 'Ryan Weispfenning', ""OK. Thank you, Robbie. We'll take the next question. Please, Brad."", 'Brad Welnick -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne, please go ahead.', 'Joanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. There are a lot of products that I could ask about. So I'm just going to throw a couple of headline ones out there. Diabetes, congratulations on a return to U.S."", 'growth. Is there a way to peel that apart a little bit on the new accounts or new patients versus renewals? Thanks. And I guess my second question has to do with Hugo and if you can give us a little bit of a state of an update on how those launches are going outside the United States?', 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, thanks, Joanne, for the questions. Obviously, we're -- we've been working on this diabetes turnaround for some time, and it hasn't been a straight line. But we definitely have some momentum here on 780G, that platform, and just our capabilities here to use, like I was talking about in the Patient Monitoring business here as well, to create algorithms that really are differentiated and drive differentiated outcomes for patients. And that's playing out globally and now in the United States."", 'So I\'ll have Que -- maybe Que, if you could come in and answer Joanne\'s -- if you could ""peel"" a little part a little bit more for Joanne. I\'d appreciate it.', 'Que Dallara -- Executive Vice President and President of the Diabetes Portfolio', ""Yes. Look, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made every quarter since we had launched, and we are seeing new patients grow significantly, as well as renewals. So both are progressing very well. Look, it will take time to rebuild our installed base, but you can see with the pump growth that we saw in the U.S., high 40s year over year."", ""That's going to be followed by consumables and CGM growth as well. So we expect to continue to make progress every quarter, but pretty pleased with how the markets reacted to the product introduction."", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'OK. Thanks, Que. Mike Marinaro, can you jump on Hugo here?', 'Mike Marinaro -- Executive Vice President and President of the Surgical and Endoscopy Portfolio', ""Yeah. And thanks, Joanne, for the question. We continue to see very good progress with Hugo outside the United States with an expansion of installations in countries around the globe. In fact, we entered into two new subregions in Central and Eastern Europe and are continuing to see very good response to the things we've talked about previously."", 'So the open console, the very crisp visualization, and increasingly very good feedback around our Touch Surgery Enterprise platform, which on its own continues to expand and had a very good quarter with installations, both with Hugo and in our broader surgical business. Also, as Geoff noted during the commentary, we continued very good progress with our expand Euro IDE here in the U.S. and are preparing for our first patient enrollment hernia IDE. So in total, good reception, a sharpening sort of appreciation for the features of Hugo, I think an emergence of the digital ecosystem and an appreciation for that as well.', 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. I'd say, Joanne, on this one -- thanks, Mike, first of all. And I'd say on this one, the robotic system has been and the features are -- and had been well received, but it's broader than that, as Mike pointed out. I mean, it's about the digital platform that comes with it and -- as well as the instrumentation as we transition instrumentation in our laparoscopic business onto the robot, particularly stapling and energy."", ""All these moves build momentum -- build capabilities and momentum over time. And we're seeing -- we saw that play out in the spine business. We bought Mazor, it wasn't an overnight change. You saw our last couple of quarters have been, but it took the integration of these things."", ""Mazor with our navigation and then imaging and then getting these AI guided surgical planning systems, all these things coming together, every quarter, more progress have built the ecosystem we have today that's really driving, not just the growth for Medtronic, but the growth for the spine industry right now. And we expect to do the same thing in soft tissue surgery."", 'Ryan Weispfenning', ""OK. Thank you, Joanne. We'll take the next question, please, Brad."", 'Brad Welnick -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'The next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead.', 'Travis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hey, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me OK?', 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Hey, Travis. How are you doing?', 'Travis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Good, good. Hey, Geoff, just curious if you could talk a little bit more on the gross margin productivity. Some of the things you're driving there. And can you still get the kind of two to three times annual cost savings on the gross margin line? And last month, the investor comments, you talked a lot about leverage -- growth."", ""I'm just curious if that's a comment that applies to FY '25 or if that was more of a longer-term comment."", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Let me tell you, I'll start off and transition to Karen. On the gross margin, a couple of things that I'd point out. One is pricing."", ""Karen talked about that. I do think -- what we're seeing here is a lot of innovation in the industry and a lot at Medtronic. And this innovation we're finding is valued. It drives value in the health system."", ""And I think we've gotten better at showing the health economics of the innovation that applies from the innovation in addition to the clinical value. I think in the past, we were pretty indexed on clinical value. And more recently, we keep that focus and then add the health economics, and it's getting paid for. And we're -- I think doing a better job of making those points and getting that pricing."", ""And I do think it's durable. So the pricing has increased, I'd say, for the company overall 200 basis points or so relative to the past. And I think we're going to keep pushing for even more. On."", ""The converse, if you don't have the innovation, be prepared for that as well because I think hospitals have gotten more sophisticated in the purchasing and your price is going to pay for that if you're not keeping up with the innovation. But we -- given where we are on the product-like goals and given this pricing loss, so we feel good about that being especially to the historical baseline. The other you asked about is cost of goods sold productivity. And the answer -- the short answer to your question is yes, we do think it's sustainable."", ""We've got lots of opportunity here. Can you think about it, we have this pretty big footprint of factories and distribution centers and too many suppliers, I said in the past. Now with Greg Smith coming in a couple of years ago and we've centralized that, we can take a strategic look across that portfolio and we have a long list of cost-down programs. And then we've ensured that we've effectively contracted those between our global operations and supply chain team and our operating units."", ""Because it takes release product engineering to make sure that these cost programs can happen that are in our operating units. So we feel good about that, and we feel that that's sustainable. So those are two big changes that impact positively gross margins now and into the future. And speaking of the future, I'll turn it over to Karen to talk about your FY '25 leverage question."", 'Karen Parkhill -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So just on -- I'll just add on gross margins, too. We're pleased with our performance that we had this quarter. We overcame a 60-basis-point headwind from FX and continued inflationary pressures."", ""And a lot of that was driven by strong pricing, which Geoff talked about. We did have some continued delays in China VBPs, in aortic in peripheral vascular, in stapling. And those VBPs could be coming through this coming fourth quarter, this current fourth quarter, and potentially into next year. So that's just something going on in gross margins."", ""As we talk -- as we think about leverage down the P&L, clearly, we're focused on driving leverage. And I think we talked about it last quarter, Travis, clear leverage is where your bottom line grows faster than your top line. We're focused on getting there eventually. We're not ready to talk about that for FY '25."", ""It's still too early for our planning guidance. And I've already pointed out lots of different puts and takes for next year."", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah.

Our people are the No.', ""1 driver of our cost there. And so we've put a discipline in there that we're holding to. And then finally, just setting up the portfolio for profitable growth. And the decision on -- with the changing dynamics, the decision to hold our monitoring business because of the confidence in the profitable growth is evidence of that is setting up the portfolio the right way."", ""So I'll leave it there on the focus of -- on recovering the earnings power of the company and we'll provide more details on that FY '25 look next quarter."", 'Ryan Weispfenning', 'OK. Thank you, Travis. Next question, Brad?', 'Brad Welnick -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'The next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead.', 'Vijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess one on earnings questions here. I look at your peers, their earnings have grown versus fiscal '19 -- 2019 pre-pandemic levels."", 'Medtronic earnings have essentially been flattish. Can Medtronic commit to perhaps about trend earnings growth over the medium term as you play catch up similar to what your peers have done? And I think related to that, Geoff, in the past, you mentioned about a $400 million drag from investments in Ardian, Hugo. Where are we on those investments? Are they still a drag? When can those be profitable to the business?', 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Vijay, for the questions. I'll start with the latter question on Ardian and Hugo and let Karen handle the earnings growth ones and further comment on the Ardian and Hugo. I'd say on -- look, Hugo -- the way we're looking at Hugo is a part of our broader surgical franchise, an important part of that and it needs investment. And it is -- if you look at Hugo specifically, it is taking a meaningful amount of investment to keep it going here."", ""We've reached -- I love the milestone that we're at now in terms of a robot that's out there that's performing well and has got great features that are valued by physicians globally. The feedback has been strong, but we still got more work to do. We've got to get our instruments on there. We've got to complete the U.S."", ""trial. We've got to continue to build out a U.S. -- a capital equipment U.S. sales force."", ""So this is a tall order. But our confidence in executing there is high, and it's important to this huge business, our surgical business, which is our biggest business and drives a lot of profit and cash flow. And I say our confidence is high. I know we're up against a strong competitor in Intuitive."", ""But we like our competitive positioning overall and especially against the other potential robotic companies there and dynamics of this market, we think, play in our favor. So there's investment there. On Ardian, and by the way, we're really trying to call it Symplicity now. We've got to get -- we'll get ready for some consumer education on this hypertension therapy."", ""So we're trying to get rid of the Ardian term as much as possible. So we've got a square jargon going on around here on that one. But on hypertension, this one, we believe, will start to show some profits here. So it's much less of a drag, and we hope to, in the next couple of quarters and in the medium term, this to generate not just revenue but income."", ""It's a highly profitable product line for us with high gross margins, and it will be a positive to our overall mix. And like I said, Hugo is going to take investment, but this one, I think, will provide oxygen, not in the next quarter or two, but over the medium term here. So I'll leave it there, but it's -- and turn it over to Karen."", 'Karen Parkhill -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. And I would just say on earnings, we've made good progress on driving the earnings power of the company just in this year. I noted that we've been able to increase our guidance on the bottom line by $0.15 at the midpoint from where we initially started the year, and that's driven by the strong track record that we've drove -- that we've driven in the last -- the first three quarters of this year. And we do expect that to continue."", ""Over the medium and long term, we are committed to the right earnings growth. There's no debate about that. And we're focused on overcoming the headwinds that we've got over that time frame and delivering on that growth."", 'Ryan Weispfenning', 'Thanks, Vijay. We probably have time for two more questions. Brad, take two more.', 'Brad Welnick -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'OK. The next question goes to Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead.', 'Matt Miksic -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. Can you hear me OK?', 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yes, we can now.', 'Matt Miksic -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Great. Thank you. So maybe just a follow-up here on some of the products that you've mentioned recently approved and I think some of the products that you hope to see approved in the coming quarters, and I'm thinking of like Aurora and PulseSelect and in additions to the U.S. approved products in diabetes."", ""And I know Sean mentioned sort of the rough trajectory for AF ablation. But maybe on that business, for example, any additional color around cadence? Is this something that we start to see improve in the fourth quarter? Or is this sort of like an early to mid-'25 kind of process on some of the same commentary for sort of cadence and trajectory in Aurora and for example, maybe the diabetes business would be super helpful? Thanks."", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. So maybe I'll start with Sean. Before I turn it over to Sean, as I pointed out in the commentary, all the puts and takes in the -- our ablation business, what we call cardiac ablation solutions, our Afib business. We do see an acceleration in this business even in the fourth quarter here."", ""So -- but I'll turn it over to Sean to talk about Afib and then Aurora."", 'Sean Salmon -- Executive Vice President and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio', ""Yeah. Thanks, Geoff. And Matt, the trajectory is obviously going to be upward for both the EV-ICD, as well as the CAS business in total. As you launch these new technologies, there's some training that you have to do to make sure that the physicians are comfortable with how to use the products."", ""And that's, of course, something we're very deliberate about to make sure that there's a good patient outcome and good acceptance of the technology. And that's something we do pretty frequently in our business. So we're really, really good at it. And the feedback has been excellent."", ""The procedure efficiency on PulseSelect has been looking these cases done in like half an hour. And the acceptance on Aurora has been exceptional, too. So as I said, I think it's the same story for both those technologies where you push growth now, but into next year, we'll see the full impact of these innovations."", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Que, you want to comment on diabetes?', 'Que Dallara -- Executive Vice President and President of the Diabetes Portfolio', ""Yeah. Look, we continue to push the pipeline in diabetes, starting with Simpler approved with CE Mark last September, followed by Simplera Sync recently approved that we announced at JPMorgan, and we completed our clinical trials for -- with Simplera Sync in the U.S., which we expect to submit in this first half of the calendar year. So that's the cadence that you should expect. And as Geoff mentioned in his opening comments, we have next-generation products that we discussed at ADA last year that we continue to make progress on and aggressively moving to get next-generation TID pumps in patch comes out to the market."", 'Matt Miksic -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Thanks.', 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you. Thanks, Sean.', 'Ryan Weispfenning', ""Thanks, Matt. I apologize to the analysts that we weren't able to get to. We have time, though, for one more, Brad."", 'Brad Welnick -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'The final question comes from Anthony Petrone at Mizuho Securities. Anthony, please go ahead.', 'Anthony Petrone -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'Thanks. Can you hear me OK?', 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yes, we can. Yes, we can.', 'Anthony Petrone -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'OK, great. One, condolences on passing of Tom to the team and his family. And maybe one just going to structural heart. Maybe just to set up on the SMART study, quick two-part question.', ""One, was that ahead of schedule? Was it expected to be at TCT instead of ACC? So as the late breaker getting approved a surprise? And then maybe just high level, how do you think that study will play out once we have the results? It is head-to-head in TAVR in high-risk symptomatic severe. So just thoughts on how you think that data received once it's out there post-ACC at that session in the coming weeks? Thanks."", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, thanks -- first of all, Anthony, thanks for the comment on Tom Holloran. He's a real legend around here and just a great guy, so we're going to miss him. On structural heart, two comments before I turn it over to Sean. First, I really applaud the business for their evidence generation in total."", ""On -- we just did our low-risk data and we publish it every year, not just when it's convenient. And then they had the courage to do a head-to-head, which is not something that's often done in our space. And so I can tell you that I, for one, love that, just the commitment to data and the competitiveness to go head-to-head. And I'm very much looking forward to the results that are going to come out in early April at ACC."", ""But in terms of the specifics of what you're asking on how it might play out, I'll turn that over to Sean."", 'Sean Salmon -- Executive Vice President and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio', ""Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. The completement of enrollment happened in October of '22. So that's a 12-month endpoint for the study, and that pushes you really out of the window for TCT."", ""So I think we're on schedule, I'd say. Pleased to have been accepted as a late-breaker at ACC. But that's really, as expected, I'd say. In terms of the trial itself and how it'll be received, I think the momentum that we have on data from the notion 10-year data that's low-risk patients out 10 years showing superior durability of our valve compared to surgical implants and then our four-year low-risk study with hard endpoint benefits and a widening benefit on serious outcomes like mortality and disabling stroke then, of course, going head-to-head in a really important patient population, those with a small -- we said that's about 40% of the global market, really prevalent among women and within smaller patient populations like in Japan, for example."", ""So that's -- I think it's really important and compelling data. It's a one-year outcome, which portends long-term outcomes. And I think that we're excited for the reception of these results. And we do think that that's a catalyst for growth for us with our really unique position in that particular subset of patients, which is a big chunk of the market at 40%."", 'Geoff Martha -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""OK. Thanks, Sean. And so just to wrap it up here, one final comment on the ventilation -- the monitoring and ventilation decisions. As a result of these portfolio decisions, Bob White will be leaving Medtronic, and he's been just such an impactful and important leader for the company for a long time."", ""And although the friendship will remain strong, we're definitely going to miss working with him day to day, and I want to wish him well. And I know that comes from the board of directors and the executive committee and everybody at Medtronic who's interacted with Bob, just a high ethical leader and just a good guy and we wish him well. And in terms of -- and so for terms of today, I just want to thank everybody for the questions. Definitely appreciate your support and continued interest in Medtronic, and we hope you'll join us again for our Q4 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Thursday, May 23."", ""And again, we'll update you on our progress and how we finish the fiscal year but also look ahead to fiscal '25.

The defense contractor also pays a generous yield of 2.97%, and it has ample free cash flow to fund its top-shelf dividend program.

As we recently saw with the market falloff – a result of hotter-than-anticipated inflation numbers – putting your eggs in similar baskets could lead to unmitigated red ink in your holdings. Instead, going the oddball direction can be weird enough to protect you from too much exposure to one particular sector.', 'Finally, certain investments that seem peculiar now could be labeled astute down the line.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This waste management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13.3%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $3.72 billion, up 5.5% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.63% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% and reach $110 billion by 2033.

Moreover, the rise in government initiatives toward recycling waste is also contributing to the expansion of the market.', 'One of the major trends in the market is the adoption of smart recycling technologies. These technologies include sensitive systems and robotic waste separation. The rise in the demand for recycled materials will create new opportunities for companies across industries including construction, automotive, and packaging.

These treatment technologies are expected to revolutionize the waste recycling landscape by generating energy from both non-recyclable and organic waste streams.', 'The United States is expected to grow significantly over the forecasted period.

The US EPA is targeting a rate of 50% recycling by 2030 in its National Recycling Strategy. The current recycling rate is nearly 32% in the country. However, the rate of recycling plastic is only around 5% in the US. 25 communities, selected by the EPA, will receive more than $70 million in grants to enhance their recycling facilities. The agency will offer an additional $32 million to states and territories to deploy their waste management plans. The grants approved for communities range from $500,000 to $4 million. These funds will support multiple projects, ranging from upgrading equipment to funding composting programs.', 'The rise in advanced recycling technologies and increasing adoption of circular economy principles are some other factors that are driving the growth of the recycling market.

If you want to read about some more stocks in the Asness portfolio, go directly to 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness.', ""Cliff Asness, the head of AQR Capital Management, stands out as one of Wall Street's most accomplished hedge fund managers. AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, traces its origins to Goldman Sachs' asset management division, a leading global investment bank. With an initial investment of $10 million from a select group of investors in 1995, Asness utilized quantitative methods to swiftly expand the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund to over $100 million within a matter of months. Despite Asness departing from Goldman Sachs to establish his hedge fund in 1998, the Alpha Fund continued its growth trajectory, managing assets worth $12 billion by 2007."", 'Cliff Asness often appears on television and podcasts, where he shares his expertise on financial matters. In a Bloomberg podcast last year,\xa0he expressed apprehension about overinflated stock prices, cautioned about challenges in the commercial real estate sector, and even forecasted the possibility of a looming financial crisis.', '“My biggest concern is stocks and bonds seem to be taking a very, very different view. Bonds are pricing in multiple, severe cuts over the next year to two years. That is a forecast for a recession, and not a mild one. Equities are whistling past the graveyard. If inflation stays sticky, or it comes down because we enter a non-trivial recession, it’s equities that I think are a scary place. They’re not priced very consistently with bonds, and we’re going to find out who’s right in the next year.”', ""Asness recently grabbed attention by reiterating his stance on emerging-market equities outperforming the US market, despite this trade's lackluster performance in recent years. AQR allocates approximately $8 billion of its $99 billion under management to an emerging-market equities portfolio, managed collaboratively like its other funds. This perspective challenging the dominance of US stocks aligns AQR with other major players in the industry, such as Morgan Stanley Investment Management."", 'In addition, the billionaire\'s hedge fund closed out 2023 with impressive double-digit returns across several of its funds, driven by strong performance in stock selection, bonds, European natural gas, and iron ore, as reported by Reuters. The investment manager achieved a net return of 18.5% for the year in its AQR Absolute Return strategy, its longest-running multi-strategy fund. This marked a notable comparison to the almost 44% net return achieved in 2022. Asness had predicted in January 2023 that this particular investing approach, involving ""going long cheap companies and shorting expensive ones"" within specific sectors, would be particularly appealing for the year. With that in mind, lets look at some of the top stocks in the AQR Capital Management portfolio, which include the likes of Apple Inc.

This upgrade followed the company's decision to discontinue merger discussions with The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), a move perceived to have multiple downsides according to the analyst."", 'By the end of last year’s fourth quarter, 86 out of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey’s research had bought a stake in Humana Inc.

The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth. For value-conscious investors like us, investing in healthcare requires looking beyond the obvious to identify businesses that have exposure to this growth industry but which trade at low prices.

The company sold 7,615 homes, which was below expectations, at an average price of $547,000, down from $561,000 a year ago. The decline in home sales was attributed to the surge in the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to nearly 8%, the highest level in two decades. These high rates led many potential homebuyers to postpone their purchases and prompted sellers to offer concessions. However, as mortgage rates moderated in the latter half of the quarter, PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) experienced a 57% increase in net new orders to 6,214 homes valued at approximately $3.4 billion.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.', ""A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years."", 'The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Cigna basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares.

Just give us your assessment just of where Paramount specifically stands, and when we talk about consolidation, whether or not it's inevitable that some of these smaller players need to some sort of combine or bundle up with the larger players in order to better compete."", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, I'm in the minority. If you speak to most of our institutional investors, they would say that consolidation really makes no sense, and there's good reasons for the buy side to say that. I understand why they draw that conclusion because we've already seen many rounds of consolidation with Disney Fox. We saw Warner Brothers Discovery. We saw CBS-Viacom."", ""And none of them, none of those deals sort of was the elixir that allowed them to generate copious amounts of profits in streaming. So the buy side says we're sort of done with consolidation. Even if we see more consolidation, it's not going to help any of these incumbent firms. And I think it's just dead wrong. We need another round of consolidation. It will help these incumbent firms compete with the likes of Netflix."", '- How will that consolidation then, from your purview, change the pricing mechanisms that these companies put forward to consumers?', ""JASON BAZINET: You know, I don't think it's so much about pricing per se. I would say that we went through a chapter, I'll call it 2019 through 2021-ish, where it was just give away the product, trying get as many subs as you can to get scale. And we're now in a chapter where a lot of these media companies are saying, look, we can't generate losses forever in streaming. We're going to take pricing up."", 'So if we see another round of consolidation, I think pricing will go up for the video streaming apps, but it would go up anyway. What we really are focused on is more about the cost savings that you get with consolidation, and equally critical, just rationalizing the number of apps that are out in the marketplace. We just have too many video apps.', ""- Jason, talk to us just a little bit more about what that cost savings perspective, what that's going to do, how much will it really save some of these media players in the long run."", ""JASON BAZINET: Yeah. Typically, it runs a low single digit percentage of the cost structure of the pro forma firm. So it's billions of dollars, no matter which combination you envisage."", ""- And so with that in mind, I mean, we're already hearing as well that there's going to be some potential pushback from the DOJ if there's more of this consolidation effort that goes forward. Where do you think that companies will have to strike the right tone in their messaging to regulators as well?"", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, I don't know. It's pretty interesting because the regulators have a propensity to almost be too backward-looking, right? And so there certainly is some risk that you'll get regulatory pushback. I can tell you the way the institutional investors are looking at it is the real competition is really from the tech giants that are getting into the streaming business, whether that's an Apple or an Amazon."", ""And so the buy side doesn't really look at consolidation as a constraint. But sometimes, the regulators tend to be a little bit backward-looking and might say, there's too much consolidation, but I think that would be the wrong answer.""]"

At the time, the digital payment provider dazzled the bulls with its robust growth rates and its plans to nearly double its number of active accounts from 377 million in 2020 to 750 million in 2025. It also aimed to more than double its annual free cash flow (FCF) and revenue to $10 billion and $50 billion, respectively, by 2025."", ""Unfortunately, PayPal's stock price subsequently plunged more than 80% as it abandoned those ambitious goals. In 2023, its active accounts actually declined 2% to 426 million, its annual FCF shrank 18% to $4.2 billion, and its revenue rose a mere 8% to $29.8 billion. CEO Dan Schulman, who led PayPal ever since its spin-off from eBay in 2015, also stepped down as its sales growth cooled off."", 'That slowdown was caused by stiff competition, macro headwinds for consumer spending, tough comparisons to the temporary surge in digital payments during the pandemic, and its decoupling from eBay, which replaced PayPal with its Dutch rival Adyen as its preferred payments platform in a five-year transition from 2018 to 2023.', ""All of that pressure also reduced its transaction take rate over the past eight years. Let's take a closer look at that key performance metric and see why investors can't ignore its persistent decline."", ""PayPal charges a fee for every digital payment made through its platform. Its fees usually range from 1.9% to 3.5% plus a fixed fee for each transaction. After splitting those fees with credit card processors and other payment networks, we get its transaction take rate -- the total revenue it actually retains from each transaction. That metric reflects its overall pricing power in the digital payments market. But as the following chart illustrates, PayPal's annual transaction take rate has declined from 2.89% in 2015 to 1.76% in 2023 and has never expanded year over year."", ""PayPal attributed that decline to several major challenges. Its gradual loss of eBay's orders reduced its overall take rates, and that decline drove it to rely more heavily on Venmo's peer-to-peer payments and Braintree's unbranded backend payment services, both of which had lower take rates than its marketplace transactions on eBay."", ""Its branded payments business also recognized more transactions from higher-volume merchants with lower take rates, and it recognized lower international transaction revenue from its foreign currency hedges. Meanwhile, fierce competition from other platforms like Adyen, Stripe, Block's Square and Cash App, Apple Pay, and Alphabet's Google Pay made it tough to raise its fees and counter those headwinds."", ""PayPal isn't the only company struggling with declining take rates. Adyen's transaction take rate fell from 3.06% in 2015 to 1.74% in the first half of 2023. Stripe, which is privately held, only had a gross take rate of 1.75% in 2022."", ""Those shrinking take rates suggest the digital payments market is getting too crowded, and big tech companies like Apple and Google -- which can afford to operate their digital payment platforms as loss-leading extensions of their ecosystems -- can disrupt those stand-alone services. The bears argue that PayPal can't keep pace with that seismic shift."", 'PayPal has been trying to offset its gradual loss of active accounts by increasing its number of transactions per active account to boost its total revenue. That strategy worked in 2023 when its total transactions per active account grew 14%.', 'But roughly half of that growth was driven by Braintree, while the rest mainly came from Venmo and its core app. Its high dependence on Braintree and Venmo will likely continue to dilute its transaction take rates for the foreseeable future.', 'Looking ahead, PayPal needs its growth in transactions per active account to offset its declining take rates as well as its ongoing loss of active accounts. To accomplish that, it needs to add new features to PayPal\'s core app to squeeze more revenue from its existing users. PayPal\'s new CEO Alex Chriss plans to achieve that goal by adding new features like its streamlined checkout service FastLane, its Smart Receipts tool, and its Cash Pass rewards program to its core app. But during its latest conference call, Chriss said those new features would only make a ""minimal contribution"" to its top line in 2024.', 'Simply put, PayPal needs to spin a lot of plates to keep growing. But as long as it continues to lose active accounts and its take rates keep declining, it will likely stay in the penalty box and look like a value trap instead of a value stock.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Guidance for Q1 was also strong, with revenue expected to increase by 25% to $478 million."", 'These fantastic results caused the stock to spike around 20% the following trading day, and the stock now trades for 25 times sales.', 'This is far more expensive than the level at which I purchased shares and nearly the same as its revenue growth level.

It’s a development that is changing the landscape of an area known for farming, military bases and Chitose airport. It’s a project that also aims to change the face of Japan’s chip industry.', 'A freshly created homegrown venture, Rapidus Corp., is looking to mass produce state-of-the art 2 nanometer logic chips in 2027 from an initial starting point of zero. By industry standards it’s an implausible challenge for an 18-month-old venture in a country that has fallen far behind overseas rivals on semiconductor production.But with the US and China sparring over access to the latest chipmaking expertise and equipment, Japan’s government has sensed an opportunity to leverage Washington’s concern over supply chain security to get back into a game it once dominated.', 'The stakes are huge. Advanced chips will serve as the foundation for a dozen critical technologies, including artificial intelligence, weapons systems and electric vehicles. A large portion of global production centers on Taiwan and South Korea, leaving future supplies vulnerable to regional tensions.', '“There are geopolitical, economic security factors involved,” said Atsuo Shimizu, a Rapidus executive in charge of launching the new foundry. “To survive as a nation, Japan needs to be a global player with technology. And we can clearly demonstrate that with semiconductors.”', 'Why Making Computer Chips Has Become a New Arms Race: QuickTake', 'Tokyo has already shown it means business. In less than three years, Japan has earmarked about ￥4 trillion ($26.7 billion) for revitalizing its semiconductor punching power with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida targeting financial support for the industry to eventually reach ￥10 trillion with private sector support. Among the goals is a tripling of domestically produced chip sales to more than ￥15 trillion by 2030.', 'Japan’s new chip strategy has two main strands. First, the country is seeking to reestablish itself as a prime location for manufacturing legacy chips by luring to Japan the biggest foreign names in the industry with generous subsidies of up to half of the set-up costs.The second and more ambitious part of the strategy is the Rapidus project in Hokkaido aimed at restoring Japan’s place as a player at the forefront of silicon-chip wizardry.“Why do we do so much for chips? Honestly, that’s because there’s the US-China confrontation,” said Kazumi Nishikawa, principal director of economic security policy at Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and one of the architects of the strategy. “If chip supplies from Taiwan halt, there will be negative impacts of trillions of dollars everywhere and economies will collapse.”', 'Already Tokyo can claim some success in the first and larger part of its strategy. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., has a $7 billion factory edging closer to production in Kumamoto, southern Japan, with another one to come and talk of a third. The Taiwanese giant has quickly realized that chip projects partly bankrolled by Tokyo can get off the ground a whole lot faster than in the US or other countries.', 'By drawing on the expertise of the world’s leading manufacturers, Japan hopes to recreate chip-related ecosystems that provide employment and renewed growth in its regional economies.Read More: Japan’s Chip Spree Aims to Kick Economy Into High GearAt the same time these moves will help strengthen Japan’s credentials as a key ally in a US-led global supply chain committed to keeping the production line of vital semiconductors rolling for everything from smartphones and cars to the latest missile systems.The fate of the second part of Tokyo’s strategy looks far less certain. The Rapidus project has generated both excitement and doubts. Its success hinges on achieving a huge technological jump with little idea of how costly or reliable the final output will be—or if there will be any buyers. It’s a target that even industry leaders are struggling to attain.', ""On the plus side, Japan can lean on the US as its ally this time around, rather than its technological foe—as was the case back in 1986 when Washington put pressure on Tokyo to limit its chip exports.As part of the Rapidus project, IBM Corp. is training about 100 veteran Japanese engineers in Albany, New York, to get them up to speed on frontier level US chip expertise.“We're partners, allies, collaborators in making sure that our national security, our economic securities are aligned, because the threat is coming from somewhere else. And that somewhere else is China,” US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said. “We're in the boat together and we're paddling in the same direction.”"", 'Japan’s strategy marks a departure from previous attempts to support its chip industry that largely assumed it didn’t need outside help -- and ended in failure.', 'Along with TSMC, Micron Technology Inc., ASML Holding NV and Samsung Electronics Co. are also investing in production or research facilities in Japan as companies look for the best deals for shoring up their future output in an uncertain world.The speed of Japan’s assistance contrasts with the policy gridlock of the US. The 2022 Chips and Science Act set aside $39 billion in direct subsidies to ramp up manufacturing in the US, but the first major award of $1.5 billion only got announced this week. Labor and cost challenges have also delayed the start of production at TSMC’s new facility in Arizona. Over in Germany, budget turmoil has raised concerns about subsidies for TSMC and Intel Corp.“Japan this time has taken a bold approach and has implemented very quick decision-making,” Belgium-based microelectronics research hub Imec Chief Executive Officer Luc Van den hove said. “If I look back 20 years ago or 15 years ago, I think there was much more a closed policy especially from the government.”', 'The TSMC plants have ample reason to be successful. The technology for the first plant’s products, 12nm to 28nm logic chips, is already established. Kumamoto is on Japan’s southern island of Kyushu where there’s an ecosystem of about 1,000 related tech companies. And there are customers – including Japanese carmakers.', 'TSMC’s second foundry, officially announced earlier this month, will make 6nm to 7nm chips nearby. By 2037, tax revenues from the foundries are likely to have paid back the initial government outlays, according to lawmaker Yoshihiro Seki, secretary general of a coalition within Japan’s ruling party dedicated to chips.', 'Japan is an attractive location for other reasons, too. It has a highly disciplined workforce and reliable services. The plunge in the Japanese yen to its weakest levels in decades has also helped make the country far more affordable as a production base.Japan is also a key global supplier of some of the chemicals and equipment used in chipmaking. Some of those Japanese suppliers, including Tokyo Electron Ltd., have taken advantage of the flipside of the economic security concerns by tapping into a surge of Chinese demand as Beijing looks to ramp up its existing know-how before any more restrictions emerge.', 'While some of the reasons for Japan’s attractiveness as a chip-making base also hold true in northern Japan, the circumstances are quite different. Rapidus is starting out in a long-forgotten region for manufacturing with only about 20 local businesses related to chip making.Read More: Japan-Backed Startup Woos Suppliers to Make Chip Hub in HokkaidoExpertise at Japan’s national technology institute has long been stalled at 45 nm, so for Rapidus to reach significant output of 2nm chips using unproven IBM technology in around five years looks a very tall order. Even if Rapidus is able to hit its target by 2027, TSMC and Samsung will likely have already jumped into the market at volumes that will give them a cost advantage.', 'Shigeru Fujii headed chipmaking at Japan’s Fujitsu Ltd. when it lost out to cheaper Taiwanese and South Korean rivals in past decades. He’s yet to see evidence that Rapidus can break into the cut-throat global market.“The problem is: Will there be any customers?” Fujii said.', 'This time will be different, said Rapidus’s Shimizu, who worked under Fujii at Fujitsu. As its name suggests, Rapidus will add value to its products by shortening delivery time for its bespoke chips – not just via the manufacturing process, but also by helping customers shorten the time-consuming design process, he said.The company won’t be able to compete against TSMC and Samsung for commoditized devices so the company will aim for more of a premium niche market, Shimizu indicated.', 'A shift in technology could also help Rapidus, Shimizu added. The 2-nanometer chips it envisages will use a Gate-All-Around transistor structure instead of the current FinFET structure, making it easier for newcomers to break in, Shimizu said.“We can do it,” he said. “I don’t see any reason why we can’t.”', 'The government has so far promised ￥330 billion and earmarked an extra ￥646 billion in a fund to support the Rapidus project. That should cover half of an initial ￥2 trillion investment, but the private company has yet to say how it will raise the remaining cash or an extra ￥3 trillion needed to expand operations after the foundry is launched.In contrast to the government support Rapidus enjoys, the reaction from corporate Japan has been lukewarm. Big firms such as Toyota Motor Corp. have pledged only ￥7.3 billion for the venture so far.', ""What Bloomberg Intelligence Says…“The Japanese government's latest chip strategy looks better thought out than on previous occasions. The balance is a little skewed toward Rapidus and Kumamoto. Perhaps more could be done to support domestic chip design companies. The challenge for Rapidus is huge, and success probably shouldn't hinge on profits. If it can make any reliable 2 nanometer chips by 2027 that would be a success for Japan in terms of economic security.”-- Masahiro Wakasugi, BI industry analyst"", 'Even if IBM trains engineers for the company, Rapidus will struggle to hire the 1,000 or so engineers and workers needed to launch the foundry, experts say. Japan’s chip sector hemorrhaged around 30% of its jobs in the two decades through 2019 as its share of the global chipmaking market fell from over 50% to less than 10%. That leaves a shortage of at least 40,000 workers over the next decade as the population declines, according to METI.', 'Takashi Yunogami is a former Hitachi Ltd. engineer who made news by fiercely criticizing past government initiatives in parliament right before the chip strategy was released. He likens Rapidus’s 2nm goal to a little leaguer in baseball trying to turn into superstar Shohei Ohtani overnight.', '“Kids should dream, but if a baseball boy says he is trying to do well as a two-way player starting from tomorrow, I’d say, ‘Hold on.

Rapidus has also struck an agreement with Canada’s Tenstorrent Inc. to jointly develop semiconductor intellectual property in AI devices.“There are so many risks and challenges for Rapidus. It’s still in a research and development stage before becoming a business,” said METI’s Nishikawa.', 'Still, Japan’s hefty subsidies show a renewed determination at the trade and industry ministry to take advantage of a window of opportunity to claw back some of the nation’s chip power. They also reflect the view that in an increasingly hostile world it’s better to throw money at chip technology than to have no contingency plan at all.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, North Korea’s launching of missiles and China’s posturing toward Taiwan have reminded the world of the vital importance of securing chip supplies and strengthening defense systems.“Chips are used for drones, fighters, submarines and missiles,” said the LDP’s Seki. “If we can make others feel Japan can halt chip exports if they mess with us, that will mean our investment has served as a war deterrent, too.”', '--With assistance from Takashi Mochizuki, Yuki Furukawa, Peter Elstrom and Vlad Savov.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'The High Cost of Eating Out in America', 'Can the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?', 'How Capital One’s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect Consumers', 'Why Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First Place', 'Plug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV Market', '©2024 Bloomberg L.P.']"

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with TAP.', ""Brand Portfolio and Market Presence: Molson Coors Beverage Co (NYSE:TAP) boasts a powerful array of core power brands, including Coors Light, Miller Lite, and Blue Moon, which have cemented the company's market presence. These brands have not only demonstrated enduring consumer appeal but have also allowed the company to command significant shelf space and customer loyalty. The company's strategic partnerships and licensing agreements with other major players like Heineken and Coca-Cola have further expanded its reach, enabling it to leverage a broad distribution network and capitalize on established brand equity."", ""Financial Resilience and Diversification: The company's financial statements reflect a robust balance sheet with healthy cash flows, indicative of its financial resilience. Molson Coors has diversified its revenue streams by venturing into the flavored malt beverage segment and the spirits category, with acquisitions such as the 75% equity interest in Blue Run, a high-end whiskey business. This diversification strategy not only mitigates risks associated with market fluctuations in the beer segment but also positions the company to tap into the growing demand for premium and craft beverages."", ""Debt and Operating Restrictions: Despite a strong balance sheet, Molson Coors carries a notable level of debt, which could impose operating covenants and restrictions that limit strategic flexibility. The company's credit rating is subject to the performance of the business and market conditions, and any deterioration could increase borrowing costs or limit access to capital markets. This financial leverage, while manageable, necessitates prudent financial management to ensure long-term sustainability."", ""Dependence on Core Brands: The company's reliance on a small number of core brands for a significant portion of its sales volume presents a vulnerability. Should consumer preferences shift away from these flagship products, Molson Coors could face substantial revenue impacts. This dependence underscores the need for continuous innovation and marketing efforts to maintain the relevance and competitiveness of these key brands."", ""Expansion into New Segments and Markets: The evolving consumer trends toward premium and above-premium products, including hard seltzers and spirits, present significant growth opportunities for Molson Coors. The company's recent foray into these segments aligns with market dynamics, and further investment in innovation could capture additional market share. Moreover, emerging and developing markets offer untapped potential for expansion, where the company can leverage its extensive portfolio and distribution capabilities."", 'Adaptation to Changing Consumer Preferences: Molson Coors has the opportunity to lead the industry in responding to the shift in consumer purchasing behavior, particularly within the premium segment. By focusing on consumer insights and adapting its product offerings accordingly, the company can strengthen its position in the market. Strategic marketing and promotional activities can enhance brand visibility and appeal to a broader demographic, capitalizing on the growing interest in craft and specialty beverages.', ""Intense Competition and Market Consolidation: The beer industry is characterized by intense competition from both large global brewers and smaller craft producers. Molson Coors faces the challenge of differentiating its products in a crowded marketplace while contending with the aggressive marketing and pricing strategies of competitors. Market consolidation could also lead to stronger competitors and shifts in distributor networks, potentially impacting the company's market share and profitability."", ""Regulatory and Economic Risks: Molson Coors operates in a highly regulated industry, with varying distribution systems and trade regulations across different regions. Changes in tax, environmental, and trade policies could impose additional costs or disrupt operations. Economic trends, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and consumer spending patterns, also pose risks that could affect the company's financial performance."", ""In conclusion, Molson Coors Beverage Co (NYSE:TAP) exhibits a strong market presence backed by a diverse and iconic brand portfolio. The company's strategic expansion into new beverage segments and markets positions it well to capitalize on evolving consumer trends. However, challenges such as debt management, reliance on core brands, intense competition, and regulatory complexities must be navigated carefully. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Molson Coors can seize opportunities for growth while mitigating potential threats in the dynamic beverage industry."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

In addition to those three facilities, it operates six US breweries, including Fort Worth.', 'The company said it has excess capacity at its other five US breweries, and that it built up inventory of its product ahead of the possible strike.', '“While we respect the union’s right to strike, we have strong contingency plans and are well equipped to ensure consumers will be able to buy their favorite Molson Coors products,” said the company’s statement. It defended its offer to the union, which it said “exceeds local market rates.”', '“We remain committed to reaching an agreement that is fair to everyone,” it said.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Lyons reports to Demchak and oversees PNC's primary operating lines of business. PNC's regional presidents will report to Lyons."", 'Lyons, 53, had been head of corporate and institutional banking since he joined Pittsburgh-based PNC in October 2011. During his tenure, Lyons helped lead PNC\'s strategic acquisitions of RBC Bank (USA) in 2012 and BBVA USA in 2021. PNC also said he ""spearheaded"" the national expansion of the company\'s corporate businesses and played a key role in building out PNC\'s treasury management platform.', '""He\'s been with us for 13 years, successfully building businesses and executing our organic growth plan,"" Demchak, who was American Banker\'s 2023 Banker of the Year, said in an interview.', ""Analysts said Lyons' promotion positions him to become PNC's next CEO."", 'Lyons is ""a highly regarded executive who has been instrumental in advancing PNC\'s strategy and acquisitions,"" Piper Sandler analyst Scott Siefers said in a report. His promotion ""will solidify in investors\' minds the impression"" that Lyons would eventually succeed Demchak.', 'Stephens analyst Terry McEvoy offered a similar take. Lyons ""has been very visible and worn multiple important hats and been in charge of meaningful lines of business for PNC,"" he said in an interview. ""This was not a surprise. … It is appropriate to deepen the leadership bench and show succession planning.""', 'Demchak said he has no near-term plan to retire, but he did not discourage the succession-plan view. ""There\'s no clock that\'s ticking,"" he said. But ""we wouldn\'t have put Mike in the seat if we didn\'t have high hopes.""', 'Prior to PNC, Lyons was global head of corporate development and strategic planning for the Bank of America. He led mergers and acquisitions, the private equity business and investor relations for BofA, among other jobs. Previously, he was a portfolio manager at the investment advisor Maverick Capital, where he focused on financial institutions globally.', 'Lyons moves into the president role at a time when PNC is shifting from an expense-control mindset amid the high interest rates and lofty deposit costs of 2023 to a more aggressive strategy.', 'The company earlier this month said it would renovate more than 1,200 existing offices and open more than 100 new ones in a bid to expand in high-growth cities, in particular, including Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Miami and Denver. PNC said it would invest about $1 billion in the effort, with the new branches getting built between now and 2028. The bank currently operates approximately 2,300 branches.', '""Nothing\'s broken. We\'ll just have more amped up execution"" on growth plans in the year ahead and beyond, Lyons said in an interview.', 'Last year, PNC shuttered some branches and announced a round of job cuts to save $325 million.', 'But in 2024, Lyons said, the company will push for deposit growth in major markets with new branches while also building out revenue-driving business lines by recruiting new talent and investing in technology.', 'Demchak said he anticipates that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates three times in the second half of 2024, helping to ease pressure on deposit costs. That, combined with loan growth and expansion of other products, should drive stronger net interest income levels in coming years.', '""2025 will be a record year for NII,"" Demchak predicted for PNC.', ""He said PNC, given its scale and geographic reach, is well positioned to win market share from other banks that are downsizing or selling to peers.

He also noted Capital One Financial's proposed acquisition of Discover Financial Services."", '""The banking industry is in flux,"" Demchak said.

It posted earnings per share of $1.85 per share, down from $3.47 in the final quarter of 2022.', ""The decline was due in part to a $515 million charge to help replenish the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s Deposit Insurance Fund following the failures of three regional banks last year."", ""The bank reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, which was still below the year-earlier level by 9%, as revenue declined 7% to $5.4 billion.

Also, its sustainable capital distributions seem positive. However, an elevated cost base and commercial loan concentration are concerning.', 'PNC Financial benefits from a strong balance sheet position with loan and deposit balances rising over the years. In October 2023, the company acquired loan commitments from Signature Bank worth approximately $16 billion. The growing loan balances and a well-diversified deposit base are likely to support its financials in the upcoming period.', 'PNC expects period-end loan balances to rise 3-4% in 2024. Our model estimates total loans and deposit balances to witness a CAGR of 3.5% and 1.1%, respectively, over the next three years (until 2026).', 'High-interest rates have been supporting PNC Financial’s NII growth over the years. However, aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve led to a rise in funding costs, which weighed on NII.', 'As the Federal Reserve has signaled approximately three interest rate cuts by 2024-end, management is expecting the metric to decline in the first half of 2024. Nonetheless, the company expects improvement in the metric going forward. Growing loan balances will aid NII growth in the long term. Though we anticipate NII to decline 5% in the current year, it will rebound and rise 1.8% and 3.7% in 2025 and 2026, respectively.', 'PNC Financial remains committed to strengthening its business through strategic initiatives. In February 2024, it announced its plans to invest approximately $1 billion to open more than 100 branches and renovate more than 1,200 existing locations by 2028. Such efforts will bolster its presence in key locations as well as augment its retail banking business.', 'PNC Financial continues to progress with its capital distribution strategy. In July 2023, the company sequentially hiked quarterly cash dividends on common stock by 3.3% to $1.55 per share. Also, a 100 million share repurchase plan was authorized in second-quarter 2022. Of this, nearly 45% was available for repurchase as of Dec 31, 2023. Sustainable capital distributions are likely to stoke investors’ confidence in the stock.', 'However, PNC’s non-interest expenses have witnessed a four-year CAGR (2019-2023) of 7.3% majorly due to a rise in personnel and equipment expenditure. Though management expects adjusted non-interest expenses to decline 3-4% sequentially in first-quarter 2024 given its cost-containment efforts, a rising expense base on investments in technological advancements is likely to affect the bottom line. We estimate the metric record a three-year CAGR of 2.8%, ending in 2026.', 'The majority of PNC Financial’s loan portfolio, around 68.6% of average loans as of Dec 31, 2023, comprises commercial loans. The current rapidly changing macroeconomic backdrop is likely to put some strain on commercial lending. Moreover, in case of any economic downturn, the asset quality of these credit categories is anticipated to deteriorate. Thus, the lack of loan portfolio diversification is likely to hurt the company’s financials if the economic situation worsens.', 'Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 4.3% against the\xa0industry’s\xa07.1% growth over the past year.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'A couple of better-ranked stocks from the banking space are\xa0JPMorgan Chase & Co.\xa0JPM and\xa0Park National Corporation\xa0PRK.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This power company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +52.4%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $1.01 billion, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pinnacle West?', ""For Pinnacle West, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -93.56%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pinnacle West will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Pinnacle West would post earnings of $3.33 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.50, delivering a surprise of +5.11%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Pinnacle West doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.7%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $5.75 billion, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.02% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ross Stores?', ""For Ross Stores, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.02%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that Ross Stores will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ross Stores would post earnings of $1.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.33, delivering a surprise of +9.02%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Ross Stores appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

That's a respectable gain that exceeds the broad index's long-term track record of roughly 10% per year. Low interest rates for most of this time certainly helped."", ""One stock, Visa (NYSE: V), has crushed the S&P 500's gain by a wide margin. Shares of this top financial company have soared 393% in the past decade, thanks to a strong fundamental performance."", 'But where will Visa be 10 years from now?', 'Visa is a business that helps to facilitate the smooth functioning of commerce. It connects consumers and their banks with merchants and their banks by providing a communications channel that allows card transactions to be processed. According to Statista, Visa handles more than 60% of all card payment volume in the U.S., way ahead of second-place Mastercard.', ""Between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2023, Visa reported annualized revenue growth of 10.7%. During this 10-year stretch, there was only one year when the business posted a sales decline. That was 2020, when the global economy was hurting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, Visa has been a steady and consistent grower. And it's extremely profitable, with an operating margin exceeding 64%."", ""The company's impressive historical success has been supported by the steady proliferation of cashless transactions, particularly with the rise in popularity of credit cards and other digital forms of payment. Despite the convenience and safety of using non-cash payments, even in a developed economy like the U.S., 58% of Americans still use cash for some or all of their weekly purchases.\xa0The opportunity for Visa is even larger, unsurprisingly, in emerging markets."", ""There's no reason to believe this secular trend away from cash is abating anytime soon.

As the world economy expands, so will the volume and number of transactions that Visa handles.', ""In fiscal 2023, which ended Sept. 30, less than 8% of Visa's revenue came from additional services not directly tied to the processing of transactions. Offerings vary, ranging from risk and fraud detection to advisory and consulting services. "", ""I believe these will rise as a share of Visa's business in the years ahead. As the world becomes more and more digitized, it's critical for consumers, enterprises, and governments to find ways to stay competitive. Entering or renewing partnerships, as the business has done in Japan and Mexico, is a strategic focus."", ""From Visa's perspective, these services only help to bolster its competitive position because they can strengthen client relationships. And they can provide a stable and recurring revenue stream."", ""At a market cap of $565 billion today, I don't think Visa's returns over the next 10 years will resemble the past. That's because the bigger a business gets, the more difficult it becomes to maintain the same levels of growth."", ""Thanks to its remarkable historical performance, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.6. While that represents a large premium to the S&P 500's 22.8 multiple, it's still slightly below Visa's trailing-10-year average of 33.8.

Capital One is making a $35 billion bet that the answer will soon be: more of its credit cards.', 'The bank announced Monday evening it is acquiring Discover Financial Services (DFS) in a $35.3 billion all-stock deal. If approved by regulators and shareholders, Capital One’s (COF) acquisition will create the biggest US credit card company by loan volume.', 'So what does that mean for you?', 'For now, not a lot. Given that the deal isn’t expected to be finalized until late 2024 or early 2025, Discover and Capital One customers shouldn’t anticipate any immediate changes.', 'And antitrust regulators could push that deadline even further out: The Biden administration has established a strong anti-merger stance by attempting to block consolidation of corporate giants, from tech companies to airlines.', 'But, down the road, there could be significant transformations.', 'For starters, all Capital One debit cards will be switched from Mastercard to the Discover network “within the first few years” from when the deal is finalized, Richard Fairbank, founder and CEO of Capital One, said in a Tuesday morning investor call.', 'Discover cards are already accepted at 99% of all US merchants that allow customers to make credit card purchases, according to the company. But Fairbank said people mistakenly believe that share is a lot lower.', 'On the international side, he acknowledged that Discover’s acceptance rates are much lower compared to Visa and Mastercard. That’s one of the reasons he said Capital One will continue to do business with them, even as it builds up the Discover network.', 'The end goal, though, is to get more merchants to take Discover, he said. To do so, Capital One would likely have to lower the processing fees Discover currently charges to make it more competitive with Visa and Mastercard’s lower fees. That’s good for consumers because it means they can use their Discover cards in more places and also likely earn more rewards from those purchases.', 'With a market valuation of almost $28 billion, Discover is considerably smaller than the other three major credit card networks in the US — Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and American Express (AXP). Credit card networks are the liaison between card issuers and merchants, for whom they set fees.', 'Getting Discover, which also issues its own credit cards, unlike Visa and Mastercard, under the same roof as Capital One would give the bank a major leg up against competing credit card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), which don’t process transactions themselves.', 'As of 2022, around 42% of Capital One’s credit cards ran over Visa’s network and 58% ran over Mastercard’s, Bank of America analysts said in a Tuesday note.', 'Of the $606 billion in transactions that Capital One credit card users made last year, the analysts estimated that $255 billion came from its Visa cards, while $351 billion was from Mastercard.', 'If Capital One flips all its credit cards to Discover, Mastercard would stand to lose a quarter of its US credit card volume. Visa, on the other hand, would lose a smaller share — around 9% of its US credit card volume.', 'This could harm consumers if it results in higher fees for the balance they owe. Already, Capital One is among 15 credit card issuers that have at least one card with a maximum interest rate above 30%, according to a recent report published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.', 'Compared to other major credit card issuers, Capital One has historically catered to customers with credit scores in the 600s range, which is considered subprime. Given these borrowers are considered riskier, they tend to get charged higher interest rates compared to higher-scoring individuals.', 'The CFPB found that “lack of competition likely contributes to higher rates at the largest credit card companies.” Cards issued by smaller banks and credit unions, by contrast, can come with much lower interest rates. (Capital One did not respond to CNN’s inquiry.)', 'Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren labeled the deal “dangerous,” adding that it will “harm working people,” in a Tuesday post on X. She urged regulators to block it.', 'From a regulatory perspective, increased competition could work in Visa’s and Mastercard’s favor if it helps delay or eliminate legislation aimed at reducing the fees they collect from merchants, Jaret Seiber, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a Tuesday note.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

According to a recent Realtor.com® survey, a majority of Americans think the dream is still achievable, though for many prospective buyers, it hinges on an interest rate drop to less than 6%. Though the sentiment is generally shared across generations, for Millennials and Gen Z, there may be a little more flexibility, with nearly half (47%) of Millennials and 37% of Gen Z respondents stating they'd still buy a home if rates went above 8%."", '""The current market is very different from where it was before the pandemic, but many Americans still have a positive outlook towards achieving the dream of buying a home,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com®. ""This optimistic lens may shape the way younger shoppers in particular view mortgage rates. Although mortgage rates are up from a year ago, they have declined more than a percentage point from their recent peak. While some home shoppers and sellers are likely holding out for even lower rates, the improvement in affordability as rates fall has already ushered in an uptick in listings and contract signings.""', ""Lower Interest Rates Are the Key for Hopeful HomebuyersBuying a home is still desired and sought after, but many people are looking for mortgage rates to come down in order to achieve it. Four out of 10 Americans looking to buy a home in the next 12 months would consider it possible if rates drop below 6%. Specifically, 18% of hopeful homebuyers say buying is feasible if the mortgage rate drops below 7%--a threshold surpassed in late 2023; an additional 22% of shoppers say they can buy if the rate drops below 6%; 32%, would enter the market if rates drop below 5%; another 18% are looking for mortgage rates below 4% and the last 9% of survey respondents aren't sure what rate would make it possible for them."", ""Although rates are not anticipated to go below 6.5% according to Realtor.com's 2024 Housing Forecast, research shows that every half percent drop in the mortgage rate reduces the monthly payment for the typical home for sale by $120, a savings of $1,400 per year and $43,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage."", ""Millennials and Gen Z Remain PositiveAmongst the generations, it's clear that Millennials and Gen Z have a more positive outlook on buying a home in today's market than their predecessors. Over half of Millennials (55%) and 40% of their Gen Z counterparts feel now is a good time to buy. Whereas only 32% of Gen X and a mere 17% of Boomers feel the same."", 'Similarly, Millennials are the most optimistic about being able to afford to buy a home in the very near term with 43% saying they expect to be able to do so within the next year, compared to roughly 20% of Gen Zers and Xers, respectively and just 13% of Boomers. While Gen Z may only make up 4% of all homebuyers, according to the National Association of Realtors, they are not only bullish now, but they are the most optimistic out of the generations for the somewhat distant future. Forty-five percent of surveyed Gen Zers think they will be able to afford a home in the next five years, compared to 32% of Millennials, 36% of Gen X and 26% of Boomers; pointing to a bright and optimistic future for the up-and-coming home owners.', '""Over the last year the real estate market has made it feel less than possible for Americans to achieve the dream of owning a home,"" said Mickey Neuberger, CMO, Realtor.com®. ""Given the reality of our current environment we are seeing an inspiring level of optimism shine through, indicating that not only is the dream alive, it\'s something that the American people are still working towards, and believe they can achieve.""', 'For more details, Realtor.com® has information on the ways to make the American dream a reality from up-to-date home listings to helping consumers calculate how much house they can afford and understand the loan options available to them like assumable loans, which may provide an option for consumers looking for a lower rate.', ""About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

She left Google in 2012 to become CEO of Yahoo in an unsuccessful effort to turn around the fading internet pioneer. But Mayer still managed to triple Yahoo's stock price and create more than $30 billion in shareholder wealth before selling company's online operations to Verizon Communications in 2017."", ""Mayer, 48, now runs an artificial intelligence startup called Sunshine with Enrique Muñoz Torres — a former colleague at Google and Yahoo — from a Palo Alto, California, office that served as Facebook's first headquarters in Silicon Valley. She recently sat down for an interview with The Associated Press."", ""Q: Sunshine is using AI to manage contacts on a mobile app. Isn't that a relatively simple task for a sophisticated technology?"", ""A: Our thesis for the company is there are just a lot of mundane tasks that just get in the way. It's true for a lot of things: contacts, calendaring, scheduling, all those different components take a lot of friction. We think by applying AI – not even necessarily in cutting edge ways — you can both solve valuable problems and you can give people back time. You can also build their confidence in AI."", ""Q: So how does the Sunshine app work and since it's free, how are you going to make money?"", 'A: After you install it on your iPhone or your Android phone, we look at your contacts. Then you can hook it up to your email and we go through to see if we can recognize the signature blocks and who you correspond with many times back and forth. If it looks like you are actually engaging in conversations, we will add that person to your contacts. If you like the way we are handling your contacts, for a monthly fee of $4.99, we can go to places like LinkedIn and add things that you may not have added yourself.', 'Q: What kinds of things do you worry about with the advent of AI?', 'A: It is a very powerful technology and whenever you have a powerful technology things can go wrong. The powers are amazing, but they also introduce a whole new level of safety concern. My fears are somewhat different than some of the people who are worried about AI overlords and things like that. Mine is just we are starting to get close to technologies that approximate human intelligence.', ""When you have got a machine that is almost as intelligent as humans, the odds that humans end up getting fooled that it's real — that it isn’t a machine — just gets higher. When you have people who can’t tell what’s real anymore and what’s authentic because the machine intelligence is now approximating the human intelligence, that is really the biggest risk."", 'Q: How do you think the tech industry is doing in terms of hiring and promoting women in leadership roles?', 'A: There have been steps forward and steps back. I think the representation of women in leadership at the VP (vice president) and director level is getting better across companies. So, it feels like things are improving. Probably not as fast as I would like, but there have been steps in the right direction.', 'Q: Not long after you became Yahoo CEO, you ordered a lot of employees who were working from home to start coming into the office regularly. Has the pandemic reshaped your thinking about the work in office/at home dynamic?', 'A: I wasn’t trying to make a broad statement about work from home policies back then. I was just being blatantly honest. The company was in trouble and had been in trouble for a long time. It was a turnaround. Somewhere on the order of 1% of (Yahoo) employees had official work from home status, but when I got there 10% of the employees were informally working from home whenever they felt like it. And they didn’t have a great setup and their productivity showed it.', 'I think it is really hard to join an organization that is fully remote because that notion of culture gets lost — things like how to grow management, leadership, vision, the ability to align people around a product and plan around what you are trying to build.', 'Q: Do you still follow what is going on with Yahoo?', ""A: I do follow Yahoo. The old saying there is you bleed purple (the color of the company's old logo) once you have worked there, and I really do. I am really proud of the people who are still there and I am really proud of the people who have left and gone on to do great things across the industry. I still feel very connected to them."", '—-', 'This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.']"

The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has gained 0.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.12 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $4.59 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -2.6%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.44 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $135.65 billion and $138.59 billion estimates indicate +1.3% and +2.2% changes, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Verizon reported revenues of $35.13 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.3%.

The EPS surprise was +0.93%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price."", 'As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Verizon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

Investors today, however, are concerned about whether it can keep growing as the company is losing patent protection this decade for many of its top-selling drugs, including multiple myeloma treatment Revlimid and Eliquis, a blood clot medication. Plus, with around $37 billion in long-term debt, high interest rates are another reason investors have stayed away from the stock.', ""But there's still hope for the company as Bristol Myers has been expanding its new product portfolio.

Just give us your assessment just of where Paramount specifically stands, and when we talk about consolidation, whether or not it's inevitable that some of these smaller players need to some sort of combine or bundle up with the larger players in order to better compete."", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, I'm in the minority. If you speak to most of our institutional investors, they would say that consolidation really makes no sense, and there's good reasons for the buy side to say that. I understand why they draw that conclusion because we've already seen many rounds of consolidation with Disney Fox. We saw Warner Brothers Discovery. We saw CBS-Viacom."", ""And none of them, none of those deals sort of was the elixir that allowed them to generate copious amounts of profits in streaming. So the buy side says we're sort of done with consolidation. Even if we see more consolidation, it's not going to help any of these incumbent firms. And I think it's just dead wrong. We need another round of consolidation. It will help these incumbent firms compete with the likes of Netflix."", '- How will that consolidation then, from your purview, change the pricing mechanisms that these companies put forward to consumers?', ""JASON BAZINET: You know, I don't think it's so much about pricing per se. I would say that we went through a chapter, I'll call it 2019 through 2021-ish, where it was just give away the product, trying get as many subs as you can to get scale. And we're now in a chapter where a lot of these media companies are saying, look, we can't generate losses forever in streaming. We're going to take pricing up."", 'So if we see another round of consolidation, I think pricing will go up for the video streaming apps, but it would go up anyway. What we really are focused on is more about the cost savings that you get with consolidation, and equally critical, just rationalizing the number of apps that are out in the marketplace. We just have too many video apps.', ""- Jason, talk to us just a little bit more about what that cost savings perspective, what that's going to do, how much will it really save some of these media players in the long run."", ""JASON BAZINET: Yeah. Typically, it runs a low single digit percentage of the cost structure of the pro forma firm. So it's billions of dollars, no matter which combination you envisage."", ""- And so with that in mind, I mean, we're already hearing as well that there's going to be some potential pushback from the DOJ if there's more of this consolidation effort that goes forward. Where do you think that companies will have to strike the right tone in their messaging to regulators as well?"", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, I don't know. It's pretty interesting because the regulators have a propensity to almost be too backward-looking, right? And so there certainly is some risk that you'll get regulatory pushback. I can tell you the way the institutional investors are looking at it is the real competition is really from the tech giants that are getting into the streaming business, whether that's an Apple or an Amazon."", ""And so the buy side doesn't really look at consolidation as a constraint. But sometimes, the regulators tend to be a little bit backward-looking and might say, there's too much consolidation, but I think that would be the wrong answer.""]"

You know, in that complaint, Fubo is talking about how they were being forced to air other content in order to get to the good sports content. So that's interesting, kind of like twisting their arm. You know, the big question here is also, if it's going to be an FTC antitrust, is it-- is this thing bad for consumers, right? Is it-- is it going to harm them by higher prices, less selection, less sports content? And was the FTC even planning to sue anyway?"", ""We'll see.

People don't-- we don't know yet exactly how consumers are going to respond to this type of service and the amount of money that they're going to be willing to pay."", ""JOSH SCHAFER: I pay the 40 bucks, I've said it."", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: I know you would.', ""JOSH SCHAFER: I'd pay the 40 bucks."", 'pras subramanian: So do you think that Fubo jumped the gun here?

This coming amid several potential strategic options at the entertainment company is pursuing all according to a report here from the Wall Street Journal. Here with more on the path forward for not only Paramount but also several of the other media giants, we want to bring in Citi managing director Jason Bazinet.', ""Jason, it's great to see you again, so let's start on that journal report here from last week. Just give us your assessment just of where Paramount specifically stands, and when we talk about consolidation, whether or not it's inevitable that some of these smaller players need to some sort of combine or bundle up with the larger players in order to better compete."", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, I'm in the minority. If you speak to most of our institutional investors, they would say that consolidation really makes no sense, and there's good reasons for the buy side to say that. I understand why they draw that conclusion because we've already seen many rounds of consolidation with Disney Fox. We saw Warner Brothers Discovery. We saw CBS-Viacom."", ""And none of them, none of those deals sort of was the elixir that allowed them to generate copious amounts of profits in streaming. So the buy side says we're sort of done with consolidation. Even if we see more consolidation, it's not going to help any of these incumbent firms. And I think it's just dead wrong. We need another round of consolidation. It will help these incumbent firms compete with the likes of Netflix."", '- How will that consolidation then, from your purview, change the pricing mechanisms that these companies put forward to consumers?', ""JASON BAZINET: You know, I don't think it's so much about pricing per se. I would say that we went through a chapter, I'll call it 2019 through 2021-ish, where it was just give away the product, trying get as many subs as you can to get scale. And we're now in a chapter where a lot of these media companies are saying, look, we can't generate losses forever in streaming. We're going to take pricing up."", 'So if we see another round of consolidation, I think pricing will go up for the video streaming apps, but it would go up anyway. What we really are focused on is more about the cost savings that you get with consolidation, and equally critical, just rationalizing the number of apps that are out in the marketplace. We just have too many video apps.', ""- Jason, talk to us just a little bit more about what that cost savings perspective, what that's going to do, how much will it really save some of these media players in the long run."", ""JASON BAZINET: Yeah. Typically, it runs a low single digit percentage of the cost structure of the pro forma firm. So it's billions of dollars, no matter which combination you envisage."", ""- And so with that in mind, I mean, we're already hearing as well that there's going to be some potential pushback from the DOJ if there's more of this consolidation effort that goes forward. Where do you think that companies will have to strike the right tone in their messaging to regulators as well?"", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, I don't know. It's pretty interesting because the regulators have a propensity to almost be too backward-looking, right? And so there certainly is some risk that you'll get regulatory pushback. I can tell you the way the institutional investors are looking at it is the real competition is really from the tech giants that are getting into the streaming business, whether that's an Apple or an Amazon."", ""And so the buy side doesn't really look at consolidation as a constraint. But sometimes, the regulators tend to be a little bit backward-looking and might say, there's too much consolidation, but I think that would be the wrong answer.""]"

The higher this score, the higher the movie ranks on our list. As a tie-breaker, we used the ratings of movies on IMDB.

What could this potential merger mean for the greater media landscape and other streaming platforms?"", 'Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet joins Yahoo Finance Live to take a closer look at what this could mean for competition.', '“I’m in the minority” states Bazinet who suggests that consolidation could be one way to “compete with the likes of Netflix.” With one major concern being pricing for consolidation, Bazinet stated that “pricing will go up,” but insists that consolidation ensures cost savings because “we have too many apps.”', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim"", '- Paramount Plus and Peacock reportedly in talks to join forces amid an increasingly competitive streaming landscape. This coming amid several potential strategic options at the entertainment company is pursuing all according to a report here from the Wall Street Journal. Here with more on the path forward for not only Paramount but also several of the other media giants, we want to bring in Citi managing director Jason Bazinet.', ""Jason, it's great to see you again, so let's start on that journal report here from last week. Just give us your assessment just of where Paramount specifically stands, and when we talk about consolidation, whether or not it's inevitable that some of these smaller players need to some sort of combine or bundle up with the larger players in order to better compete."", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, I'm in the minority. If you speak to most of our institutional investors, they would say that consolidation really makes no sense, and there's good reasons for the buy side to say that. I understand why they draw that conclusion because we've already seen many rounds of consolidation with Disney Fox. We saw Warner Brothers Discovery. We saw CBS-Viacom."", ""And none of them, none of those deals sort of was the elixir that allowed them to generate copious amounts of profits in streaming. So the buy side says we're sort of done with consolidation. Even if we see more consolidation, it's not going to help any of these incumbent firms. And I think it's just dead wrong. We need another round of consolidation. It will help these incumbent firms compete with the likes of Netflix."", '- How will that consolidation then, from your purview, change the pricing mechanisms that these companies put forward to consumers?', ""JASON BAZINET: You know, I don't think it's so much about pricing per se. I would say that we went through a chapter, I'll call it 2019 through 2021-ish, where it was just give away the product, trying get as many subs as you can to get scale. And we're now in a chapter where a lot of these media companies are saying, look, we can't generate losses forever in streaming. We're going to take pricing up."", 'So if we see another round of consolidation, I think pricing will go up for the video streaming apps, but it would go up anyway. What we really are focused on is more about the cost savings that you get with consolidation, and equally critical, just rationalizing the number of apps that are out in the marketplace. We just have too many video apps.', ""- Jason, talk to us just a little bit more about what that cost savings perspective, what that's going to do, how much will it really save some of these media players in the long run."", ""JASON BAZINET: Yeah. Typically, it runs a low single digit percentage of the cost structure of the pro forma firm. So it's billions of dollars, no matter which combination you envisage."", ""- And so with that in mind, I mean, we're already hearing as well that there's going to be some potential pushback from the DOJ if there's more of this consolidation effort that goes forward. Where do you think that companies will have to strike the right tone in their messaging to regulators as well?"", ""JASON BAZINET: Well, I don't know. It's pretty interesting because the regulators have a propensity to almost be too backward-looking, right? And so there certainly is some risk that you'll get regulatory pushback. I can tell you the way the institutional investors are looking at it is the real competition is really from the tech giants that are getting into the streaming business, whether that's an Apple or an Amazon."", ""And so the buy side doesn't really look at consolidation as a constraint. But sometimes, the regulators tend to be a little bit backward-looking and might say, there's too much consolidation, but I think that would be the wrong answer.""]"

As we normally do, I will open the call with some overview comments on the quarter. I will then turn it back over to Rob to comment on detailed operating results, cash flow as well as comment on outlook. We will then review our market and strategy-related comments, after which we will open it up to Q&A. This afternoon, we reported total revenues of $72.4 million and revenues before reimbursement of $71.2 million, which was above the high end of our guidance and adjusted earnings per share of $0.39, which was also above the high end of our guidance. Our results were driven by the performance of our Oracle Solutions segment, which was up strongly. This is consistent with the momentum that we have experienced in that segment since the second quarter. A new important development for the segment is the notable increase in demand that we're experiencing in our historically strong Enterprise Performance Management offering. Our global S&BT segment was up when compared to last year. Although the segment was impacted by market conditions, we continue to see an increased interest in Gen AI initiatives. More importantly, our recently launched Gen AI assessment platform, AI Explorer, is receiving favorable feedback. It has led to a significant number of new client wins, enabling us to showcase our unique ability to assess readiness and identify organizational transformation opportunities. We are leveraging our rapidly growing use case repository to establish Gen AI road maps with related benefit case analysis using our highly recognized benchmark data base. The rapidly emerging Gen AI interest is creating an entirely new way to engage clients broadly and strategically. AI Explorer is creating a unique opportunity to expand our trusted performance improvement access to become strategic architects of our clients' Gen AI journey. Our SAP Solutions segment continued its solid performance, but was down on a year-over-year basis as the sales investments we made during the year did not start to generate revenues until the end of the year. However, this should benefit the first half of 2024. We also continue to aggressively invest in our growing -- in growing our IP-based programs. We are enhancing the product architecture and pricing of our existing executive advisory programs resulting in a more powerful combination of highly focused IP and access to expert practitioners, emphasizing our advisor expertise and applied knowledge research. All of our executive advisory programs are now delivered through our new member platform, Hackett Connect, which fully launched in October. This new state-of-the-art platform allows all of our existing and new members to avail themselves to our experts, research, benchmarking metrics as well as our best practices IP. While our pipeline for these offerings continues to increase, our conversion rates were lower than what we expected during the year. We believe the lower conversion rates were primarily due to the large number of new hires during the year and their lack of familiarity with our offering. In 2023, annual contract value grew 2%, but we expect all of the foundational work we did in 2023 to lead to increasing growth in 2024. On the balance sheet side, in the short term, you could expect us to use our strong cash flow from operations to continue to pay down our outstanding balance of our credit facility. Longer term, we plan to use our balance sheet by using our current credit facility to fund acquisitions and to buy back stock while continuing to invest in our business. With that said, let me ask Rob to provide details on our operating results, cash flow and also comment on outlook. I will make additional comments on strategy and market conditions following Rob's comments. Rob?"", 'Robert A. Ramirez', ""Thank you, Ted. As I typically do, I'll cover the following topics during this portion of the call. I'll cover an overview of our 2023 fourth quarter results, along with an overview of related key operating statistics. I'll also cover an overview of our cash flow activities during the quarter, and I'll conclude with a discussion on our financial outlook for the first quarter of 2024. For purposes of this call, I will comment separately regarding the revenues of our global S&BT segment, our Oracle Solutions segment, our SAP Solutions segment and the total company. Our global S&BT segment includes the results of our North America and international IPaaS and benchmark offerings, our executive advisory programs, our business transformation and our OneStream and group offerings. Our Oracle Solutions and our SAP Solutions segments include the results of our Oracle and SAP offerings, respectively. Please note that we will be referencing both total revenues and revenues before reimbursements in our discussion. Reimbursable expenses are primarily project travel-related expenses passed through to our clients that have no associated impact to our profitability. During our call today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information to investors. We have included reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release filed earlier today and will post any additional information based on the discussion from this call to the Investor Relations page of the company's website. For the fourth quarter of 2023, as Ted mentioned, our total revenue was $72.4 million, up 3% over the prior year. Our revenues before reimbursements were $71.2 million, which was also above the high end of our quarterly guidance, up 3% over the prior year. The fourth quarter reimbursable expense ratio on revenues before reimbursements was 1.7% as compared to 1.6% in the prior quarter and 1.9% when compared to the same period in the prior year. Total revenues from our global S&BT segment were $42.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenues before reimbursements for our global S&BT segment were $41.6 million for the fourth quarter of '23, an increase of 3% when compared to the same period in the prior year. Total revenues from our Oracle Solutions segment were $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenues before reimbursements for our Oracle Solutions segment were $18.4 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 10.6% when compared to the same period in the prior year. This is consistent with the momentum we've experienced since the second quarter of '23, with strong double-digit growth over the last 2 quarters when compared to prior year periods. Total revenues from our SAP Solutions segment were $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of '23. Revenues before reimbursements for our SAP Solutions segment were $11.1 million for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 5% when compared to the same period in the prior year, consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter. The sales investments we made during '23 are expected to contribute to growth in 2024. Approximately 24% of our total company revenues before reimbursements consist of recurring multiyear and subscription-based revenues, which includes our executive advisory, IP as a service, multiyear benchmarks and application managed services contracts. Total company adjusted cost of sales, which exclude reimbursable expenses and noncash stock-based compensation expense, totaled $40.3 million or 56.7% of revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $37.8 million or 54.9% of revenues before reimbursements in the prior year. Total company consultant headcount was 1,168 at the end of the fourth quarter as compared to a total company consultant headcount of 1,177 in the previous quarter and 1,128 at the end of the fourth quarter of the prior year. Total company adjusted gross margin on revenues before reimbursements, which excludes reimbursable expenses and noncash stock-based compensation expense, was 43.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to 45.1% in the prior year period. This decrease is primarily due to increased head count and lower utilization in the fourth quarter. Adjusted SG&A, which excludes noncash stock-based compensation expense and our Gartner legal settlement and related costs, was $15.4 million or 21.6% of revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of '23. This is compared to $14.9 million or 21.7% of revenues before reimbursements in the prior year. The year-over-year absolute dollar increase is primarily due to incremental investments we're making and dedicated sales resources for executive advisory service offerings. These investments approximated $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash stock-based compensation expense and the onetime legal settlement previously mentioned and related costs, was $16.3 million or 23% of revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of '23 as compared to $16.9 million or 24.5% of revenues before reimbursements in the prior year. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of '23 totaled $7.9 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.28 in compares to GAAP net income of $9.7 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.31 in the fourth quarter of the previous year. GAAP net income includes a onetime legal settlement and related costs of $1.2 million or $0.03 per diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income, which excludes noncash stock-based compensation expense and the legal settlement for the fourth quarter of 2023, totaled $10.8 million or adjusted diluted net income per common share of $0.39, which was above the high end of our earnings guidance range. This compares to adjusted net income of $11.5 million or adjusted diluted net income per common share of $0.36 in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The company's cash balances were $21 million at the end of the fourth quarter of '23 as compared to $9.9 million at the end of the previous quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $25.6 million, primarily driven by net income adjusted for noncash activity and decreases in accounts receivable and related days sales outstanding. Our DSO at the end of the quarter was 65 days as compared to 75 days at the end of the previous quarter and as compared to 63 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. During the quarter, the company paid down $11 million on our credit facility. The balance of the company's total debt outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $33 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $641,000. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3,000 shares of the company's stock from employees to satisfy income tax withholding triggered by the vesting of restricted stock -- of restricted shares for an average of $23.08 per share at a total cost of approximately $71,000. Our remaining stock repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter was $13.9 million. At its most recent meeting, subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company's Board of Directors declared the first quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share for its shareholders of record on March 22, 2024, to be paid on April 5, 2024. I'm now going to move to discussing the guidance for our first quarter of 2024. Before I do that, I'd like to remind everyone of the seasonality of our business relative to costs as we move sequentially from Q4 to Q1. Specifically, consistent with first quarter guidance provided in previous years, our first quarter guidance for 2024 will reflect the sequential increase in U.S. payroll-related taxes and the sequential buildup of our vacation accruals. The company estimates total revenue before reimbursements for the first quarter of 2024 to be in the range of $72.5 million to $74 million. We expect all 3 segment revenues before reimbursements to be up when compared to the prior year with Oracle Solutions up strongly. We estimate adjusted diluted net income per common share in the first quarter of 2024 to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.39, which assumes a GAAP effective tax rate on adjusted earnings of 22%. We expect adjusted gross margin on revenues before reimbursements to be approximately 40.6% to 41.4%. We expect adjusted SG&A and interest expense to be approximately $16.8 million. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA on revenues before reimbursements to in the range of approximately 20% to 21%. Lastly, we expect cash balances, excluding the impact of share buyback activity, to be tempered due to the payment of 2023 performance-related bonuses and the payment of the employee income taxable withholding triggered by net vesting of restricted shares. At this point, I would like to turn it back over to Ted to review our market outlook and our strategic priorities for the coming months. Ted?"", 'Ted A. Fernandez', ""Thank you, Rob. As we look forward, let me share our thoughts on the near and long-term demand environment and the growth opportunities it offers our organization. Although demand for digital transformation remains strong, it continues to be impacted by extended decision-making as organizations assess competing priorities created by high interest rates and the demand disruption, which it is intended to affect. Digital innovation and enterprise cloud applications, analytics and artificial intelligence as well as workflow automation are dramatically influencing the way businesses compete to deliver their services. So what's new? It's the rapidly emerging attention and demand for Gen AI. Its possibly unlimited potential will drive an entirely new level of digital world-class performance standards, driving all software and services providers to extend the value of their existing offerings. We believe this will result in an unprecedented innovation, which all organizations will have to consider. On the talent side, competition for experienced executives continues. Overall, we saw the turnover continue to moderate and remained low during the quarter, and we expect that trend to continue. Longer term, we have transitioned to a hybrid sales and delivery model, which provides effective access to our clients and their respective teams. This hybrid model provides our associates with greater personal flexibility to perform their defined responsibilities remotely, which is very valuable to them. This should allow us to attract and retain talent. Strategically, we have accelerated our focus on our recurring high-margin IP-related services by increasing the development of new programs and sales and marketing resources dedicated to this area. We also continue to invest on our new Hackett Connect member platform. But what is new is the accelerated focus and investments we are making in our Gen AI capabilities. We are utilizing the AI Explorer platform as the vehicle to integrate the Gen AI impact across all of our offerings. We have also hired critical data and technology architecture resources to further support our efforts. This will allow us to become critical architects, advisors and consultants of our clients' Gen AI journey. Our ability to measure and assess the impact of Gen AI utilizing our growing use case repository, along with market intelligence about the respective Gen AI solution providers is a powerful way to help guide our clients through the unlimited opportunities they will have to consider. We see this as an opportunity for our organization to provide an objective business perspective to what thus far has been primarily a technology innovation story. We continue to see strong downstream revenues from our benchmarking and executive advisory clients to our business transformation and cloud application consulting services. This halo effect has been approximately over 40% for the last several years. We believe this will only be expanded by our AI Explorer offering. Organizations who rely on our assessment, solutioning and market intelligence platforms are also more likely to utilize our advisory and consulting services. We also continue to publish our market intelligence reports with the most recent reports focused on finance and accounting outsourcing, several dimensions of Enterprise Performance Management and customer to receivables creation. Our unique insight is our ability to measure value realization and provide implementation insight that accelerates a customer's business performance. We will soon publish our research reports on Gen AI and key solution providers, which is important content for AI Explorer and our executive advisory program. Our market intelligence report represent critical value to providers. The companies learn how they compare to competitors as well as the measurable impact their solutions deliver. Our large benchmarking and consulting and executive advisory customer base can also acquire the market intelligence reports to inform software and services purchases decision. We are also exploring strategic partnerships that will allow us to sell our IP through new channels. This will allow us to reach beyond our current Global 1000 focus in an efficient manner. We also continue to redefine our global benchmarking leadership through enhancements in Quantum Leap, our digital benchmark software-as-a-service solution along with our digital transformation platforms. These platforms allow us to deliver more information with significantly less client effort. It also allows clients to leverage our IP to create compelling benefit case assessment, accelerating process flow and software configuration decisions and track the value realization of transformation initiatives. We believe the integration of these platforms with AI Explorer significantly enhances the value of our IP and fully aligns our perspective on the new digital world-class performance standards that will be achieved due to emerging Gen AI technology and related use cases. As I mentioned on previous calls, we have a 20-minute demo in the Investor Relations page of our website that investors can utilize to become more familiar with the capabilities of our Quantum Leap and DTP platforms. We are also adding videos that preview our Hackett Connect and AI Explorer platforms. Lastly, even though we believe that we have the client base and the offerings to grow our business, we continue to look for acquisitions and alliances that strategically leverage our IP and add scope, scale or capability, which can accelerate our growth. As always, let me close by congratulating our associates on our performance and by thanking them for their tireless efforts and always urge them to stay highly focused on our clients and our people no matter what challenges they may encounter. Those conclude my comments. Let me turn it over to our operator, and let us move on to the Q&A section of our call."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) George Sutton with Craig-Hallum.', 'George Frederick Sutton', ""Ted, I wondered if you could walk through how you take AI Explorer into a company, do some work for them and then how it extends into your broader offering? I'm particularly compelled by the thought that it's an entirely new way to engage clients as you said. Can you just walk through exactly how that works?"", 'Ted A. Fernandez', ""Okay. Let me do that. And first, let me also comment on the fact that you are correct that this emerging demand requires all software and services providers to, I will say, be prominent and active in this channel if they want to have an opportunity to engage clients strategically, which is only going to increase. So this AI Explorer effort for us has been very, very significant and it's received -- we've had in terms of number of meetings scheduled, held and even the level of proposals we've issued to date all are more significant than any other, I'll call it, new release that we have ever launched. But with that said, it's -- we take our business process taxonomy, we evaluated cradle to grave as you know, for all of our benchmarking and digital transformation IP, we look at the enterprise across over 100 processes. We align those processes and compare the individual functions and activities against the Gen AI technologies which are emerging. So you look at the fact that if you're building a large language model, leveraging machine learning, leveraging neural networks, leveraging a chatbot or a digital assistant in some combination or strategic way, how does that impact both functions and activities? We've been doing this review for more than 6 months. We've identified hundreds of use cases. So it's allowed us to: one, evaluate functions and activities for the level of Gen AI if we wanted to call impact. We then compare that opportunity for a client against the client's actual cost, time, service levels that they're achieving. It allows us again to use that measurement capability that exists in Quantum Leap to not only tell the client which activities we believe will drive the highest value, we can compare that value to the numbers that they're currently incurring, so that it results in a benefit case. We can do that. We can then also use our growing use case repository to prioritize these opportunities for clients, again, at a functional -- bifunctional group throughout the enterprise and then -- help the client then establish priorities. A client can decide that it wants to simply walk what we would be calling workforce productivity or an incremental impact. It could -- client to be more aggressive and look at something more transformative or the client can be highly ambitious and do something that would be very breakthrough. But as everyone is finding out, the investments required to actually achieve some of the breakthrough performance requires data harmonization that will support these large language models in order for them to have the intended impact. So we see the clients deciding how they want to start. But at the same time, clients that are very serious about this are really looking at their data standards and harmonization of data efforts that will allow them to position the most breakthrough innovation that Gen AI will offer. So what I like the most about it since we've been in front of clients and now over the last week in front of -- in proposal scenarios with other providers is that we see the story really being framed from a technology perspective. And we believe that most of the clients are looking for somebody to bring a business perspective, how to prioritize, what's the impact, what's the organizational impact, all of the things that we do very strongly. So for us, it's been a rapid, if you wanted, move to take all of our IP, benchmarking assets, Quantum Leap and DTP as well as the research that people can now avail themselves through Hackett Connect and make sure that they're being enveloped by this new JI innovation and activity that the clients must consider. We think it is a significant effort. It will be a significant effort for us throughout the year. But boy, I think we're pretty happy that we launched Explorer before the end of the year and the activity that we've seen since the beginning of the year has been very promising."", 'George Frederick Sutton', ""That's very helpful detail. So I wondered on the market intelligence side, how much has that -- and there wasn't a lot of discussion on market intelligence on this call or at least the prepared comments. I'm curious how much impact this Gartner issue has caused from that perspective, if any. Could you just walk through that for us?"", 'Ted A. Fernandez', ""None. The Gartner issue, as you referred to it, was a, I would call it, more recruiting related where individuals that we hired, a very important one, the head of sales individual had a noncompete agreement, which was enforced in Connecticut. So we took them out of any direct sales-related activity that would compete with Gartner, and he will be precluded from returning to his head of global executive advisory sales until November 6, which is when that -- his 1-year period ends. We were very fortunate. We were hiring a second leader to support some of our other renewals and customer service issues, very talented individual, which replaced this individual 2 weeks after we got that notice from the court that they believe that the -- their position was enforceable. We made that transition. We think we've addressed that about as smoothly as we can. And as I said in my prepared comments, it may have disrupted or impacted, right, to ask a leader not be here at the end of the year, lead the team. But I referred to the interim head as a little bit of a Brock Purdy. No flash, just great execution, and we're delighted to have him on board. Therefore, we're looking forward to the investments we make in '23 to impact '24, but it had no impact on our development of market intelligence reports and how we intend to use them to support our executive advisory programs and now becomes a critical part of AI Explorer because a lot of the AI Explorer questions are not only what's my opportunity, how do I prioritize? But they also want a perspective of which vendors do what well and therefore, who they should consider. And I believe that they will rely on us, on that market intelligence element of our business to support Gen AI initiatives."", 'George Frederick Sutton', ""Got you. So he can't come back until November 6. Just make sure he gets out and votes the next day on November 7. Thanks, guys."", 'Ted A. Fernandez', ""He's ready to go. Don't worry, we'll keep him busy in things that do not conflict with this agreement."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next caller is Jeff Martin with ROTH MKM.', 'Jeffrey Michael Martin', 'Ted, I wondered if you could elaborate on what you see as a growth acceleration in 2024. Maybe first touch on the sources of that. Is it giving more seasoned salespeople, not having them become more seasoned and therefore conversion rates go up? Is it new offering, is this a combination? In detail that would be helpful.', 'Ted A. Fernandez', 'Yes. I mean all of the above, obviously, time and great help. During the year, we were also changing and improving some of the programs. So they were not only becoming familiar with our relative strength in how to take those to market, but we were obviously even rolling out some enhancements, which included the November -- October rollout of Hackett Connect. So again, tremendous amount of work and investment that we made. So even with some disruption, listen, it should not prevent us from are growing that -- those services the way we originally intended.', 'Jeffrey Michael Martin', 'Great. And then back to market intelligence a little bit, if we could. Are you seeing much revenue impact from the programs? I mean, you published the first couple of them towards the middle or even in the fall of last year. It sounds like you published another $0.01 or $0.02 and kind of the cadence of $0.01 or $0.02 a quarter plan for the foreseeable future.', 'Ted A. Fernandez', 'No. We project that, as you know, very low revenue since we need these programs would be rolling out in the latter part of the year. So the answer is no. But again, we expect them to contribute to our growth in 2024.', 'Jeffrey Michael Martin', 'Okay. And then could you care to quantify growth acceleration in 2024. How should we think about the model? I know typically, you target a 5% revenue growth and 10% pro forma EPS growth. Is that how we should think about this year? Or should we think about an acceleration where the back half is perhaps stronger than that?', 'Ted A. Fernandez', ""Well, as you know, we'll provide the quarterly guidance, we'll set the same. We know that at 5% growth, we obviously generate profits in excess of 10%. If we grow anywhere near 10%, we're 20% bottom line contribution. We'll provide our quarterly guidance and allow that to play out, and we'll update that for you every quarter as we go through as we normally do. So no, if you're asking me to provide annual guidance, Jeff, no -- I'm not prepared to change my discipline at the moment."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Vincent Colicchio with Barrington Research.', 'Vincent Alexander Colicchio', ""So Ted, I'm curious, the sales force. My understanding is bundling of services is one of their focuses. Are you seeing some success there? And if not, do you expect to see some success in that area throughout the year?"", 'Ted A. Fernandez', ""Well, it depends which sales force you're talking about. If it's our regional sales group that supports our S&BT segment, and that includes all services, the answer is yes. They carry a bag to support the sale of all services. If you're talking about the executive advisory and market intelligence dedicated sales group, they're fully focused on those offerings, but they obviously receive incentives to the extent that they identify other opportunities that are outside of their purview. And then our software-related teams work directly with those channel partners and those -- that the software companies support and they primarily focus on the sale of those software products across the U.S. regions for both Oracle and SAP."", 'Vincent Alexander Colicchio', ""And Rob, I don't -- I wasn't sure if I missed it. You had said Oracle should grow sequentially. Did you mention the S&BT and SAP sequentially in Q1?"", 'Robert A. Ramirez', 'Yes, my comment was that all 3 of our segments are going to grow in Q1 with the strongest being Oracle.', 'Vincent Alexander Colicchio', 'Okay. And Ted, do you expect Q1 to see better conversion rates with the new sales force? Or will it take more time than that?', 'Ted A. Fernandez', 'Yes, we do expect it to improve. In fact, it improved throughout the year, as you can see, the time and greater the individuals become familiar with the product. So yes, we would expect it to improve throughout the year, including Q1.', 'Vincent Alexander Colicchio', ""And I know you don't want to talk about growth for the year. Maybe there's another way to ask a related question. Do you expect a return on the sales investments you made last year and the market intelligence investments to bear fruit in '24?"", 'Ted A. Fernandez', 'Absolutely.', 'Operator', 'And at this time, I show no further questions. I would now turn the call back over to Mr. Fernandez.', 'Ted A. Fernandez', 'Let me thank everyone for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. We look forward to catching up with you again when we report the first quarter. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""And thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.""]"

With a vast network of over 3,000 self-storage facilities across 40 states and a market capitalization of approximately $43.99 billion as of June 30, 2023, PSA continues to solidify its market leadership. The company's financial tables reflect a robust business model, with significant investments in technology and customer experience enhancements, contributing to its strong financial performance. The filing also outlines PSA's strategic growth initiatives, including acquisitions, development of new facilities, and expansion of ancillary services such as tenant reinsurance and third-party management. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in the 10-K filing, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of PSA's market position and future prospects."", ""Brand Recognition and Market Leadership: Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) stands as the largest owner of self-storage facilities in the U.S., commanding approximately 9% of the country's self-storage square footage. This scale, coupled with the iconic orange color and recognizable brand, gives PSA a significant competitive advantage. The company's brand awareness is a testament to its long-standing presence and marketing efforts, which have translated into high occupancy levels and the ability to command premium pricing."", ""Technological Advancements: PSA's investment in technology has revolutionized the customer experience, with approximately 81% of move-ins in 2023 sourced through its website. The eRental process and Public Storage App further streamline the rental process, enhancing convenience and operational efficiency. These digital tools not only improve customer satisfaction but also contribute to revenue optimization and cost savings."", ""Financial Strength: The company's financial health is robust, with a market capitalization of $43.99 billion as of mid-2023. PSA's financial stability is underpinned by its ability to generate high operating margins and maintain a low level of administrative costs relative to revenues. This financial strength provides the flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and weather economic downturns."", ""High Fragmentation and Competition: Despite being the market leader, the self-storage industry's high fragmentation means that PSA faces significant competition from regional and local operators. This competition can impact rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses. While PSA's scale and brand offer advantages, the company must continuously innovate to maintain its market position against numerous smaller competitors."", ""Dependence on Economic Conditions: The performance of self-storage facilities is closely tied to economic conditions, including employment rates and housing markets. Economic downturns can lead to decreased demand for storage space, affecting PSA's revenue and profitability. The company's reliance on such external factors poses a risk to its financial stability during economic contractions."", ""Regulatory Compliance Costs: PSA's operations are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations, including environmental, labor, and health and safety laws. Compliance with these regulations can result in significant costs, and any changes in the regulatory landscape could adversely affect the company's operations and financial performance."", ""Acquisitions and Development: PSA's knowledge of major U.S. markets and its financial resources position it well to capitalize on the fragmented nature of the self-storage industry through strategic acquisitions and development of new facilities. The company's aggressive growth strategies aim to leverage its scale and expertise to expand its footprint and enhance its market share."", ""Ancillary Business Growth: The expansion of PSA's tenant reinsurance and third-party management services presents opportunities for additional revenue streams. Initiatives like the Savvy Storage Insurance Program can attract other storage facility owners, increasing PSA's influence in the industry and providing growth beyond traditional self-storage operations."", 'Technological Innovation: Continued investment in technology can further differentiate PSA from competitors. Innovations in customer experience, operational efficiency, and revenue management can drive growth and profitability, positioning PSA as a forward-thinking leader in the self-storage industry.', ""Intense Industry Competition: The self-storage industry's competitive landscape is constantly evolving, with new entrants and existing operators expanding their presence. PSA must navigate this competition to retain its market leadership, requiring ongoing investment in marketing, technology, and customer service to stay ahead."", 'Regulatory and Environmental Risks: Changes in regulations, particularly those related to environmental stewardship, can impose additional operational and financial burdens on PSA. The company must manage these risks proactively to ensure compliance and mitigate potential impacts on its business model and reputation.', ""Economic Fluctuations: The self-storage industry is sensitive to economic cycles, and PSA's performance is not immune to these fluctuations. Economic downturns can lead to reduced demand for storage, impacting rental income and occupancy rates. PSA must remain agile and responsive to economic trends to maintain its financial health."", ""In conclusion, Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) exhibits a strong market presence, bolstered by its brand recognition, technological advancements, and financial stability. However, the company must navigate the challenges of a highly competitive and fragmented industry, economic sensitivity, and regulatory compliance. PSA's opportunities for growth through acquisitions, development, and ancillary business activities are promising, but it must remain"", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

It went through several boom-and-bust cycles in its 40-year history as a public company, but it still turned a $1,000 investment in its initial public offering into nearly $57,000."", ""Micron now has a market cap of $88 billion. It's still smaller than Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, which are worth $184 billion and $281 billion, respectively; and Nvidia, which recently saw its market cap hit $1.8 trillion."", ""But could Micron surprise investors and become the next trillion-dollar chipmaker by the end of this decade? Let's review its business model, growth rates, and valuations to decide."", ""Micron is the world's third-largest supplier of DRAM chips and the fifth-largest supplier of NAND chips. South Korea's Samsung leads both markets, but its DRAM and NAND chips still trail slightly behind Micron's in terms of transistor density and power efficiency. In its latest quarter, Micron generated 73% of its revenue from DRAM chips, 26% from NAND chips, and the remaining sliver from other types of memory chips."", ""Over the past two years, Micron's sales of DRAM and NAND chips declined as it grappled with declining PC shipments in a post-pandemic market, the end of the 5G upgrade cycle, and macro headwinds for the industrial market. The Chinese government also barred the country's key infrastructure providers from buying Micron's chips as its tech war with the U.S. and Europe escalated. Those headwinds offset the stronger growth of its artificial intelligence (AI) and automotive markets."", ""Micron's revenue rose 29% in fiscal 2021 (which ended in September 2020), but it grew just 11% in fiscal 2022 and plunged 49% in fiscal 2023. However, analysts expect 46% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 as the macro environment warms up, the PC and smartphone markets stabilize, the industrial and auto markets expand, and the explosive growth of the generative AI market drives more data centers to upgrade their memory chips alongside Nvidia's GPUs."", ""Analysts expect Micron's revenue to grow another 40% in fiscal 2025, but rise just 9% to $34.5 billion in fiscal 2026 as the growth cycle cools down. That would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of just 2.9% from fiscal 2022."", ""These volatile cycles make it difficult to gauge Micron's long-term growth potential, but we know its revenue grew at a steady CAGR of 5.5% from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2023 through two major cyclical downturns. Looking ahead, Industry Research Biz expects the global DRAM and NAND markets to expand at a combined CAGR of 5.9% from 2023 to 2029."", ""Based on those estimates, we can conservatively assume that Micron will grow its revenue at a CAGR of 5% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2030 -- which would boost its annual revenue to about $42 billion by the final year. Micron is reasonably valued right now at about 4 times this year's sales -- so if its valuation holds steady, it could be worth $168 billion by 2030. That means its stock would nearly double from its current levels, but it could take a few more decades to join the four-comma club."", ""Micron won't become a trillion-dollar chipmaker over the next six years, but I believe it's still a sound way to profit from the long-term expansion of the PC, mobile, AI, industrial, and automotive markets as they gobble up more memory chips. It still faces tough competition and is more prone to cyclical downturns than many other chipmakers, but investors who ride its stock through the next few boom-and-bust cycles could be well rewarded."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

It leases space in its warehouses to tenants across various industries. Those leases supply it with steady rental income. It uses that money to pay a growing dividend (currently yielding 2.6%) and invest in expanding its portfolio.

Realty Income expects to continue boosting its dividend in the future. ', ""The company aims to grow its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by 4% to 5% per year. Growth drivers include rising rental rates, acquisitions, and development projects. Realty Income has an elite balance sheet and low dividend payout ratio, giving it the flexibility to continue expanding its portfolio and increasing its monthly dividend. It's routinely adding new growth platforms, including recently making its first investments in data centers and new European markets. "", ""Camden Property Trust is a residential REIT centered on high-growth markets. It owns 172 properties with over 58,600 apartment homes across 15 major markets, predominantly in the South. The company's focus on markets with above-average employment and population growth rates helps drive strong occupancy and rental growth. That provides the REIT with steadily rising income to support its 4.3%-yielding dividend. "", ""The company's pursuit of growth markets also provides new investment opportunities. Camden is investing over $500 million to build five new communities (including two featuring single-family rental homes) that will add over 1,500 units over the next two years. Meanwhile, it has nine more communities under development. It could invest nearly $1.4 billion to build over 3,350 additional homes. "", ""Camden has an strong balance sheet, giving it the flexibility to grow its portfolio and dividend. In addition to development projects, Camden will acquire operating communities and land to support new developments.

Industrial building vacancies are up and rents are down.', ""Logistics businesses nationally are cutting back amid declines in freight volume. United Parcel Service said it would shed 12,000 jobs worldwide over the next several months after more than a $9-billion drop in revenue last year. A company spokesman said it didn't have a breakdown of where those layoffs would hit, but UPS employs tens of thousands of workers in California."", '“Everything is different,” said Victor Ramirez, a Pomona resident who’s worked in warehousing for about 20 years. Speaking in Spanish, he remembered when times were better — much better.', 'The 59-year-old recalled not only getting full 40-hour workweeks in the past but bonuses during the pandemic. These days, things have slowed so much at his current place of employment, a warehouse that builds pallets, that he has taken on additional work as an Uber driver and canvasser for nonprofits.', '“One job isn’t nearly enough,” Ramirez said.', 'With related business services and real estate also down, the Inland Empire’s overall job growth last year averaged just 1.2%, about half the rate for Southern California and the state as a whole. “We could be the weak link,” said John Husing, the region’s longtime economist based in Redlands.', 'Read more: They earn nearly $200,000. Can they afford to have kids in SoCal?', 'The pandemic-induced surge of consumer purchases, transportation gridlock and prolonged labor negotiations at the ports all played a role in disrupting the flow of goods and exacerbating an oversupply of warehouses. But even before COVID, the industry was feeling increasing strains from environmental regulations, disputes over independent trucking and rising operating costs that have pushed more businesses to leave the state.', 'The Inland Empire’s troubles come as the U.S. economy faces an expected slowdown and the tech sector continues to shed jobs. California’s tourism industry, another big economic engine, hasn’t fully recovered, and high interest rates have taken a bite out of the housing market. All of that has left the state trailing the nation in job growth. The latest unemployment rate statewide, as well as for the Inland Empire, was 5.1% in December, well above the U.S. figure of 3.7%.', '“Right now I am not an optimist on this economy,” Husing said.', 'Thanks to lower housing costs than in Los Angeles and Orange counties, the Inland Empire’s population has been growing for decades. Over the years, many residents found work in a logistics industry that has surged along with the region. Since 2000, the Inland Empire’s population has increased by 45% to 4.7 million last year. And jobs during that period have jumped even faster, up 68% to 1.7 million. That’s about as many as in all of Orange County.', ""A lot of that came on the back of the logistics industry, which got a big boost from soaring trade with China. Today, about 40% of all containers entering the U.S. from Asia are handled by the ports of L.A. and Long Beach. More than 37,000 heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers based in the Inland Empire haul that cargo to rails and some 4,000 warehouses that are scattered across Riverside and San Bernardino counties' 27,000 square miles, double the land area of the next largest metropolitan area, Phoenix-Scottsdale in Arizona."", 'The growing number of jobs brought the promise of greater economic security and quality of life as more residents were able to get jobs closer to home. But the growth of the logistics industry has exacerbated environmental concerns in communities with some of the least-healthful air in the United States. And analysts say too many households in the area are struggling to make ends meet as earnings have not kept up with rising costs.', 'Sheheryar Kaoosji, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Warehouse Worker Resource Center in Ontario, said many logistics jobs are still too close to minimum wage, are temporary or seasonal and are often quick to disappear when the economy softens.', '“The average worker is always in a position of uncertainty,” he said.', 'For all occupations, Inland Empire workers made $27.96 an hour on average in 2022, the latest according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is compared with $33.43 for L.A. and Orange counties combined, and $45.37 for the San Francisco Bay Area.', 'More than 270,000 people in the Inland Empire work in transportation and material moving occupations. Their median hourly pay in 2022: $21.13. Stockers and order fillers made even less — $19.01 an hour, on average.', ""California’s statewide minimum wage for larger employers was $15 an hour in 2022. It went up to $16 this year, and for fast-food workers it'll go to $20 an hour in April."", '""It\'s a good starter job, but as far as long-term, a lot of people think they’re going to do it for life,"" said Byron Williams, 48, of Moreno Valley, referring to logistics jobs at Amazon.', ""Williams once worked at Amazon, though on the finance side of logistics. The e-commerce behemoth operates more than a dozen distribution facilities in the Inland Empire. Williams said he left because of the pay. “It's not a for-life position.”"", 'Going through boom and bust cycles has been part and parcel of life in the Inland Empire. The area tumbled during the early 1990s downturn that was marked by defense cuts and overbuilding. And it was one of the hardest hit by the subprime mortgage crisis that brought the Great Recession in 2007-09.', 'The pandemic, at first, seemed to be an exception. The Inland Empire’s economy quickly rebounded thanks to surging orders for all kinds of stuff from people stuck in their homes. Rounds of government stimulus checks added fuel to consumer spending.', 'But in the last year the industry suddenly fell back, in part as consumer spending shifted more to services, such as travel and entertainment , and less on things such as cars and groceries. High inflation also was a factor, as was the unusual situation at the ports.', 'Early in the pandemic, dozens of ships were lined up at sea waiting to berth in L.A. and Long Beach ports. When the logjam eased, merchandise flooded into the region, prompting wholesalers and distributors to double down on warehouses and workers.', '“We couldn’t hire fast enough,” said Jeff Baldassari, who until August was president of U.S. Rubber Recycling in Colton, which got a burst of pandemic orders of rubber mats for in-home gyms and other uses. “Now the party ended, and it’s the hangover the next day,” he said.', 'Drawn-out labor talks with longshoremen that lasted more than a year prompted some companies to divert cargo to the East and Gulf Coast ports.', 'In the last few months, warehouses and distribution centers have shut down in Rialto, Fontana, Jurupa Valley, Perris and Chino, among other cities, according to WARN Act filings with the state. During the summer, the bankrupt trucking firm Yellow Corp. shuttered several terminals in the Inland Empire that eliminated about 1,000 jobs.', ""The downturn in logistics has spread to other industries too, including finance and real estate. San Francisco-based Prologis, the world's biggest warehouse developer and a major player in the Inland Empire, reported a 7% drop in rents in the fourth quarter for Southern California. The company said its construction pipeline in the region was half of what it was at year-end 2022."", 'During a recent conference call with analysts, Prologis’ chief executive, Hamid Moghadam, said it\'s always been difficult for retailers and wholesalers to correctly forecast demand and manage inventories. “They\'re schizophrenic. They always have too much or too little. You can never get it right.""', ""Read more: REI to close its Santa Monica store, the retailer's second move out of a bustling city center this month"", 'Still, he and other developers said they are bullish on the future. The logistics business in Southern California is getting back on its feet after the pandemic, they said. And key drivers of growth remain intact — e-commerce, global trade, demand for larger, more efficient distribution centers, said Iddo Benzeevi, chief executive of Highland Fairview, a developer working on a massive logistics center in Moreno Valley.', ""But that will also bring more consolidation, he said. Older, smaller facilities will get phased out, and payrolls aren't likely to grow as fast as before. In the long term, logistics jobs may require higher skills and pay better as facilities become more automated and employ technologies such as driverless trucks — but they could employ fewer workers."", ""For truck driver Mauricio Perez, a 15-year veteran at UPS who lives in Rancho Cucamonga, it's the near term that worries him."", 'Work usually slows after the busy Christmas season, but he said this year looks different. During the holidays, Perez saw 53-foot trailers stacked to the brim with items and packages to be delivered. Nowadays, 28-foot trailers have barely two or three pallets inside.', 'What\'s more, he said that the work-bidding process at UPS suggests that a lot more truckers in the Inland Empire are likely to be on a more flexible schedule that can vary week to week or shunted to the package hub, where they\'d work fewer hours. That means drivers who don\'t get assigned work may end up taking a ""layoff week,"" in which they won\'t get paid unless they cash out vacation time or accrue pension benefits.', '""It’s not looking like the economy is going to get any better in the next few months,"" Perez said. ""We just gotta brace ourselves for the worst.”', 'This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.']"

The combination could potentially shake up the payments industry, which is largely dominated by Visa and Mastercard.', 'For customers of the companies, it might eventually mean bigger perks and more merchant acceptance of Discover cards, and potentially lead to more competition in the payments industry. But most of the benefits will be going to the companies themselves, as well as the merchants who accept these cards.', 'Why is the deal important?', 'Some of the biggest issuers of credit cards are banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. But Capital One and Discover are first and foremost credit card companies — like American Express, but with different clientele. They have tens of millions of customers and target their products at Americans who do not travel heavily outside the U.S. and would like to get more value out of their everyday purchases like gas, groceries and domestic travel. In other words, people who typically don’t carry premium credit cards.', 'The combined company will have more loans to customers on its credit cards than JPMorgan and Citigroup combined. The merger also gives the Discover network the ability to fight on more equal footing with Mastercard and American Express in a way that it simply hasn’t been able to in its 40-year history.', '“You want the customer or merchant to choose you as a company, either for your products or for your brand, and this deal gives them plenty of opportunity to make that case,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, a payments industry analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.', 'Who uses Capital One and Discover?', 'Capital One is one of the biggest credit card companies and banks in the country. It typically operates what is known in the credit card industry as a “barbell” business model — it issues credit cards to those with less-than-great credit as well as with super high credit, and little in between. The one group keeps a balance, bringing the company interest revenue, while the high-end customers spend heavily on their cards, bringing in fee revenue from merchants.', 'Discover’s customers are fewer but intensely loyal to the company. The company consistently wins customer service awards, and its cash-back cards are considered among the most lucrative in the industry.', 'But Discover suffers from a perception that because its payment network is smaller than Visa, Mastercard or AmEx, it is less desirable. Also, Discover is largely unavailable outside the U.S. as a payment option.', 'Capital One executives said Tuesday that they would start allowing customers to use the Discover payment network shortly after the deal closes, which could happen by the end of the year. Capital One also plans to keep the Discover brand along with its cards, although the cards could be co-branded.', 'What does this deal say about credit card spending?', 'This deal, at its core, is a big bet that Americans will keep running up their credit card balances.', 'Americans have been increasing their card balances quickly amid two years of high inflation. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Americans held $1.13 trillion on their credit cards, and aggregate household debt balances increased by $212 billion, up 1.2%, according to the latest data from the New York Federal Reserve.', 'Consumers are also paying higher interest rates on those balances. The average interest rate on a bank credit card is roughly 21.5%, the highest it’s been since the Federal Reserve started tracking the data in 1994.', 'Critics of Capital One have long said the company relies heavily on those who can least afford to be carrying high interest balances on their credit cards. Historically Capital One has had higher default rates and higher 30-day delinquency rates than JPMorgan, Citi, Discover and American Express.', 'What’s so valuable about Discover?', 'It’s virtually impossible to build a credit and debit card network from scratch in today’s market. Capital One executives described previous efforts to do so as a “chicken or egg” problem, where it’s hard to get merchants to sign up for a payment network when there are few customers, and vice versa.', 'Chicago-based Discover may be small but its infrastructure makes it poised to grow, particularly as more transactions move away from cash. The U.S. credit card industry is dominated by the Visa-Mastercard duopoly with AmEx being a distance third place and Discover an even more distant fourth place. Roughly $6.8 trillion is run on Visa’s credit and debit network compared to the only $550 billion on Discover’s network.', 'Owning Discover’s network would enable Capital One to get revenue from fees charged for every merchant transaction that runs on the network.', 'It also turns Capital One into the rare credit card company that controls the cards, the payment network and the bank that issues the card. There’s only one other company that has accomplished this to scale: American Express.', 'Will regulators approve the deal?', 'It’s unclear whether the deal will pass regulatory scrutiny. Nearly every bank issues a credit card to customers but few companies are credit card companies first, and banks second. Both Discover — which was long ago the Sears Card — and Capital One started off as credit card companies that expanded into other financial offerings like checking and savings accounts.', 'Bank regulators have signaled for some time that they want to give more scrutiny to large mergers in the financial services sector.

Left-leaning politicians like Sen. Sherrod Brown, the powerful Democratic chair of the Senate Banking Committee, are already calling for close scrutiny of the deal.', '“The deal also poses massive anti-trust concerns, given the vertical integration of Capital One’s credit card lending with Discover’s credit card network,” said Jesse Van Tol, president and CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.']"

The company reported a robust revenue of approximately $4.1 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting its strong financial standing and market reach.

Pentair's brand names, such as Everpure, Fleck, and Sta-Rite, are synonymous with reliability and performance, which has helped the company secure a loyal customer base. The acquisition of Manitowoc Ice in July 2022 for $1.6 billion further demonstrates Pentair's strategic growth initiatives and its dedication to expanding its water solutions offerings."", ""Financial Robustness: Pentair's financial performance is a cornerstone of its strength. With a revenue of $4.1 billion in 2023, the company showcases a solid balance sheet.

This financial robustness provides Pentair with the capital necessary to invest in research and development, enabling continuous improvement of its product lines and maintaining its competitive edge in the market."", ""Supply Chain and Raw Material Vulnerabilities: Despite its strong market position, Pentair faces challenges in its supply chain, particularly in the procurement of raw materials like steel, electronic components, and plastics. Global container transportation delays and volatile market trends have the potential to affect raw material availability and lead times. This vulnerability could impact Pentair's ability to meet customer demand promptly and maintain its reputation for quality and service."", ""Labor Force Management: Pentair's success is heavily reliant on its ability to attract, develop, and retain a skilled workforce. While the company has a relatively small portion of unionized employees in the U.S., it must navigate complex labor relations, particularly in Europe where employee representative organizations are more prevalent. The need to offer competitive wages and benefits to retain top talent adds to the operational costs and could affect Pentair's profitability if not managed effectively."", ""Emerging Market Expansion: Pentair is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for water treatment solutions in emerging markets. With its strong brand presence and innovative product range, the company can leverage its expertise to tap into new geographical regions, where the need for clean and sustainable water solutions is rapidly increasing. This expansion could lead to significant revenue growth and diversification of Pentair's customer base."", ""Sustainability Trend Alignment: The global shift towards sustainability presents a substantial opportunity for Pentair. The company's focus on energy-efficient and eco-friendly products aligns with the increasing consumer and regulatory demand for sustainable solutions. By continuing to innovate in this area, Pentair can strengthen its market leadership and attract environmentally conscious customers, further driving sales and brand loyalty."", ""Economic Fluctuations: Pentair's international operations expose it to risks associated with global economic conditions. Currency exchange rate volatility, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, could adversely affect the company's financial results. Additionally, economic downturns in key markets could lead to reduced demand for Pentair's products, impacting its revenue and growth prospects."", ""Intense Competition: The water treatment industry is highly competitive, with numerous domestic and international players vying for market share. Some competitors have substantially greater resources, which could challenge Pentair's ability to maintain its competitive position. The company must continuously innovate and offer high-quality, competitively priced products to stay ahead of its rivals and protect its market share."", 'In conclusion, Pentair PLC (NYSE:PNR) exhibits a robust set of strengths, including a strong brand reputation, innovative product offerings, and solid financial performance. However, it must address weaknesses related to supply chain vulnerabilities and labor force management to sustain its competitive edge. Opportunities for growth in emerging markets and the sustainability trend present promising avenues for expansion, while economic fluctuations and intense competition pose significant threats.

His trajectory, evolving from an individual contributor to a team leader and manager, mirrors a commitment to personal growth and fostering the career aspirations of others, a deeply rewarding facet of his tenure.', ""Francis's nomination for Leader of the Year at the 2023 DE&I Impact Awards reflects his substantial contributions to Mondelēz International's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives. Serving on the R&D DE&I Committee, he actively shapes an agenda aligned with diversity ambitions."", 'Could you share about your journey at Mondelēz International and how you arrived at your current role in R&D?', ""I've worked with the company for 15 years now, predominantly within the confections category (Stride, Trident, SPK, SF etc.) in R&D. As I advanced from an individual contributor to a team leader, and eventually to a manager, I have had the opportunity to grow personally, help deliver our business objectives as well as help others achieve their career aspirations. This has been the most rewarding part of the journey."", ""Currently, I'm the R&D Director for NA Central Productivity. It highlighted the importance of the ingredients that we source, but also the impact of designing with flexible ingredients to help unlock drive bottom- and top-line growth. I was intrigued with my current role because of the opportunity to learn about our end-to-end business from a cross category perspective. It's an honor and a privilege to lead my department in this regard while learning about how research and development can help build flexibility to achieve our business goals."", ""Your nomination for Leader of the Year at the DE&I Impact Awards was very well deserved. How has your role in the R&D DE&I Committee allowed you to influence and contribute to Mondelēz International's DE&I initiatives, particularly within the R&D space?"", ""The DEI is a very rewarding initiative to be a part of, but also a challenging space to navigate. I've learned something new every year as a member of the R&D DEI committee. The DEI Committee role has given me a platform to create, with others, an agenda that's fitting of our diversity ambition. Essentially, how we continue to build Diversity and Inclusion internally, in areas where there's underrepresentation. With this platform my team and I've been able to advocate for recruitment, speak to retention strategies and build external partnerships with new Universities. This has been accomplished by pulling the right people together to address the topic of Diversity in R&D."", 'DE&I has become increasingly important in corporate settings. How do you envision the role of DE&I within R&D, and how has your leadership impacted this space?', ""The role of DE&I within R&D isn't different from any of the other Mondelēz International departments perse. We need to strive for representation and diversity in thought leadership to crack innovation, bring in creativity and novel problem-solving techniques. Our starting points across the various departments may be different but the end goal is the same. My strength as an active listener and as an inclusive leadership has helped me lead/navigate this space. This has resulted working with a sub team that explores opportunities to build technical partnerships/ support with the Universities but also review opportunities to develop underrepresented populations within R&D. It is a long journey and it's not one that can be accomplished in a short term. To be successful we'll need consistency, persistence and a diversity in thought leadership."", 'Could you share any notable successes or milestones achieved through your leadership in promoting DE&I within the R&D team at Mondelēz International?', ""The first key milestone for me was assembling a small R&D team that was truly passionate about enhancing our internship program. Their support helped us build a relationship with a top HBCU school, North Carolina A&T. Our first engagement was in 2021 and each year we've learned and modified our approach to connect with the students and faculty from the Food Science Department but also our university relations team. This has resulted in attracting students to participate in our internship program- 6% within the 2021 intern class to 20% for the ‘23 internship campaign. The most rewarding bit has been 1) seeing the DEI team members recognized as nominees within the R&D awards and 2) seeing the interns from NCA&T personally engaged and promoting our internship to their peers."", ""In what ways do you encourage a diverse and inclusive environment within your team? Are there specific strategies or practices you've found particularly effective?"", ""My team and I make it a point to spend time to discuss DE&I topics during our staff meetings. We often take turns to bring topics to our huddles. We've reflected on the topic on the table and have open dialogues. This leads to insightful discussions on about our personal stories and journey. There have been differences in our journeys as one can imagine, but most importantly the time spent contributes to building an inclusive and collaborative team."", 'As a black leader in the corporate world, what advice would you give to aspiring individuals from underrepresented backgrounds who aim for leadership roles within the STEM or R&D fields?', ""Be yourself. Leadership starts with knowing yourself and then leading others so the first and most important thing, is to know yourself- what drives you, what motivates you etc. After that comes confidence- having the confidence that your capable of learning, adapting, and developing your capabilities. From there, it's about helping others realize their full potential while working towards a common goal/ objective. Regarding a STEM/ R&D Fields, the great thing about research and development is that there's more than one way to solve a problem. To develop within the STEM fields, I would encourage individuals to be relentlessly curious. Clearly define the problem and then be open to finding creative ways to put the building blocks together to solve the problem."", 'How does Mondelez International support and foster an environment where diversity, equity, and inclusion are not only acknowledged but actively promoted across all departments, including R&D?', ""I think Mondelēz is on its way to help foster and support an environment of diversity equity inclusion. We are an international company so that comes naturally when you look at MDLZ on a global scale. The most challenging part for me is within our microenvironments, inside our regions and BU how do we ensure to continue advocating for diverse teams. I've seen refinement in our approach to attract talent and space to have an open dialogue to ensure we create a culture that attracts and retains top talent when they arrive in R&D. We must continue to move with purpose but also acknowledge that we'll need to be patient to help enable a change. Overall, I've seen how both internally and externally campaigns make it a point to celebrate diversity. We'll need to continue to do more of that."", 'Looking ahead, what are your aspirations or goals for further advancing DE&I initiatives within R&D?', 'My aspirations and goals for advancing DEI initiatives within R&D would be to create an ongoing commitment to have a rotating sub-team that continuously develop and supports underrepresented groups. As we evolve within the space of DEI in R&D, I would love to see more external, community engagement in the form of partnership with educational institutions to develop upcoming, talented scientists.

Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.5%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', ""Even a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. However, prior to this announcement, Occidental Petroleum's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 37.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 11%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.56 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.88. This works out to a decline of approximately 66% over that time. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for."", ""Dividends have been going in the wrong direction, so we definitely want to see a different trend in the earnings per share. Over the past five years, it looks as though Occidental Petroleum's EPS has declined at around 4.6% a year. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend."", ""Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

Oxy outbid Chevron (NYSE: CVX) in 2019 to acquire Anadarko Petroleum, a move that initially backfired on it when oil and gas prices crashed in 2020. It took years for Oxy to restore order to its balance sheet. But it didn't take long for it to go for another big play: In December, it announced its plan to acquire privately held CrownRock for $12 billion."", ""Here's what you need to know about Oxy's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results, its balance sheet, its recent 22% dividend increase, and whether the dividend stock is worth buying now."", ""What got Oxy in trouble in 2020 was that it had levered up its balance sheet and boosted production so that it could make a ton of cash if oil prices were high. This strategy left the company particularly vulnerable to low oil prices. Its strategy is pretty much the same today -- it's just that oil prices are higher now than they were then. Oxy can do quite well in the current price environment, with prices for West Texas Intermediate crude in the $70 per barrel to $80 per barrel range. Case in point, it booked $1 billion in profits in the fourth quarter."", ""In 2023, Oxy booked $3.77 billion in net income, or $3.90 in earnings per share (EPS). It produced 1.22 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), an increase of 5.4% compared to 2022. That higher production helped drive profits. It reported an average worldwide oil price of $76.85 per barrel in 2023 compared to $94.36 in 2022. This price difference had a big impact on Oxy's performance. Profits were $12.5 billion in 2022 for EPS of $12.40 -- more than triple its 2023 profits."", ""For comparison, consider that ExxonMobil's (NYSE: XOM) profits were 57% higher in 2022 than in 2023, Chevron's were 68% higher, and peer E&P company ConocoPhillips' (NYSE: COP) were 70% higher. Compared to other companies, Oxy's strategy is much more dependent on higher oil prices. But when prices are high, it cashes in. Just one big year can go a long way. Its 2022 performance transformed the business, allowing it to pay down debt and get its balance sheet in a position to pursue the CrownRock acquisition."", ""In the fourth-quarter presentation, management said Oxy had regained and reaffirmed an investment-grade credit rating. But the balance sheet isn't remotely close to being as healthy as oil majors like Chevron or ExxonMobil, or even many of its E&P peers."", ""Oxy paid $945 million in interest expenses in 2023. It finished the year with net long-term debt of $18.54 billion, a major improvement from $25.87 billion in Q1 2022. But still, that's a lot of debt for a company of its size. For comparison, ConocoPhillips has $12.3 billion in net long-term debt, ExxonMobil has $10 billion, and Chevron has more cash on the books than long-term debt."", ""ExxonMobil's acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron's acquisition of Hess -- both pending -- will be all-stock transactions. Oxy's deal purchase of CrownRock will be funded with debt. If oil prices stay high, then Oxy wins big. But in the meantime, it will once again lever up its balance sheet."", ""Specifically, it is financing the CrownRock purchase by incurring $9.1 billion in net debt and the assumption of $1.2 billion of CrownRock's existing debt. That total is more debt than it paid off between Q1 2022 and the end of 2023. In exchange, Oxy will gain 170,000 boe/d in low-breakeven price Permian production.

The company repurchases stock and pays dividends, but not nearly at the rates of many of its peers. It's also doubtful it will buy back a meaningful amount of stock again until it has integrated CrownRock."", 'Management recently raised the quarterly dividend by 22% to $0.22 a share, giving the stock a forward yield of 1.5%. Before the 2020 crash, Oxy paid $0.79 a quarter, but cut its dividend to $0.01 a quarter in 2020. It has since been building it back up. But it has demonstrated that those payouts are unreliable.', 'Unlike ExxonMobil and Chevron, which can lean on their strong balance sheets to support their dividends, Oxy is already levered up, so it has to either maintain a smaller payout or cut its dividends when oil and natural gas prices fall. And its dividend outlook has become even more uncertain since the announcement of the CrownRock deal.', ""What I love about Oxy is that it's a straightforward company. It's ultra-bullish on strong oil and natural gas prices, and it handles its spending, balance sheet, and mergers and acquisitions strategy accordingly. I expect Oxy to go full steam ahead when the energy market is good and get clobbered during downturns."", 'If I were building an oil and natural gas portfolio from scratch, I would center it around ExxonMobil and Chevron because they both have impeccable balance sheets, strong dividends that they have hiked every year for decades, diversified businesses, and downside protection in case energy prices fall. However, I would consider including Oxy as a role player in that portfolio because it has so much upside potential.', ""It's hard to know for sure, but I'd guess that's how Buffett and his team view Oxy as well. The vast majority of Berkshire's energy exposure is in relatively safe oil and gas and utility assets through Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE) and Chevron. Berkshire owns about $15 billion worth of Oxy shares -- or 28.3% of the company -- but it's only a fraction of the value of BHE, and is also less than Berkshire's $19 billion Chevron position."", ""If you don't care too much about reliable dividends and want a high-risk/high-potential reward bet on U.S. oil and natural gas production, Oxy could be worth it.

Reports emerged on Feb. 20 that Occidental is considering a sale of its interests in Western Midstream Partners, an infrastructure company valued at roughly $20 billion, according to Reuters.', '“By virtue of all the M&A that’s happening, there’s a lot of appetite for companies to try to get into the Permian and we do have properties in the Permian that are not core to us but could be core to others and some of it just where they’re placed in the Permian geographically,” Vicki Hollub, Occidental’s president and CEO, said during the company’s Feb. 15 quarterly earnings webcast.', 'The cash and stock acquisition of CrownRock, announced in December, is anticipated to close in first-quarter 2024.', '“The divestitures, I believe, will go well,” Hollub said. “What we won’t do, though, is we’ve decided not to make any divestitures until we close the CrownRock acquisition and then we’ll start a proactive process more aggressively at that point.”', 'But reports that Occidental is exploring the sale of its share of Western Midstream Partners — the company owns a 49% stake — could generate substantial proceeds to reduce debt. Occidental ended 2023 with long-term debt of $18.5 billion. That doesn’t include the $1.2 billion CrownRock debt Occidental will assume when the deal closes. Occidental is leaning on $9.1 billion in new debt and $1.7 billion in common equity to finance the deal.', 'RELATED', 'Which Occidental Assets Will Hit Chopping Block After $12B CrownRock Deal?', 'In terms of material deals to come after Occidental closes the CrownRock deal, Hollub ruled that out last week.', '“Anything that’s material, we wouldn’t likely do,” Hollub said. “We’re trying to minimize the cash flows sold to ensure that we can maintain our cash flow. With that said, there will be some cash flow going, because it’s hard to sell any assets out here that we haven’t already at least done appraisal work on to generate some cash flow.”', 'Hollub classified the CrownRock acquisition as strategic since it added “high-margin, low-break-even inventory,” she said during the webcast as part of her prepared remarks. Hollub said incremental cash flow would be used to support Occidental’s plan to deliver a sustainable and growing dividend with deleveraging and share repurchases after reducing the company’s debt to $15 billion.', 'Occidental aims to repay $4.5 billion in debt within 12 months of transaction close and eyes $4.5 billion to $6 billion of after-tax divestiture proceeds to be realized within 18 months of transaction close, Occidental said when it announced the CrownRock acquisition.', 'TD Cowen’s investment thesis on Occidental sees the producer benefitting from multi-year de-leveraging efforts. An attractive asset base is expected to “deliver outsized returns of capital to shareholders in the coming years, supported by a superior asset base in the Permian, DJ [Denver-Julesburg Basin], GOM and international, in addition to value enhancing opportunities via Occidental Low Carbon Ventures,” analysts wrote in a Feb. 15 report.', 'Hollub said Occidental was working constructively with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is reviewing the CrownRock deal. Occidental CFO Sunil Mathew said additional requests from the FTC would impact the timing of the closing. However, he said Occidental still expects to receive regulatory approval and close the acquisition later this year.', '“While total shareholder returns are likely to decline nearer-term to focus on debt repayment, we forecast the payout by 2026 (or sooner) should be better than ever,” Truist Securities wrote in a Feb. 15 research report.', 'Occidental aims to use its excess cash flow to reduce long-term debt as it looks to rebalance its enterprise value to the liking of common shareholders, according to recent financial details revealed by company executives.', 'Occidental’s debt reduction will target lowering expenses and improving the balance sheet.', '“Once we get our debt back down to $15 billion, that’s going to be a key part of helping us then to start the resumption of a more robust share purchase program of both the common and ultimately the preferred,” Hollub said.', '“We’re going to accumulate cash flow as we continue to work toward closing the CrownRock deal, because a part of cash flow will be used to help pay down both the term loan and our debt maturities that are coming. So, cash flow would not be used for share repurchases until we get to the point where we’ve achieved those goals,” Hollub said.', 'Occidental remains focused on its sustainable and growing dividend, while its share repurchase plan supports capital appreciation and per-share dividend growth, executives said.', '“Post CrownRock the Occidental game theory has become harder. We had been convinced the cycle of free cash flow generation plus preferential pay down would leave shareholders disadvantaged over a longer period,” Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a Feb. 15 research report.', '“With the changes to preferential redemption, now clearly pushed to end of decade (incremental debt from CrownRock the first priority) one is left with a relatively disadvantaged shareholder return vehicle and a long road to de-leveraging with an albeit better than most asset position in the global upstream,” Evercore said.', 'CrownRock adds to Occidental’s inventory in the core of the Midland Basin with a rich and understood subsurface, according to Occidental. The company also plans to expand unconventional EOR opportunities to follow on its Midland pilot success.', 'Over the next five years to 10 years, EOR will be a significant part of Occidental’s portfolio development. Hollub said Occidental had 2 Bbbl of resources remaining to be developed and that its Direct Air Capture (DAC) facilities, which will remove CO2 from the atmosphere, would result in “the most sustainable barrels in the world.”', '“We have high-quality, short-cycle, high-return oil and gas shale development in the U.S., along with conventional, lower-decline oil and gas development in Permian EOR, GoM, Oman, Algeria and Abu Dhabi,” Hollub said in her opening remarks. “These developments are complemented by our strong and stable cash flow from our chemicals business and the cash flow and carbon reduction we expect our low-carbon ventures to provide in the future.”', 'In 2024, Occidental is eyeing capex between $5.8 billion and $6 billion. The bulk of the spending — between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion — will flow into the Permian Basin, where Occidental will run 10 net rigs. Capex for low-carbon ventures is expected to be $0.6 billion.', 'For the year, Occidental expects oil and gas production of between 1.2 MMboe/d and 1.3 MMboe/d, dominated by the Permian (expected to account for 47% of total production), the Rockies (24%), Gulf of Mexico (11%) and international (18%). That compares to average production of 1.2 MMboe/d in 2023.']"

Also, critics say, larger financial institutions tend to have inferior customer service. Discover, which has focused on prime customers with better credit ratings, has a reputation for superior customer service.', 'The National Community Reinvestment Coalition immediately came out against the deal, noting that a report last week by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that small banks and credit unions offered credit cards with significantly lower interest rates than large banks in the first half of 2023.', '""This deal is not likely to create public benefits that outweigh its adverse effects.

Sherrod Brown, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, who vowed to closely monitor the deal so it ""doesn’t enrich shareholders and executives at the expense of consumers and small businesses.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts came out in opposition.', ""The merger is structured as an all-stock deal, with Discover shareholders receiving 1.0192 Capital One shares for each of their Discover shares.

John Kasich; Barber; Samet Fahmy, a former top executive at Kansas City Southern; William Clyburn Jr., a former vice chairman at the Surface Transportation Board; and Alison Landry, a longtime transportation analyst.', 'Ancora also has an equity stake in freight broker C.H.

Since the Board announced its appointment of Alan Shaw as Chief Executive Officer, Norfolk Southern’s status as the worst Class I railroad has been solidified by leadership delivering industry-worst operating results, sustained share price underperformance and a tone-deaf response to the devastating East Palestine, Ohio derailment. The future looks equally bleak under Mr. Shaw, who has drawn the condemnation of policymakers and the skepticism of underwhelmed analysts and shareholders.', 'In recent months, we engaged in good faith and shared a data-centric, facts-based case for meaningful change with Norfolk Southern’s Board. We privately conveyed, on several occasions, that Mr. Shaw’s strategy is equal parts unambitious and impractical (despite somehow having the unanimous backing of the Board). Moreover, we privately showed that Mr. Shaw’s background as a 30-year insider with a poor record of driving growth through marketing roles renders him unfit to get a second chance as Chief Executive Officer. We even met with Mr. Shaw in hopes of having him change our view. While all this was going on, however, Norfolk Southern was sending its private jet to Washington, D.C. so executives could pursue the support of regulators and the Company started requesting public support from customers as part of its planned fight against us.', 'The bottom line is that it is time to actually move Norfolk Southern forward. Moving ahead starts with identifying the right destination. Our slate and proposed management team believe they have the experience and strategy required to turn Norfolk Southern into a safer, more sustainable railroad that is growing profitably while also yielding more stability for customers and employees. As shown in our presentation, this is a far cry from where Norfolk Southern stands today under Mr. Shaw and his loyal backers in the boardroom. In the coming weeks, we look forward to sharing a second presentation that focuses on our 100-day transition plan and the details of our reliable network strategy that will leverage Norfolk Southern’s existing assets and people to get the organization to the right destination.

But as investments, all three companies are Dividend Kings that have paid and raised their payouts for at least 60 years -- making them some of the longest-tenured members of the group.', ""However, all three stocks have also lost value over the last year, while the S&P 500 is up 22.7%. A single-digit dividend yield isn't going to be that appealing if a stock is underperforming by that many percentage points. Yet there are reasons to be optimistic about each company."", ""Here's why all three dividend stocks look like a good value for 2024 and beyond."", ""Lee Samaha (3M): The industrial giant's stock will divide investors. However, one thing that can't be denied is the attractiveness of its current 6.5% dividend yield. While the sustainability of the dividend payout is subject to question due to its need to meet multibillion-dollar cash calls as part of legal settlements, it's worth noting that 3M is still a company generating large amounts of cash."", ""In fact, it's $6.3 billion in free cash flow generation in 2023 is one of the reasons why an analyst at heavyweight Wall Street company JPMorgan raised the price target on the stock recently. Meanwhile, management's restructuring plan will take $700 million to $900 million out of costs by the end of 2025."", ""These kinds of figures make 3M attractive for income-seeking and value investors. Suppose management's restructuring plan works and margin expansion follows alongside a cyclical return to growth in its key end markets, which include automotive, consumer electronics, and consumer products. In that case, 3M's stock price will prove to be undervalued right now."", 'For that to happen, management might need to make some changes to its business model or extend its restructuring actions beyond 2024.', 'Still, as long as 3M can continue to generate substantial cash flow, it should be able to muddle through a difficult period of restructuring, weak end markets, and cash calls from legal settlements. That will give management the time and opportunity to enact the changes necessary to get the company back on track.', ""Scott Levine (American States Water): Attaining Dividend King status is no simple feat. Going to the head of the class and achieving the royal rank of the longest-tenured Dividend King, as American States Water has done, is an accomplishment well worth substantial recognition. For 69 consecutive years, this water utility stock has raised its distribution, and its reliable business model suggests that the tide of dividends it has returned to investors won't ebb anytime soon. For income investors seeking the reliability of a Dividend King, American States Water and its 2.2% forward-yielding dividend deserve considerable attention."", 'While American States Water has increased its dividend for 69 straight years, it has, in fact, paid dividends every year going back to 1931. How has it accomplished such a regal feat? The company operates primarily as a regulated water utility. As such, it provides water and wastewater services to more than 264,000 customers located throughout California. It may not be the most thrilling of businesses, but what it lacks in excitement, it makes up for in its steady nature. Because its bread-and-butter business (it also operates a small electric utility subsidiary) is regulated water utility services, the company is guaranteed certain rates of return. Thus, management has clear foresight into future cash flow, allowing it to plan accordingly for capital expenditures, such as improvements to its infrastructure as well as dividends.', ""American States Water's dividend might now have the allure of high-yield dividend stocks, but cautious investors will find the stock especially appealing. The company's 69-year history of raising its dividend doesn't guarantee that another 69 years of similar raises are coming down the pike. Still, it's certainly a good indication that rewarding shareholders is ingrained in the company's culture. Moreover, the company's conservative payout ratio, averaging 57% over the past five years, suggests that management isn't willing to jeopardize the company's financial well-being for the sake of placating shareholders."", 'Daniel Foelber (Coca-Cola): Investors gravitate to Dividend Kings for their consistency. And while there have been better-performing stocks than Coca-Cola, the beverage giant is the perfect Dividend King when looking strictly at the dividend.', 'Around the same time every year, investors have been able to count on Coke to announce a dividend raise. Coke has gotten so precise that it has announced a dividend raise sometime between Feb. 15 and Feb. 20 every year for the last five years. The recent announcement came on Feb. 15 when Coke declared its 62nd consecutive annual dividend increase, this time bumping the payout by 5.4% from $1.84 per year to $1.94 per share -- good for a forward yield of 3.3%.', ""The size of Coke's dividend raise tells you a lot about how the business is doing. For example, raises were fairly large in the mid-2010s. But there was a stretch in the late 2010s and early 2020s when Coke implemented a mere one cent per share per quarter raises."", ""Using the size of dividend raises as a litmus test for the strength of the business doesn't work for all companies, but it has been a useful gauge for Coke. The company takes its dividend very seriously and is only going to make a substantial raise if it thinks it can afford it and build on top of it in the future."", ""After all, Coke pays the third-highest dividends out of any consumer staples company. It paid $7.95 billion in dividends over the last 12 months, behind only Philip Morris at $7.96 billion and Procter & Gamble at $9.09 billion. It's a lot to ask a company to fund an after-tax bill that high year in and year out, let alone make that bill increasingly higher. And yet, that is what Coke investors have to expect and will continue to expect."", ""The best Dividend Kings are able to grow their earnings at least as much as their dividends. That way, dividends don't deplete cash reserves on the balance sheet or lead a company to take on debt. The last year was one of the best Coke has had in a while."", ""Sales and earnings growth are back. Operating margins are strong, clocking in at a whopping 28.3%. That's an incredibly high margin for a company that sells a physical product. Coke's margins are a key reason why it can afford its dividend. Off $45.75 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, it has earned $10.7 billion in net income, more than enough to afford the $7.95 billion it paid in dividends."", ""Coke's business and dividend look solid, and the price-to-earnings ratio is 24 -- not bad for such a high-quality business.

But the danger for investors is assuming that just because a company has increased its dividend for decades, it will continue to do so, or that it will always be a great dividend stock.', 'Walgreens Boots Alliance is a prime example. The pharmacy retailer slashed its payouts this year, breaking a dividend growth streak that was closing in on five decades.', 'Rather than focusing on the past, investors should carefully consider which stocks are safe buys for the future, and whose payouts could rise in the years to come. While there are never any guarantees when it comes to dividends, three stocks I expect should increase their payouts for years and be able to pay you for the rest of your life are Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).', 'Coca-Cola has a hugely successful business that it has been able to expand and transform over time. As consumers have become more health conscious, the company came out with healthier product choices. In 2023, for example, sales of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar grew at a rate of 5% -- higher than trademark Coca-Cola sales, which were up by just 2%.', ""While investors may be most familiar with the company's Coca-Cola line of products, the business is far broader, with hundreds of brands in its portfolio, including Powerade, Fanta, Minute Maid, and Dasani. Coca-Cola's strong diversification makes it likely that the business will continue growing steadily over the years to come. And as consumer tastes evolve, so too will the business."", ""Last year, the company's earnings per share rose by 13% to $2.47, which is well above the rate of its annualized dividend of $1.94. This month, Coca-Cola announced it was increasing its dividend for the 62nd consecutive year. And given the company's impressive results, there's little reason to doubt that streak will continue for the foreseeable future."", ""Costco doesn't have a long dividend streak like Coca-Cola, but Costco has been raising its payouts since 2005. And occasionally, the shopping club giant has also rewarded its shareholders with special dividend payments. The company's approach to dividends is why I'm confident this can be a reliable dividend stock to own forever."", ""In its most recent quarter, which ended on Nov. 26, 2023, Costco reported $56.7 billion in net sales, which was up 6.1% from the prior-year period. During the 12-week period, the company generated 11.2% comparable revenue growth in international markets and 6.3% revenue growth in e-commerce. Those are two areas of its business I expect will drive growth in the future, as there's still plenty of room for Costco to grow internationally (750 of its 874 warehouses are in North America) and for it to develop a greater presence online."", 'The stock still has a fairly modest payout ratio of just 27%, leaving plenty of room for Costco to continue growing its dividend. Although its yield of 0.6% may look underwhelming, this could be a key dividend stock for investors to hold for the long haul.', ""Another low-yielding stock (0.5%) on this list is Apple. And like Costco, it's one that investors should expect to increase for decades. The tech company has only been increasing its payouts since 2013 but because of the iPhone maker's incredibly large profits and significant free cash flow, it's highly probable that Apple will pump more money into its dividend in the future."", 'At 15% of earnings, its payout ratio is the lowest on this list. The company reported a profit of $33.9 billion during the last three months of 2023, rising by 13% even amid challenging economic conditions. And its operating cash flow during that period totaled $39.9 billion. While the company is investing in growth opportunities, and a chatbot may even be on the horizon, Apple used up just $2.4 billion on capital spending during the period.', ""Apple's strong financials make it highly probable that the company will continue raising its dividend in the future.

These two dividend stock favorites showed off why investors gravitate toward their stellar businesses. Each grew sales through a tough selling environment while demonstrating pricing power on the way to higher profit margins.', 'Their trajectories are different, though, and so are the premiums that investors are being asked to pay for these two businesses.', ""With that in mind, let's look at which stock is the better buy right now."", ""Coke easily wins the growth matchup. The beverage titan reported a 12% organic sales boost for 2023 while Pepsi's growth was less than 10%. Coke benefited from the fact that a high proportion of its sales are in the on-the-go niche -- places like restaurants and sporting events -- which shoppers are prioritizing in the wake of the pandemic."", 'Pepsi still managed to increase sales on top of big gains a year ago. However, its growth came entirely from rising prices. Volumes were down 2% in the food division and slipped 1% in the beverage segment. In contrast, Coke demonstrated more pricing power, with prices and volumes rising throughout 2023.', 'Pepsi did a good job improving its profit margin in 2023 thanks to a combination of rising prices and cost cuts. Core earnings jumped 14% for the year compared to its 9.5% organic sales increase.', ""Yet Coke is the stronger business in this area, too. The beverage giant has some financial advantages that Pepsi lacks, including its focus on profitable drink sales, its massive global sales footprint, and its highly efficient selling infrastructure. These factors help explain why Coke's profit margin is sitting at 30% of sales, or roughly double PepsiCo's result."", ""You'll get plenty of cash returns from holding Coke in your portfolio as well. The company paid $8 billion in dividends last year and spent nearly $2 billion on stock buybacks. That's another way that shareholders can enjoy strong overall returns by holding the leading beverage giant."", ""Pepsi is the cheaper stock, but investors might still prefer paying the premium for Coke over its less expensive rival. Sure, you can own Pepsi for 2.5 times sales, or less than half of Coke's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5.6. You'll get roughly the same 3% dividend yield in either case."", ""Coke stock doesn't just deliver the operating and financial wins outlined above, though. Its outlook also reflects stronger growth potential in 2024 and beyond. Specifically, Coke executives said in early February that organic sales will rise between 6% and 7% this year thanks to solid demand for its core beverages and for relatively new additions to the portfolio, such as sparkling waters and energy drinks."", 'Pepsi, on the other hand, sees sales climbing by just 4% this year thanks to weak demand. ""Category growth rates are normalizing as consumer behaviors largely revert to pre-pandemic norms,"" CEO Ramon LaGuarta told investors recently.', ""Both companies are being impacted by these pressures, although Pepsi is taking a bigger hit. Given their similar dividend yields, along with Coke's stronger cash flow and earnings power, the industry leader seems like the better buy now. That's true even if you'll have to pay a modest premium to own this high-performing consumer staples business."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

The beverage titan recently closed out its fiscal 2023 year and told its shareholders what they can expect for 2024. The update contained some yellow flags worth watching over the next few quarters but was mainly packed with good news on growth and profitability. Let's dive right in."", ""Coke reported a 12% organic sales increase for Q4 and for the full 2023 year. That's a much better result than investors saw from peer PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). The beverage and snack foods giant posted 10% higher sales for the year across its portfolio, alongside a 7% boost in the beverage division."", ""Looking behind that headline figure reveals even more strength from the Coke family of brands. Volume rose 2% even as prices increased at a nearly 10% rate. Pepsi couldn't manage the same level of pricing power; its volume declined 5% this past year. It's great news for future growth that Coke could achieve a balance between price and sales volume gains."", 'This momentum feeds right into Coke\'s brighter outlook for the year ahead. Pepsi warned investors in early February to expect slower growth over the coming quarters due to weaker category demand and decelerating inflation. Coke, on the other hand, sees room for optimism. ""We\'re confident that our all-weather strategy ... will continue to create value for our stakeholders in 2024 and for the long term,"" CEO James Quincey said in a press release.', ""Management put some hard numbers behind those positive comments. Coke is projecting organic sales growth of between 6% and 7% (compared to Pepsi's 4%) for 2024. The company is also expecting earnings gains to outpace revenue growth, likely keeping Coke's profit margin close to its current impressive rate of nearly 30% of sales."", ""As you might expect, investors are being asked to pay a premium for all this financial and operating strength. Coke was one of the worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year, but the shares still sport a high valuation. You'll pay 5.7 times sales for the industry leader compared to PepsiCo's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.5. The valuation gap isn't as pronounced with respect to earnings, but Coke is still the more expensive stock of the two."", ""Even so, investors might consider paying the premium. Coke's profit margin is double that of PepsiCo, the company is growing more quickly, and it has a brighter outlook ahead for organic sales trends. Toss in its 3% dividend yield, which provides immediate passive income, and you've got many key ingredients needed to accrue market-thumping shareholder returns."", ""Sure, you can find faster growth outside of Coke's consumer staples industry. And Wall Street is worried about slowing demand for traditional sugary sodas. Yet, Coke is diversifying away from these products and into high-growth niches like energy drinks and sparkling water. Additional expected wins here help explain why Coke is so bullish on 2024 and on its long-term outlook."", ""It's always possible that sales trends will disappoint investors over the next few quarters or that another market downturn will make Coca-Cola's shares even cheaper. The beverage titan's growth won't seem as exciting at times when compared to sectors like technology. But investors -- especially fans of dividends -- should still consider keeping this stock near the top of their watch lists."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This natural gas and electricity provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.2%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $4.03 billion, up 16.7% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

The event saw numerous companies on the persistently frothy stock market get as much affection from investors as some people earned from their love-struck sweethearts."", ""Yet in the view of three Motley Fool contributors, certain stocks weren't exactly worthy of those gooey good feelings. They named Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG), General Electric (NYSE: GE), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as three companies that shouldn't have been gifted heart-shaped boxes of chocolates this year."", ""Jason Hall (Plug Power): I'm generally an optimistic investor. And I love a good story, especially one that includes doing something that would be very good for humanity at large. And the story for hydrogen is both exciting and one that would be wonderful for us all. Green hydrogen, a way to store emission-free wind and solar energy in a way that's both high-energy-density and highly portable, would be a massive step forward for global climate change, energy security, and cheaper energy."", 'And few companies have been better at telling that story as a means to raise capital than Plug Power over its history. And for a while, the story, along with some revenue growth, resulted in a stock that absolutely skyrocketed in 2019 and 2020.', 'Yet over the past few years, shares have come crashing back down to earth, from more than $70 at the 2021 peak to around $4 today:', 'What\'s gone wrong? In two words, capital allocation. Over that period, management has deployed most of the billions and billions of dollars it has raised in secondary offerings on projects that simply haven\'t begun to deliver for the company. It\'s gotten so bad that management had to add a ""going concern"" notice to its SEC filings, a warning that it doesn\'t have the capital or liquidity to remain a viable business for another year.', 'As a result, more than $30 billion in shareholder value has evaporated.', ""Could management turn things around? Sure. They have some facilities starting to ramp up that could lower costs. But the company is skating on thin ice with the sharks of insolvency swimming beneath it. I'm glad that I didn't fall for the story that so far doesn't have business results to back it up."", 'Chuck Saletta (General Electric): Former industrial titan General Electric was the very first stock I ever bought on my own in my Roth IRA. I was incredibly proud of myself for wrestling control of my account from my former broker, doing a bit of research, and settling on that well-known behemoth of a company.', 'I originally bought those shares in June of 2002, spending $2,988 to buy them. Aside from the friction-related partial share losses from its reverse split and its various spin-offs, I still own the same position I bought back then. Unfortunately, if I add up the fragmented parts of what it used to be that I now own, it only adds up to around $2,100.', ""So yes, more than two decades after my purchase, my investment in what was once viewed as a virtually unstoppable titan of American industry is worth less than I originally paid for it. While I appreciate the foundational education, it gave me on investing in individual companies, I'm super glad I didn't fall in love with that stock and invest any more in it than I originally did."", 'Some of the key lessons I learned from that experience that still help me today include the following:', 'If a company relies on financial engineering to make its numbers, things can get really bad when the debt market gets tight.', ""Debt ratings are useful for initial screens, but they don't substitute for a decent look at a company's balance sheet and a basic understanding of how it makes its money."", 'What a company does with its dividend can often tell a clearer story about its prospects than what its management says on its calls with the financial media.', ""These days I consider my investment in General Electric as tuition spent to help teach me to become a better investor. It's still a bit painful to look back and realize what I could have had if I had made a more successful choice of where to put my money. All in all, though, I did learn enough from it to successfully keep investing, even through some pretty rough patches in the market. That has certainly put me in a better spot today than I would have been if I had given up on investing entirely when times got tough."", ""Eric Volkman (Tesla): It took some time, but the hype and excitement that helped boost Tesla stock is fading. Although the company certainly has advantages, I'm not convinced it deserved the heaps of investor love and devotion it somehow inspired."", 'It\'s important to remember, first and foremost, that while electric vehicles (EVs) are the favored alt-fuel transport solutions of the moment, they\'re not the only ""green"" option (as Jason mentioned above, hydrogen, for one, has its merits too). I feel that the big rally over the past few years in Tesla stock is based on the assumption that EVs are the only viable eco-friendly option for the future. They are not.', 'Meanwhile, the EV space keeps getting more crowded. These days there are numerous flavors of EV maker to invest in; luxury sedans, for example (Lucid Group), pickups and SUVs (Rivian), and even heavy-duty trucks (Nikola). Tesla is facing determined competition in every one of its product categories.', ""On top of that, it has to contend with the 300-pound gorillas that are the incumbent car makers. Ford, General Motors, and other established players have muscled into EVs and other alt-fuel tech, and they're not about to cede that market to Tesla, or any other upstart."", ""Lately, Tesla's most strategic moves have involved somewhat haphazard price cuts to various models. That's a sign of a company in defense mode, not the acts of a confident market leader. Not surprisingly, Tesla's gross margin has been dropping sharply, falling to less than 19% in its most recently reported quarter from the year-ago figure of almost 26%."", ""Finally, even though Tesla's share price has decelerated considerably of late, the stock's valuations are still awfully high. The price to sales ratio tips the scales at well over 6, while the PEG ratio clocks in at over 2."", ""Ultimately, while I like aspects of Tesla's business and still consider it a pace-setter in the EV world, it's not melting my heart as an investment."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has gained 4.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.57 per share, indicating a change of +5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $27.81 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.7%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'In the case of UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate of $99.64 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.4%. The $401.47 billion and $430.41 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8% and +7.2%, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'UnitedHealth reported revenues of $94.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.1%.

That group includes UnitedHealth, Centene, Elevance and Cigna.', 'However,\xa0Humana and CVS\xa0cut their 2024 earnings outlooks on the heels of last year’s results, and said they expect\xa0elevated medical costs to continue this year.', 'Humana’s outlook is especially grim: The Kentucky-based payer’s earnings expectations for 2024 came in about half as low as analysts had expected.', 'Even payers that emerged from 2023 with their financial outlooks unscathed said they plan to cut benefits or raise premiums this year. The plan redesigns are to protect margins in MA —\xa0a business that historically generates significant profits, but is facing challenges that threaten to kill the golden goose.', 'MA plans have skyrocketed in popularity. More than half of Medicare seniors\xa0are currently signed up for the plans, attracted by benefits like lower monthly premiums and dental and vision coverage. An onslaught of marketing by insurers didn’t hurt, either, as payers jockey for members. Competition is fierce, as MA margins per enrollee can be twice as high\xa0as those in other types of plans.', 'Yet, more members are creating more problems for some insurers because of rising medical utilization. Starting in the second quarter last year, seniors sought out medical care they had delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic,\xa0hiking insurers’ spending.', 'For example, CVS added 800,000 MA enrollees for 2024, mostly nabbed from other payers after CVS aggressively expanded its benefits. But that’s coming back to haunt the Rhode Island-based insurer, which cut its earnings per share outlook for this year due to high medical costs.', 'There are a few potential explanations for what’s driving the elevated utilization, and why\xa0insurers might not have properly forecast the uptick in trend, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Lisa Gill.', 'Enrollees in MA tend to be healthier than those in traditional Medicare. But as more seniors join MA, the program’s risk population could be skewing sicker, Gill wrote in an early February research note. Insurers could have missed early warning signs of higher acuity as seniors avoided doctor’s offices during the pandemic.', 'Higher demand could have also existed earlier, but providers might not have been able to address it because of labor shortages that have now ameliorated, Gill said. Similarly, insurers could have added new MA enrollees with less diagnosis history relative to the rest of their population, resulting in lower visibility into their conditions.', 'Medical loss ratio is a useful metric for understanding how unexpectedly high utilization is affecting insurers.', 'Medical loss ratio, or MLR, is a percentage of how much in healthcare premiums insurers spend on clinical services and quality improvement.\xa0The higher the MLR, the less in premiums insurers are spending on administration or marketing — or retaining as profit. As such, insurers generally try to keep their MLRs low (though within regulatory bounds to avoid sanctions).', 'MLRs soared in payers’ Medicare businesses in the fourth quarter, as the utilization trends that emerged earlier in 2023 conflated with a typical seasonal rise in medical spending during the winter months.', 'Insurers chalked the increase in medical costs up to different drivers.', 'Seniors covered by UnitedHealth and Humana, which together hold almost half of the total MA market share, continued to seek outpatient care in droves in the fourth quarter, including procedures like orthopedic surgeries.', 'UnitedHealth’s members required more spending on seasonal diseases like the flu, COVID or respiratory virus RSV. Elevance, Centene and CVS also reported elevated outpatient care overall for things like elective procedures,\xa0along with higher spend on seasonal needs.', 'That wasn’t the case for Cigna —\xa0which had lower than expected spending on seasonal diseases — and Humana. Humana’s uptick in care was “not respiratory driven,” said CFO Susan Diamond on the payer’s fourth-quarter earnings call in January.', '“We don’t have any clear indicators that it is something you can reasonably assume is seasonal,” Diamond said.', 'As for inpatient care, Centene and CVS didn’t report higher utilization of hospital services than expected.\xa0Elevance also didn’t say that inpatient trends were contributing to growing costs.', 'Yet, UnitedHealth and Humana warned investors about rising inpatient costs, which is concerning for insurers given hospital care is more expensive to cover. UnitedHealth blamed pricey COVID admissions, while Humana said it was seeing more short stays in hospitals across the board.', 'Humana’s Diamond said recent government regulations requiring MA payers to comply with coverage determinations in traditional Medicare could be a potential driver of the higher inpatient spend. The rule requires insurers to cover an inpatient admission if the patient is expected to require hospital care for at least two midnights.', 'Other insurers said they had planned for the so-called “two-midnight rule.”', 'On Feb. 6, Centene CFO Drew Asher told investors that the payer had factored the rule into its planning for 2024. Meanwhile,\xa0CVS CFO Tom Cowhey said one day later the company had adjusted internally in response to the rule.', 'The increase in utilization —\xa0combined with weaker payment rates, changes to MA quality ratings and a shifting risk adjustment model — have created an updraft for MLRs, especially for insurers with high exposure to MA like Humana and UnitedHealth.', 'The big question is how much of this utilization will carry over into this year, and whether payers have properly accounted for utilization changes in their plan designs.', 'Every major insurer besides Elevance expects to record a higher MLR in 2024 than in 2023. Though, the size of the growth ranges from a 0.8 percentage point increase for UnitedHealth to a 2.7 percentage point increase for Humana.', 'The outlier, Elevance, expects its MLR to remain flat.', 'MLR of major U.S. insurers, 2018 to 2024 (projected)', 'In response to the challenging financial environment,\xa0payers —\xa0even those that excelled in controlling medical costs last year —\xa0said they’ve been pulling back benefits,\xa0raising premiums or exiting underperforming markets to boost profitability.', 'That’s true for insurers that expect their MA membership to grow this year (UnitedHealth,\xa0CVS), and those that expect it to fall (Cigna) or stay flat (Elevance).', 'As a result, further growth could be curtailed as payers prioritize margins.', '“We are first and foremost focused on recovering margin, and market share gains is a secondary consideration,”\xa0Brian Kane, who leads CVS’ health benefits division, told investors during its February earnings call.', ""“I look at next year as a year that I think the whole industry will possibly reprice. I don't know how the industry can take this kind of increase in utilization along with regulatory changes that will continue to persist in 2025 and 2026,” Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said on the payer’s earnings call."", 'Insurers said they could revise plans further in light of MA rates for 2025 that the government proposed midway through the earnings reporting season. The rates represent a renewed effort by regulators to rein in growing spending in Medicare.', 'Executives with Humana, Centene and CVS all said the payment changes are insufficient to cover cost trends.\xa0Humana\xa0and Centene said the rule would result in\xa0a 1.6% and 1.3% drop in rates, respectively. (That’s before risk scoring, which should result in an overall increase in reimbursement in 2025).', 'Insurers warned regulators that seniors could see their benefits reduced if they finalize the rates as proposed.', '“We’ll just adjust the bids accordingly,” Asher said on Centene’s call. “The products may be a little less attractive for seniors from an industry standpoint if we don’t make a lot of progress on the final rates.”', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more."", ""Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether."", ' See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', ""In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Group President, Jane Hudis, sold US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$202 per share.

It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$145.

We note Executive VP & General Counsel Deirdre Stanley cashed in US$638k worth of shares. Meanwhile Independent Director Jennifer Hyman bought US$198k worth , as we said above . Because the selling vastly outweighs the buying, we'd say this is a somewhat bearish sign."", ""Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Estée Lauder Companies insiders own 11% of the company, worth about US$5.7b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders."", ""The insider sales have outweighed the insider buying, at Estée Lauder Companies, in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

After all, the consumer staples giant is among the highest-valued companies on the planet that operates outside of the tech niche.', ""But it would be a hard climb for P&G to cross $1 trillion in the seven years that end in 2030.

Microsoft and Apple top the list now with each stock trading at nearly $3 trillion in market capitalization in early 2024.', 'For P&G to reach $1 trillion, it would need to nearly triple its value, rising 170% between now and 2030. Just how reasonable is this growth path?', 'It seems unlikely but not impossible. For context, the stock has gained about 100% in the previous 10 years while the wider Dow was up 140%. P&G would need to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of just under 16% for the next seven years, which is a tall order for a consumer staples giant competing in an industry that tends to grow in the mid-single digits each year.', ""If we include dividends, the picture becomes brighter. P&G's total returns, which account for its rising dividend payments, landed at 170% over the past decade."", ""Sure, a 10-year period is significantly longer than a seven-year period, and these are shareholder returns we're talking about, not market capitalization. Still, it isn't out of the question to think that P&G could give shareholders something close to a 150% return between now and 2030."", ""A lot will depend on how well the business performs in the coming years. P&G said in late January that organic sales were up 4% year over year in the most recent quarter, keeping it on track to post the same level of growth for the full 2024 period. That's a slower expansion than investors have seen in the past few years, although earnings are rising at a faster clip, thanks to price increases. It's reasonable to assume that the consumer staples leader can continue outgrowing its industry while steadily boosting its dividend each year."", 'These wins might translate into about 10% annual returns, but the rest would have to come from an expanding premium for the stock. This would require P&G to boost its profit margins above the rate that investors are used to seeing from this business.', 'Operating income is moving in the right direction, rising to 24% most recently, compared to around 20% in the pre-pandemic period. If P&G can further improve its profitability -- say, to the high 20% range -- then the stock should see higher returns over time.', ""Investors shouldn't get too caught up in whether P&G can hit a certain market-cap milestone. Follow core sales and earnings trends, instead, as successes here will allow stock returns to take care of themselves."", 'The company is more likely to give shareholders steady returns in the low-double-digit range through a combination of capital gains and dividend income, without some of the volatility associated with tech specialists.

GuruFocus has detected 12 Warning Signs with UDR.', ""On February 20, 2024, UDR Inc (NYSE:UDR), a leading real estate investment trust, filed its 10-K report with the SEC, offering a comprehensive view of its financial performance and strategic direction. UDR Inc specializes in owning, operating, and managing multifamily apartment communities across the United States. As of December 31, 2023, UDR Inc's market capitalization stood at approximately $5.5 billion, with a real estate portfolio of 168 communities and a total of 55,550 completed apartment homes. The company's commitment to shareholder value is evident through its consistent dividend payments, with an annualized declared dividend of $1.68 per common share in 2023, marking a 10.5% increase from the previous year. This financial overview sets the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis, providing investors with a clear picture of UDR Inc's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats."", ""Portfolio Diversification and Strategic Capital Allocation: UDR Inc's strategic vision emphasizes the importance of a diversified portfolio, which mitigates market-specific risks and appeals to a broad renter and investor base. The company's portfolio includes properties across 21 markets, with a mix of urban and suburban locations and a balance of high-quality A and B properties. This diversification strategy is supported by UDR Inc's prudent capital allocation, which focuses on investments in markets with strong job formation, income growth, and a favorable multifamily housing demand/supply ratio. By maintaining a diversified portfolio, UDR Inc is better positioned to withstand economic cycles and capitalize on growth opportunities."", ""Commitment to Shareholders: UDR Inc's long-standing history of providing shareholder value is a testament to its financial stability and operational efficiency. The company's 51-year tenure as a REIT and its track record of 204 consecutive quarterly dividends reflect a disciplined approach to financial management and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. The 10.5% increase in the annualized declared dividend in 2023 signals confidence in the company's earnings and cash flow stability, further reinforcing UDR Inc's strength in the market."", ""Development and Construction Risks: UDR Inc's involvement in property development exposes the company to risks associated with construction delays, cost overruns, and lease-up challenges. As of December 31, 2023, UDR Inc was developing two wholly-owned communities with a budget of $187.5 million. While development activities present opportunities for value creation, they also introduce potential weaknesses, such as reliance on market conditions for successful lease-ups and the impact of unforeseen economic downturns on project viability."", ""Market-Specific Vulnerabilities: Despite a diversified portfolio, UDR Inc acknowledges the potential impact of unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions, such as occupancy levels and rental rates. The company's performance is inherently linked to the health of the real estate market, and any downturns in key markets could adversely affect UDR Inc's financial results. This weakness underscores the need for continuous market analysis and adaptive strategies to mitigate the effects of localized economic challenges."", ""Acquisitions and Market Expansion: UDR Inc's strategic focus on acquisitions presents significant opportunities for growth. In 2023, the company acquired six operating communities in Dallas and Austin, Texas, for approximately $354.6 million. These acquisitions align with UDR Inc's goal of increasing its presence in markets with favorable demographics and economic drivers. The company's ability to identify and capitalize on accretive acquisition opportunities can drive portfolio expansion and enhance its competitive position in the multifamily housing sector."", ""Favorable Market Trends: UDR Inc stands to benefit from broader industry trends, such as the increasing propensity to rent and the relative affordability of rental housing compared to homeownership. As societal preferences shift towards flexible living arrangements and urbanization continues, UDR Inc's strategically located properties are well-positioned to capture rising demand. Additionally, the company's focus on markets with strong job growth and income trends supports the potential for rental income growth and occupancy stability."", ""Economic Fluctuations and Competitive Pressures: UDR Inc operates in an industry that is sensitive to economic cycles. Factors such as inflation, interest rate changes, and job market fluctuations can impact the company's operating performance. Moreover, the competitive landscape in the multifamily housing sector requires UDR Inc to continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market share. The company must navigate these threats by employing effective pricing strategies, enhancing property amenities, and ensuring customer satisfaction to remain competitive."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Challenges: UDR Inc faces potential threats from changes in real estate laws, tax laws, and rent control or stabilization laws. Additionally, the company must contend with risks from climate change, including the impact on properties and operations. UDR Inc's proactive approach to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting and its commitment to sustainability initiatives can help mitigate these threats, but regulatory and environmental challenges remain a concern for the company's long-term strategy."", ""In conclusion, UDR Inc's SWOT analysis reveals a company with a strong foundation in portfolio diversification and shareholder commitment, yet not immune to the risks inherent in property development and market-specific vulnerabilities. Opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions and favorable market trends are counterbalanced by threats from economic fluctuations and regulatory challenges.

This financial resilience positions Sherwin-Williams to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain its competitive edge."", ""Raw Material Sourcing and Cost Volatility: A significant challenge for Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW) is the reliance on raw materials that are subject to price fluctuations and availability constraints. The company's cost of goods sold is heavily influenced by the cost of resins, pigments, solvents, and containers, many of which are derived from petrochemical feedstocks.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

These two dividend stock favorites showed off why investors gravitate toward their stellar businesses. Each grew sales through a tough selling environment while demonstrating pricing power on the way to higher profit margins.', 'Their trajectories are different, though, and so are the premiums that investors are being asked to pay for these two businesses.', ""With that in mind, let's look at which stock is the better buy right now."", ""Coke easily wins the growth matchup. The beverage titan reported a 12% organic sales boost for 2023 while Pepsi's growth was less than 10%. Coke benefited from the fact that a high proportion of its sales are in the on-the-go niche -- places like restaurants and sporting events -- which shoppers are prioritizing in the wake of the pandemic."", 'Pepsi still managed to increase sales on top of big gains a year ago. However, its growth came entirely from rising prices. Volumes were down 2% in the food division and slipped 1% in the beverage segment. In contrast, Coke demonstrated more pricing power, with prices and volumes rising throughout 2023.', 'Pepsi did a good job improving its profit margin in 2023 thanks to a combination of rising prices and cost cuts. Core earnings jumped 14% for the year compared to its 9.5% organic sales increase.', ""Yet Coke is the stronger business in this area, too. The beverage giant has some financial advantages that Pepsi lacks, including its focus on profitable drink sales, its massive global sales footprint, and its highly efficient selling infrastructure. These factors help explain why Coke's profit margin is sitting at 30% of sales, or roughly double PepsiCo's result."", ""You'll get plenty of cash returns from holding Coke in your portfolio as well. The company paid $8 billion in dividends last year and spent nearly $2 billion on stock buybacks. That's another way that shareholders can enjoy strong overall returns by holding the leading beverage giant."", ""Pepsi is the cheaper stock, but investors might still prefer paying the premium for Coke over its less expensive rival. Sure, you can own Pepsi for 2.5 times sales, or less than half of Coke's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5.6. You'll get roughly the same 3% dividend yield in either case."", ""Coke stock doesn't just deliver the operating and financial wins outlined above, though. Its outlook also reflects stronger growth potential in 2024 and beyond. Specifically, Coke executives said in early February that organic sales will rise between 6% and 7% this year thanks to solid demand for its core beverages and for relatively new additions to the portfolio, such as sparkling waters and energy drinks."", 'Pepsi, on the other hand, sees sales climbing by just 4% this year thanks to weak demand. ""Category growth rates are normalizing as consumer behaviors largely revert to pre-pandemic norms,"" CEO Ramon LaGuarta told investors recently.', ""Both companies are being impacted by these pressures, although Pepsi is taking a bigger hit. Given their similar dividend yields, along with Coke's stronger cash flow and earnings power, the industry leader seems like the better buy now. That's true even if you'll have to pay a modest premium to own this high-performing consumer staples business."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

The beverage titan recently closed out its fiscal 2023 year and told its shareholders what they can expect for 2024. The update contained some yellow flags worth watching over the next few quarters but was mainly packed with good news on growth and profitability. Let's dive right in."", ""Coke reported a 12% organic sales increase for Q4 and for the full 2023 year. That's a much better result than investors saw from peer PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). The beverage and snack foods giant posted 10% higher sales for the year across its portfolio, alongside a 7% boost in the beverage division."", ""Looking behind that headline figure reveals even more strength from the Coke family of brands. Volume rose 2% even as prices increased at a nearly 10% rate. Pepsi couldn't manage the same level of pricing power; its volume declined 5% this past year. It's great news for future growth that Coke could achieve a balance between price and sales volume gains."", 'This momentum feeds right into Coke\'s brighter outlook for the year ahead. Pepsi warned investors in early February to expect slower growth over the coming quarters due to weaker category demand and decelerating inflation. Coke, on the other hand, sees room for optimism. ""We\'re confident that our all-weather strategy ... will continue to create value for our stakeholders in 2024 and for the long term,"" CEO James Quincey said in a press release.', ""Management put some hard numbers behind those positive comments. Coke is projecting organic sales growth of between 6% and 7% (compared to Pepsi's 4%) for 2024. The company is also expecting earnings gains to outpace revenue growth, likely keeping Coke's profit margin close to its current impressive rate of nearly 30% of sales."", ""As you might expect, investors are being asked to pay a premium for all this financial and operating strength. Coke was one of the worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year, but the shares still sport a high valuation. You'll pay 5.7 times sales for the industry leader compared to PepsiCo's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.5. The valuation gap isn't as pronounced with respect to earnings, but Coke is still the more expensive stock of the two."", ""Even so, investors might consider paying the premium. Coke's profit margin is double that of PepsiCo, the company is growing more quickly, and it has a brighter outlook ahead for organic sales trends. Toss in its 3% dividend yield, which provides immediate passive income, and you've got many key ingredients needed to accrue market-thumping shareholder returns."", ""Sure, you can find faster growth outside of Coke's consumer staples industry. And Wall Street is worried about slowing demand for traditional sugary sodas. Yet, Coke is diversifying away from these products and into high-growth niches like energy drinks and sparkling water. Additional expected wins here help explain why Coke is so bullish on 2024 and on its long-term outlook."", ""It's always possible that sales trends will disappoint investors over the next few quarters or that another market downturn will make Coca-Cola's shares even cheaper. The beverage titan's growth won't seem as exciting at times when compared to sectors like technology. But investors -- especially fans of dividends -- should still consider keeping this stock near the top of their watch lists."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

The target action date for the FDA decision is August 22, 2024. Linvoseltamab is an investigational bispecific antibody designed to bridge B-cell maturation antigen on multiple myeloma cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing.', 'The BLA is supported by data from a Phase 1/2 pivotal trial (LINKER-MM1) investigating linvoseltamab in R/R MM, which were last shared in December 2023. Earlier this month, the European Medicines Agency accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application for linvoseltamab in the same indication.', 'As the second most common blood cancer, it’s estimated 35,000 people will be diagnosed with MM in the U.S. every year. MM is characterized by the proliferation of cancerous plasma cells (MM cells) that crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, infiltrate other tissues and cause potentially life-threatening organ injury. MM is not curable despite treatment advances. While current treatments are able to slow the progression of the cancer, most patients will ultimately experience disease progression and require additional therapies.', 'The linvoseltamab clinical development program includes a Phase 3 confirmatory trial in patients with R/R MM (LINKER-MM3) that is currently enrolling. Additional trials in earlier lines of therapy and stages of disease are planned or underway, including a Phase 1/2 trial in the first-line setting, a Phase 2 trial in high-risk smoldering MM and a Phase 2 trial in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. A Phase 1 trial of linvoseltamab in combination with a Regeneron CD38xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in MM is also planned. For more information, visit the Regeneron clinical trials\xa0website, or contact via clinicaltrials@regeneron.com\xa0or 844-734-6643.', 'Linvoseltamab is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.', 'About the Phase 1/2 TrialThe ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion LINKER-MM1 trial is investigating linvoseltamab in 282 enrolled patients with R/R MM. Eligibility in the Phase 2 portion required patients to have received at least three prior lines of therapy or have triple-class refractory MM. Linvoseltamab was administered with an initial step-up dosing regimen followed by the full dose. Additionally, in the Phase 2 portion, a response-adapted regimen enabled patients treated with linvoseltamab 200 mg who achieved a very good partial response or a complete response to shift from every two-week to every four-week dosing after a minimum of 24 weeks of therapy.', 'The Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial, which is now complete, primarily assessed safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicities across nine dose levels of linvoseltamab exploring different administration regimens. The Phase 2 dose expansion portion is assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of linvoseltamab, with a primary endpoint of objective response rate. Key secondary endpoints include duration of response, progression free survival, rate of minimal residual disease negative status and overall survival.', 'About Regeneron in HematologyAt Regeneron, we’re applying more than three decades of biology expertise with our proprietary\xa0VelociSuite®\xa0technologies to develop medicines for patients with diverse blood cancers and rare blood disorders.', 'Our blood cancer research is focused on bispecific antibodies that are being investigated both as monotherapies and in various combinations and emerging therapeutic modalities.
