1,c18cf705-d8bc-364f-8af6-650628a4b0f4,SCHW,2022-10-15,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) insiders sold US$175m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-corporation-nyse-schw-130052240.html,1665752452,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The fact that multiple The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, for US$19m worth of shares, at about US$69.43 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$74.07. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 0.2% of Charles Schwab's stake.In total, Charles Schwab insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Charles Schwab Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Charles Schwab shares. In total, Founder &amp; Co-Chairman Charles Schwab sold US$34m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Charles Schwab insiders own 6.2% of the company, currently worth about US$8.7b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Charles Schwab Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Charles Schwab stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But it is good to see that Charles Schwab is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Charles Schwab. While conducting our analysis, we found that Charles Schwab has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

We note that the pandemic-led disruptions are likely to persist as concerns for Alibaba’s domestic businesses.However, solid momentum across China and International wholesale businesses is benefiting its China and International commerce businesses, respectively. We expect China commerce and international commerce to be up 6.5% and 8.6% in fiscal 2023 year over year, respectively.Further, strength across the local consumer services, cloud computing business and Cainiao logistics services is contributing well to the top-line growth. Also, well-performing direct sales businesses like Alibaba Health and Freshippo remain tailwinds.

Unfavorable weather conditions and an increase in supply costs adversely impact earnings as well.Nevertheless, through the proper execution of organic projects and strategic acquisitions, is expanding its operations.

3,4dccbd34-4ec2-3e9a-aa24-064c0523525b,ARE,2022-10-15,Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alexandria-real-estate-equities-could-154503965.html,1665762303,STORY,['ARE'],"[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Alexandria Real Estate Equities in FocusAlexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is headquartered in Pasadena, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -39.61% since the start of the year. The life science real estate company is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.18 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.51%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.84% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.79%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.72 is up 5.4% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.11%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Alexandria Real Estate Equities's payout ratio is 58%, which means it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, ARE expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $8.42 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 8.51%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, ARE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

5,fe37e79f-417f-3db5-9c16-492cf4d44698,UNM,2022-10-15,Marathon Petroleum and Ciena Corporation have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-ciena-corporation-highlighted-124912834.html,1665751752,STORY,"['MPC', 'CNA', 'MFC', 'UNM', 'CIEN']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 14, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Marathon Petroleum MPC as the Bull of the Day and Ciena Corporation CIEN asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CNA Financial Corp. CNA, Manulife Financial Corp. MFC and Unum Group UNM.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Marathon Petroleum, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has been a substantial beneficiary of the energy surge this year. The stock has gone on to rally to new all-time highs while the general market continues to hover in bear territory. With inflation stubbornly lingering as we’ve seen over the past few months, MPC is set to continue its dominant trend. MPC sports the highest-possible ‘A’ rating in each of our Zacks Value, Growth, and Momentum Style Score categories, indicating an increased likelihood that the stock continues to propel higher. The powerful combination of relative undervaluation and positive earnings estimate revisions should serve bullish MPC investors well into the future.Marathon Petroleum is a component of the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas – Refining and Marketing industry, which currently ranks in the top 1% out of approximately 250 industry groups. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Quantitative research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s future price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. By targeting stocks contained within leading industry groups, we can dramatically improve our odds of success.Company DescriptionMarathon Petroleum, headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, is engaged in refining, transporting and marketing of petroleum products. MPC also manufactures aromatics, propane, propylene, and sulfur. The company sells refined products to wholesale marketing customers in the United States and internationally.Story continuesMPC stores and distributes crude oil through pipelines, terminals, and barges. Furthermore, it gathers and transports natural gas liquids. Operating in 37 states, the District of Columbia, and Mexico, the energy giant was founded in 1887.Recent Earnings and Future EstimatesMPC has been on a hot streak in terms of earnings surprises, beating estimates in each of the past four quarters – with an average beat of 56.68%. Back in August, the company reported Q2 EPS of $10.61/share, a +15.7% surprise over the $9.17 consensus estimate. When a company is consistently exceeding estimates by this wide of a margin, it typically creates a ‘tailwind’ and boosts price momentum.Revenues for the second quarter of $54.2 billion also topped estimates by 63.08%. MPC has surpassed revenue estimates in each of the last four quarters.In the past 60 days, analysts have raised their Q3 EPS projections by +9.02%. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $6.89 per share, reflecting astounding growth of 843.84% relative to the same quarter last year.Charting the CourseMPC is up nearly 75% this year alone, widely outperforming the major indices. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to weather bear markets and corrections so gracefully. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. And as we know, MPC has seen a recent batch of positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and MPC continues to post earnings beats), the stock should continue its bullish run into next year.Other Factors to ConsiderMarathon Petroleum remains focused on enhancing shareholder value. The company currently pays a $2.23 (2.2%) dividend.In addition, MPC repurchased $4.1 billion worth of shares during Q2 and has now completed more than 80% of its target to buy back $15 billion in common stock.Bottom LineAs an established veteran in the industry, MPC trends remain favorable amid strength in the energy sector. Buoyed by an undervalued and leading industry group along with a maximum overall Zacks VGM score of ‘A,’ it’s not difficult to see why MPC is a compelling investment.A history of large earnings surprises along with a strong technical trend certainly warrant a closer look at this top-rated stock. Recent positive earnings estimate revisions should also serve to create a ‘floor’ in terms of any sudden or unexpected downside moves. If you’re looking for a way to diversify your portfolio, make sure to put MPC on your shortlist.Bear of the Day:Ciena Corporation is a global service provider that supports the routing, delivery, and management of video, data, and voice traffic on communications networks. The company offers hardware networking products, operating system software, multi-domain services and analytics. CIEN sells its products through direct and indirect sales channels to various network operators.The Zacks RundownCIEN, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Fiber Optics industry group, which ranks in the bottom 1% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This industry has underperformed the market at nearly every turn this year.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poor-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.CIEN experienced a climax top in December of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The share price is hitting a series of 52-week lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market continues its downward momentum into the fourth quarter.Recent Earnings Misses &amp; Deteriorating OutlookCIEN has fallen short of estimates in three of the last four quarters. The networking company most recently reported fiscal Q3 earnings last month of $0.33/share, missing the $0.35/share consensus EPS estimate by -5.71%. CIEN has posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of -3.57%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and CIEN is no exception.Ciena has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the fiscal fourth quarter, analysts have decreased estimates by 89.61% in the past 60 days. The Q4 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $0.08/share, reflecting a -90.59% regression relative to the same quarter last year.Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookAs illustrated below, CIEN is in a sustained downtrend. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears. Shares have fallen nearly 48% this year alone.While not the most accurate indicator, CIEN has also experienced what is known as a “death cross”, wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. CIEN would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock.Final ThoughtsA worsening fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to make its way back to new highs anytime soon. The fact that CIEN is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.Our Zacks Style Scores depict a weakening outlook for this stock, as CIEN is rated a worst-possible ‘F’ in our both our Growth and Value categories, paving the way for another ‘F’ in our overall VGM score. While this market remains quite difficult, it’s easy to understand why investors should steer clear of this poorly rated stock.Additional content:Economic uncertainty worsened in the first half of 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a tight monetary policy undertaken by the Federal Reserve and high inflation. In the past year, the S&amp;P 500 index has declined 20.4%. Volatility is expected to continue in the remainder of 2022.Amid this, insurance players like CNA Financial Corp., Manulife Financial Corp. and Unum Group are expected to brave industry headwinds. These have an impressive dividend history and are likely to yield promising returns. Dividends play an important role in limiting portfolio risk as well as market volatility. Regular dividend hikes also indicate profitability of the insurer.The insurance industry is benefiting from improved pricing, increased technology advancements, exposure growth and global expansion as well as an impressive solvency level. Prudent underwriting standards, lower mortality rates, redesigning and repricing of products and services and an improving rate environment should also add to the upside.Per the Global Insurance Market Index by Marsh, global commercial insurance prices increased 9% in the second quarter of 2022. This marked the 19th consecutive quarter in which composite pricing rose, continuing the longest run of increases since the inception of the index in 2012. Per Marsh, global property insurance pricing and casualty pricing increased 6% each on average in the second quarter of 2022.Pricing in financial and professional lines had the highest rate of increase across the major insurance product categories at 16%. Per Willis Towers Watson’s 2022 Insurance Marketplace Realities report, rates will continue to rise but by a small margin. Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte insights, global non-life premiums are estimated to grow 3.7% in 2022.Price hikes, operational strength, higher retention, strong renewal and the appointment of retail agents should help write higher premiums.With a rise in the aging population, the demand for retirement benefits is increasing. Per a report by IBISWorld, the $909 billion U.S. Life Insurance &amp; Annuities Market is expected to grow 2.5% in 2022. Increased vaccinations and economic growth potential instill confidence.The insurers remain exposed to catastrophe loss from natural disasters and weather-related events, which induce volatility in their underwriting results. Per Colorado State University (CSU), the 2022 above-average hurricane season may have 19 named storms, including nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes. This year’s hurricane season could be about 130% of the average season per CSU. Global estimated insured losses from natural catastrophes in the first half of 2022 were $35 billion, 22% above average of the past 10 years ($29 billion), per a report by Swiss Re Institute.Exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed declared the third consecutive 75 basis point increase in the Federal Funds rate. Currently, the interest rate is in the range of 3%-3.25%. Insurers, being direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are poised to gain. To check high levels of inflation, the Fed will continue to rise interest rates, which will improve investment results.Banking on operational efficiency, which leads to a solid capital position, insurers continue to engage in strategic mergers and acquisitions to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography and deploy capital to enhance shareholder value.Insurers have increased investment in emerging technologies in a bid to drive efficiency, enhance cybersecurity, upgrade policy administration and claims systems as well as expand automation capabilities across the organization. Deloitte’s Global survey projects insurers’ technology budget to increase 13.7% in 2022.Best 3 Dividend Stocks to WatchWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected three insurance stocks with a dividend yield of more than 2% and they have grown dividends over the past five years. These stocks also have a payout ratio of less than 60 and carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This compares to earnings of $1.17 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 19.27%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this biggest U.S. mortgage lender would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of -3.90%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Wells Fargo , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, posted revenues of $19.51 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.22%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $18.83 billion.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Wells Fargo: mixed.

7,ecfc792d-eab8-3486-a367-574b6a6166d9,USB,2022-10-15,"After losing 26% in the past year, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-26-past-u-bancorp-120113357.html,1665835273,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 68% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 6.4% increase in share prices after a year of 26% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about U.S. Bancorp. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in U.S. Bancorp. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at U.S. Bancorp's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. U.S. Bancorp is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with ownership of 8.1%. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.7% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.7% of the company stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$87m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in U.S. Bancorp. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 8.1% of the U.S. Bancorp shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.30 per share.Results have been primarily aided by increased net interest income, supported by higher interest rates and loan growth. However, a decline in non-interest income and higher expenses were the undermining factors. Also, the company’s credit quality deteriorated in the reported quarter.Net income (GAAP basis) was $1.82 billion, down from the prior-year quarter’s $2.03 billion.Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal net revenues were $6.30 billion, up 7.4% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.28 billion.The tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.86 billion, up 20.6% from the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the impact of rising interest rates on earning assets and strong growth in loan and investment securities balances, partially offset by deposit pricing, lower loan fees related to the forgiveness of PPP loans from a year ago, and funding mix.Average earning assets climbed 7.6% year over year, supported by growth in average investment securities and average total loans, partially offset by lower average interest-bearing deposits with banks.The net interest margin (NIM) of 2.83% increased 30 basis points year over year mainly due to the impacts of higher rates on earning assets, partially offset by deposit pricing and short-term borrowing costs.Non-interest income decreased 8.3% on a year-over-year basis to $2.47 billion. The decline was primarily due to a fall in mortgage banking revenues and net securities gains.Non-interest expenses, including merger and integration charges, climbed 6.1% year over year to $3.64 billion.The efficiency ratio was 57.5%, lower than the year-ago quarter’s 58.4%.

That is, insiders acquired the stock in greater numbers than they sold it.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider Marc Oken bought US$837k worth of shares at a price of US$167 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$156 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Marc Oken was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$188m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies shares in the last quarter. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies.

Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This regional bank holding company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4.55%.For the most recent quarter, Huntington Bancshares was expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share, but it reported $0.36 per share instead, representing a surprise of 5.88%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.31 per share, while it actually produced $0.32 per share, a surprise of 3.23%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Huntington Bancshares lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Huntington Bancshares currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.72%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 21, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis regional bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.84 billion, up 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Huntington Bancshares?For Huntington Bancshares, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.72%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Huntington Bancshares will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Huntington Bancshares would post earnings of $0.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.36, delivering a surprise of +5.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Huntington Bancshares appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, Commerce Bancshares (CBSH) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.04 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $384.63 million, up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Commerce has been revised 1.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.72%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Commerce will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The share prices don’t tend to fall as much as unprofitable and unproven stocks that are viewed as more speculative investments.Blue-chip stocks also tend to recover faster in periods when the markets rise again. That said, there are plenty of cheap blue-chip stocks that are down 20% or more amid this year’s market rout, presenting attractive entry points for investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven cheap blue-chip stocks to buy before they rebound.AAPLApple’s$142.60PEPPepsiCo’s$180.19HDHome Depot $310.16VVisa $203.23BACBank of America$37.69BRK-BBerkshire Hathaway$296.72FFord$14.17Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comThe consumer electronics giant has not been immune to this year’s market downturn. So far in 2022, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has fallen 25% making it one of the best cheap blue-chip stocks to buy. Rather than fret about the selloff, investors should use the decline in the share price to buy Apple stock hand over fist.Silicon Valley-based Apple remains one of the biggest and best technology companies in the world and it is rare that investors get a chance at such a favorable entry point with the stock, which is currently trading at $136 a share.AAPL stock recently took a big hit after it was reported that Covid-19 lockdowns in China are impacting production of its newest iPhone. However, this is a temporary problem. Innovation and market dominance should help Apple weather the current storm.Story continuesLong-term the company, and its stock, should be just fine.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comSnack and beverage company PepsiCo’s (NASDAQ:PEP) share price is actually up this year, having gained 5% compared to a 34% decline in the Nasdaq. PEP stock is currently trading at $180 a share, near its 52-week high.The company’s products, which include everything from the Pepsi soft drink and Frito Lay chips to Quaker Oatmeal and the Gatorade sports drink, are considered essential grocery items by the consumers who love them.In 2021, PepsiCo generated $79 billion in revenue from its food and beverage products. The company barely missed a beat during the Covid-19 pandemic as sales of its consumer products held up remarkably well.PepsiCo is also managing the current inflationary environment thanks to its pricing power, or ability to raise prices without losing customers.Plus, PepsiCo pays a dividend that currently yields a strong 2.54% or $1.15 a share each quarter.In March of this year, PepsiCo announced that it is raising its dividend by 7%, bringing the total increase over the past five years to 43%. The company is also buying back $1.5 billion of PEP stock this year, making it one of the cheap blue-chip stocks to buy with a bright future.Home Depot (HD)Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue skySource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.comHome Depot (NYSE:HD) stock is down 29% this year making it one of the hottest cheap blue-chip stocks to buy. Now is an opportune time to grab HD stock at a deeply discounted price.Long term, Home Depot is likely to remain a great investment given its dominance of the home renovation and do-it-yourself home repair markets. Even with this year’s decline, Home Depot’s stock has still gained 78% over the past five years.The second quarter results this year built on the strongest first-quarter sales on record for Home Depot. Looking ahead, Home Depot has stood by its forecast for total and comparable sales to grow by 3% for all of this year.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V), one of the three largest credit card issuers in the world, currently sits 11% lower than where it was trading at before the pandemic. It is one of the cheap blue-chip stocks to keep your eyes on.Coming out of the pandemic, with travel and in-person dining resuming, V stock was expected by many analysts to rebound strongly.The slow return of higher-margin international transactions on its credit cards has been a drag on the stock.Visa is also grappling with the loss of its Russian business following that country’s invasion of Ukraine. Yet, despite its current issues, Visa remains a solid long-term investment.Over the past five years, the stock has returned 75% to shareholders. Visa is currently selling for 25 times this year’s projected earnings, which is rock bottom for the company.Bank of America (BAC)A photo of the Bank of America (BAC) logo in neon red and blue on a tan wall.Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comBank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock looks extremely cheap at its current price. Down 20% on the year amid a broad selloff in all bank stocks, BAC shares are currently one of the cheapest blue-chip stocks to buy before they rebound.The share price decline doesn’t take away from the fact that Bank of America, the second biggest lender in the U.S., remains a very appealing long-term investment.Bank of America should perform well going forward as the interest on its variable rate loans resets at higher levels following rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.Additionally, Bank of America has improved its deposit base, which now sits at $1 trillion, and has invested significantly in technology to improve its online presence and electronic transactions.Plus, Bank of America has a big wealth management arm, and its trading unit continues to make hay out of the current stock market volatility. All and all, BAC stock remains a safe bet for investors.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comConsidered by many to be the ultimate blue-chip stock, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has proven time and again that its share price can outperform the market in any environment.And, for now, it’s among the cheap blue-chip stocks that have room to run.Berkshire Hathaway owns a massive portfolio of stocks valued at more than $300 billion.Buffett’s careful portfolio construction and buy-and-hold strategy has famously carried Berkshire Hathaway through many a market downturn, from the Black Monday crash of 1987 to the dot-com bubble bursting in 2000 and the 2008-09 financial crisis. Each time BRK.B stock has emerged stronger on the other side.The company just reported strong third-quarter financial results that showed a 20% increase in its operating profit. The company also bought back $1 billion of its own stock in the July through September period.Ford (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comShares of legendary automaker Ford (NYSE:F) have been beaten up more than most cheap blue-chip stocks this year. The Detroit-based company has seen its share price knocked down 38% year to date.While the market downturn is mostly to blame, Ford has also been hurt by ongoing difficulties with global supply chains that have made it difficult to source the parts needed for its vehicles, which has, in turn, slowed its production.Yet, long term there’s plenty to like about Ford and its stock. The company is pushing hard into electric vehicles and has made no bones about the fact that it wants to challenge market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for supremacy in the space.Electric versions of its iconic vehicles such as the Mustang sports car and F-150 pick-up truck could help the Detroit automaker gain market share and eventually become a global leader in the fast-growing EV sector.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL, V and BAC.

They've fallen to $3.91 a gallon as of Thursday, according to data from the American Automobile Association – but started rising again for the first time in 99 days last month.The White House has repeatedly emphasized falling prices at the pump, which have brought much-needed relief to American drivers at a time when inflation is running red-hot.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Biden pushed for OPEC+ members to raise their crude production levels in a bid to keep gas prices low. But the cartel – which counts Russia and Saudi Arabia among its most prominent members – instead voted to cut its output by around 2 million barrels a day.That could push prices at the pump higher on the east and south coasts, as well as in the northeast and the Rockies, GasBuddy strategist Patrick DeHaan said last week.China and semiconductorsBiden has also cracked down on China ahead of the midterms.His administration introduced export controls last week that will limit the sales of semiconductors made with US technology to companies that have a special license.Chinese chip stocks plummeted after the announcement – while US-listed giants Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices also each slipped by over 1%.Story continuesThe Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks the 30 largest US chipmaker stocks, has slumped just under 44% this year – meaning it has significantly underperformed even the 25% loss suffered by the benchmark S&amp;P 500.Biden's export controls could fuel further sell-offs, analysts have warned.""It's as if the market is implying the last two years of semi growth were a mirage, engineered by central banks, and need to wiped clean,"" Bank of America said in a research note this week.Russian metal sanctionsDemocrats' next major policy move could be imposing further sanctions against Russia – as Biden looks to show he's cracking down on Moscow.The Biden administration is weighing up restricting imports of Russian aluminum, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.Having already banned imports of Russian oil and gas, that policy would aim to choke off another potential source of income for Russia and Vladimir Putin.Aluminum prices rallied 5.8% to $2,330 an ounce after Reuters reported the potential import ban, while the Dow Jones Aluminum Index spiked 7%.Read more: Biden shushes economists' recession warnings: 'Every six months they say this'Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The US now claiming Saudi Arabia pushed other OPEC+ nations to vote to cut oil production last week. Yahoo Finance senior columnist Rick Newman is here with the details. Rick, Saudi is looking to send a message to the United States?RICK NEWMAN: It seems that way. They are not doing the United States a favor here and they're being pretty overt around it-- about it. So let's recall President Biden did make a pilgrimage, if you will, to Saudi Arabia over the summer. This is after he called the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a pariah for orchestrating the murder of Jamal Khashoggi four years ago. So Biden basically went over to make amends and we know he did that because he wanted Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to get prices down and help with the economic war against Russia. So Saudi clearly has been behind this agreement by the OPEC+ nations, which includes Russia, by the way, to actually cut production rather than increase production. So now Biden says there will be consequences for this.The Saudi foreign ministry-- this was unusual-- they actually released a statement a couple of days ago saying, we push-- we're pushing back against these allegations that we're trying to help Russia out. These were purely for economic reasons that we want to cut production. And you've got a lot of members of Congress now, including some senators who run important committees, saying we need to do something like curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or find other ways to basically punish them for this decision. So it's getting ugly.- So then, Rick, in terms of actual leverage, obviously there tends to be a lot of rhetoric when these things come up. But in terms of what can actually be done, how much leverage does the US have, either on its own or if it teams up with allies on this?Story continuesRICK NEWMAN: The United States is a major arms supplier to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia needs those weapons because they have a militant foe right across the Arabian Gulf in Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are long, sworn enemies. And there has been kinetic military action between those two nations in the past. So they need American weaponry, including things like Patriot air defense missile batteries. So the United States could remove some US weapons that are there to help defend Saudi Arabia. They-- the United States could also decide not to sell Saudi Arabia weapons and, say, ""Well, why don't you go to your buddy Russia and get weapons from them?"" Of course, Russia is running out of weapons because they're firing all their own weapons at Ukraine. So that's one thing the United States could do.But it might backfire, in terms of the oil markets, because we are just going to be somewhat dependent on oil-producing nations, such as Saudi Arabia, because in those nations the government decides how much oil to produce. That is totally different from what happens here. The US government cannot go to Exxon or Chevron and say you need to increase oil production by 10% or 20%. And here in the United States, energy firms they do not want to invest in huge fossil fuel energy projects anymore because they don't think they're going to get their money back. They know this is a declining industry. The Saudi government on the other hand, can keep making those types of investments.So, in the future, I think governments like Saudi Arabia could be even more important to fossil fuel industries than they are now. So President Biden has to think about the long-term consequences of anything he's likely to do.- Certainly a delicate balancing act indeed. Thanks for breaking that down for us. Our very own Rick Newman. Have a good weekend.]"

""Our share of it is very small. So we're very comfortable.""Morgan Stanley also scaled back its leveraged exposure in the third quarter.Story continues""They actually were quite modest marks, given the environment,"" Sharon Yeshaya, Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, told analysts.The Wall Street giant is leading a group of banks to provide $12.5 billion in debt financing Tesla CEO Elon Musk's buyout of social media giant Twitter Inc.Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said his bank has been ""quite cautious in the leveraged finance arena."" He later added, ""Frankly, it's just not that troubling.""The turmoil in the leveraged finance market is also weighing on mergers and acquisitions, which slowed sharply in the third quarter.""There’s no doubt that the cost of capital has gone up materially for debt financing of private equity transactions over the past 6-9 months,"" said Kevin Sterling, global co-Head of private credit at Goldman Sachs during an event this month. That means borrowers need more cash to operate in an environment with higher costs, he said. (Reporting by Saeed Azhar, Mehnaz Yasmin and Matt Tracy; Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Josie Kao)]"

The Federal Reserve has raised the benchmark interest rate from near zero in March to the current range of 3.00% to 3.25% and signaled more increases.Rising rates tend to buoy bank profits, but the broader risk of an economic downturn sparked by high inflation, supply-chain bottlenecks and the war in Ukraine could weigh onfuture earnings.On a conference call, Dimon said U.S. consumers remained strong and he wasn't predicting a recession but ""there are a lot of headwinds out there.""Money that people have in their checking accounts will ""deplete probably by sometime midyear next year"" while they are contending with headwinds like inflation, higher rates and higher mortgage rates, he cautioned.Banks set aside more money in preparation for a hit from a potential economic slowdown. JPMorgan set aside $808 million in reserves, Citi added $370 million to reserves and Wells had a $385 million increase in the allowance for credit losses.Still, shares of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo gained strongly, up 2.5% and 3.7% respectively while Citi gained 1.2% as the profit falls were not as deep as feared.Story continuesJPM also said it hopes to be able to resume stock buybacks early next year, although other banks were less bullish with Citi saying buybacks continue to be on hold and Wells Fargo saying it continues to beprudent about buybacks.""JPMorgan delivered a solid set of results, from top to bottom,"" Susan Roth Katzke, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note. ""At least equally as important is the evidence of preparedness to manage through whatever turn the macro takes; expect the latter to be in focus.""JPMorgan reported a 17% drop in third-quarter profit to $9.74 billion, although that was less than had been feared. Wells Fargo posted a 31% decline to $3.53 billion but it also beat expectations. And Citi reported a 25% drop to $3.5 billion which also beat expectations.""Most of these banks are making more spread income now than ever because of the change in interest rates,"" said Chris Marinac, Director of Research at Janney Montgomery Scott. ""And this was the first quarter where you had the full effect of the Fed, because the Fed increased a little bit in May.""JPMorgan said net interest income rose 34% to a record $17.6 billion, up 34%.""Generally banks obviously seem to be benefiting from a higher rate environment, and we've obviously seen banks able to earn, in terms of revenues, on higher interest rates,"" said Eric Theoret, global macro strategist at Manulife Investment Management.Marinac said investors would want to see banks build reserves at this point in the economic cycle.""They're bracing for a hard landing, because they're building the reserves,"" said Marinac. ""But that's not necessarily a bad thing.""While a number of the banks managed to beat expectations, Morgan Stanley reported a 30% slump in profit to $2.49 billion which missed estimates. Its shares fell 5%.Morgan Stanley's earnings showed that investment banking revenue more than halved to $1.3 billion with declines across the bank's advisory, equity and fixed income segments.James Gorman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Morgan Stanley, said his firm's performance was ""resilient and balanced in an uncertain and difficult environment.""Corporations' interest in mergers, acquisitions and initial public offerings dried up, particularly hitting banks strong in investment banking. Global M&amp;A lost ground in the third quarter with volumes in the United States plummeting nearly 63% as the rising cost of debt forced companies to postpone big buyouts.While banks were optimistic they could weather the likely tougher economy ahead, some observers were concerned about the long term outlook for growth.“Against the backdrop of economic headwinds, the solid earnings reports from this morning will quickly pass into the rearview mirror,"" said Peter Torrente, KPMG US National Sector Leader for Banking and Capital Markets. ""Worries of inflation, which shows little sign of slowing down, are casting a long shadow on future outlook.""Torrente said while banks' revenues reflect the benefit of rising interest rates and persisting loan demand, the buildup in loan loss provisions also reflects the uncertainty in the road ahead.""Next quarter and beyond, credit risk, loan growth, and deposit balances will be key areas to monitor in the banking industry,"" Torrente said.(Reporting by Saeed Azhar and Lananh Nguyen and Davide Barbuscia in New York, Noor Zainab Hussain, Niket Nishant, Mehnaz Yasmin, Sweta Singh and Manya Saini in Bengaluru Writing by Megan Davies Editing by Lananh Nguyen, Mark Potter, David Gregorio and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

46,0eed7336-523e-34eb-bb7b-1fd626e1ef95,FE,2022-10-15,FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of $0.39,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergy-nyse-fe-due-pay-134331794.html,1665755011,STORY,['FE'],"[FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.39 per share on the 1st of December. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 4.2%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for FirstEnergy FirstEnergy's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, FirstEnergy's dividend was only 66% of earnings, however it was paying out 234% of free cash flows. While the company may be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business at this time, we think that a cash payout ratio this high might expose the dividend to being cut if the business ran into some challenges.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 19.1%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 58% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.20 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.56. This works out to be a decline of approximately 3.4% per year over that time. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. It's encouraging to see that FirstEnergy has been growing its earnings per share at 67% a year over the past five years. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.In SummaryIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about FirstEnergy's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While FirstEnergy is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

47,9f7e358f-1646-3d25-ae86-6fc27ceb711d,CRM,2022-10-15,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-trending-stock-130001394.html,1665752401,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has lost 8.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share, indicating a change of -4.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.72 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.56 indicates a change of +17.8% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $7.82 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14%. The $30.94 billion and $35.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.8% and +14.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.8%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.34%. The EPS surprise was +16.67%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s growth strategy focuses on three critical areas, enhancing the franchise network, improving relationships with repair shop owners and managers and expanding critical industries in emerging markets.It has been on track with its Rapid Continuous Improvement process and other cost-reduction initiatives. The RCI process is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs. Management has been boosting customer services and enhancing manufacturing and supply chain capabilities through the RCI initiatives and further investments. All the aforesaid factors should have contributed to the company’s top- and bottom-line performances in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Snap-on continues to reel under supply-chain headwinds, which is likely to have hurt third-quarter performance.

59,140cc78a-419b-377f-9ad6-53a99d254326,MSI,2022-10-15,"Institutional investors may adopt severe steps after Motorola Solutions, Inc.'s (NYSE:MSI) latest 3.8% drop adds to a year losses",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-may-adopt-severe-153629226.html,1665761789,STORY,['MSI'],"[A look at the shareholders of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 87% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.8% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 6.8% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Motorola Solutions, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Motorola Solutions. Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Motorola Solutions?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Motorola Solutions already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Motorola Solutions, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Motorola Solutions. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.4% and 7.1% of the stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Motorola SolutionsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Motorola Solutions, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$136m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Virtual Reality Stocks to Buy.Advances in semiconductor fabrication and manufacturing have enabled chip makers to squeeze unthinkable amounts of computing power into pieces of silicon the size of a human thumbnail. This growth has also spurred industries of its own, and one such sector is the virtual reality segment of the broader technology industry.Virtual reality, as the name suggests, refers to technologies that create an artificial representation of reality for users to immerse themselves into - whether for entertainment or productivity needs. This is achieved through headsets, processors, and software, with different companies providing different technologies for the processes.The virtual reality industry was estimated to be worth $4.4 billion in 2020, and through a massive compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44.8%, the segment can be worth a whopping $84 billion in 2029, according to a research report from Fortune Business Insights. Driving this growth will be several factors, such as the demand for virtual training platforms in industries, that let firms prepare their employees for complex tasks without investing in physical infrastructure. This allows companies in industries such as automobile manufacturing to reduce worker injuries and conduct factory personnel training safely.Another research report, this time from Valuates Report, analyzes both the virtual and augmented reality markets. Augment reality is a subset of virtual reality that serves as a 'bolt on' to existing reality instead of rendering a completely new environment. This research firm believes that the markets were worth $14 billion in 2020 and through a strong CAGR of 41%, they will grow to sit at $454 billion by the end of 2030.Therefore, looking at these estimates, it's clear that virtual reality has a bright future ahead of it, despite the bloodbath in technology stocks this year. Today's piece will look at the key players in the industry and some well known firms in the list are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Meta Platforms, Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy Now. According to PwC’s Global Entertainment and Media Outlook, the gaming industry is rapidly growing and the sector is anticipated to reach $321 billion by 2026. The expansion is supported by millions of people who got involved with gaming to escape the isolation of COVID-19 lockdowns. Gaming was one of the safest ways to maintain social connections amid the pandemic-driven chaos, and the sector has not lost steam despite lockdowns lifting worldwide. Existing and new gamers poured into games, consoles, and other gaming equipment during the pandemic, and resultantly, the market grew by 26% between 2019 and 2021. Companies timed their new releases and game launches strategically to gain from the pandemic boom. For example, Nintendo’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons was launched in March 2020 and within the first six weeks, 13.4 million units were sold. It features as one of the best-selling Nintendo Switch games.As per latest data published by DataReportal, internet traffic rose by 7.7% in 2021 compared to 2020. Moreover, the number of internet users grew by 4% to 4,950 million in January 2022 compared to the same period last year, when the users equaled 4,758 million. Using cloud technology in the gaming market will potentially boost the demand and engagement of multiplayers for numerous games, which will support further market growth. Some of the best gaming stocks to consider in order to play the boom in the sector include Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Our Methodology We selected the following gaming stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and future growth prospects. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. Story continues12 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Erik Mclean on UnsplashBest Gaming Stocks To Buy Now12. Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) was founded in 1889 and is headquartered in Kyoto, Japan. The company develops, manufactures, and sells home entertainment products in Japan, the Americas, Europe, and internationally. Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) provides video game platforms, playing cards, handheld and home console hardware systems, and related software. A depreciating yen will act as a tailwind for Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY)’s reported financials. On September 7, Goldman Sachs analyst Minami Munakata resumed coverage of Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) with a Buy rating and an 83,000 yen price target. The analyst expects Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) to sustain an elevated level of earnings, even in the midst of the product cycle for Nintendo Switch, the analyst told investors.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, Andrew Wellington and Jeff Keswin’s Lyrical Asset Management and Frederick Disanto’s Ancora Advisors collectively held stakes worth $738,000 in Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY). Like Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) is one of the best gaming stocks to buy now.Here is what Ensemble Capital has to say about Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Nintendo: Having had a banner year and a quarter last year with both its Switch console sales and megahit Animal Crossing: New Horizons game release, helped in part by COVID restrictions, Nintendo posted sales that were down -10% vs a year ago while operating income was down -17%. Consequently, the stock has had a challenged performance in the quarter, falling 19%. However, looking past the one-time nature of the comparison effects of the COVID bump last year, the more important fundamental metric to track for the company’s future business is its installed base of Switch consoles. The Switch installed base of customers has grown by about 50 million units to over 85 million since 2019, aided by a surge in interest in family gaming. We believe the family gaming trend is an important and persistent one and the huge increase in the installed base bodes well for future game and digital subscription sales going forward.”11. Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 10Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) is a California-based company that designs, markets, and distributes gaming and streaming equipment, components, and systems in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific. The company offers gaming peripherals such as gaming keyboards, mice, headsets, controllers, capture cards, stream decks, USB microphones, studio accessories, and EpocCam software. Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) is one of the best gaming stocks to invest in.After Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) negatively pre-announced its Q2 revenue and adjusted EBITDA along with its earnings date announcement, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter noted that slower user growth will likely extend Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR)’s upgrade cycle in the short-term, though he acknowledged that Q2 is ""likely the trough."" The analyst, who expects a return to ""normal"" in 2023 ""at the latest,"" reiterated an Outperform rating and a $22 price target on Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) shares. He is positive that Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) has developed a ""defensible niche"" with a majority of its sales originating from ""a small, but dedicated and growing base of hard-core gamers.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 10 hedge funds were long Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 12 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent position holder in the company, with 547,574 shares worth $7.19 million. Here is what Sterling Partners Equity Advisors has to say about Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Corsair Gaming is a global developer and manufacturer of high-performance gear and technology for gamers, content creators, and PC enthusiasts. Corsair delivers a full ecosystem of products; PC Components, Peripherals, Premium Streaming Equipment, and Smart Ambient Lighting. Corsair responded to the difficult sourcing and shipping environment by building inventory closer to its customers. Management believes that once this difficult supply chain is behind them their targeted growth and profitability targets will return. We believe in the growing gaming market globally and Corsair is positioned well to support this growing customer base with a platter of products.”10. Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the company is engaged in the ownership and operation of a diversified entertainment platform in the United States. Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) has four key segments – Nevada Casino Resorts, Nevada Locals Casinos, Maryland Casino Resort, and Distributed Gaming. The Distributed Gaming segment operates slot machines and amusement devices in non-casino locations, including restaurants, bars, liquor stores, and grocery stores. Jefferies analyst Cassandra Lee on September 7 assumed coverage of Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) with a Buy recommendation and a $64 price target. Given the company's ""balance sheet strength and strong fundamentals"" across regional markets in Nevada, it could chase growth more intensely or increase shareholder returns with the proceeds from Rocky Gap sale, ""either of which imply continued upside,"" the analyst told investors in a bullish thesis. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 21 funds reported owning stakes worth $163.6 million in Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) at the end of June 2022, compared to 21 in the prior quarter worth $276.2 million. Richard Driehaus’ Driehaus Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 1.13 million shares valued at nearly $45 million. 9. PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Next on our list of the best gaming stocks is PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN), a Pennsylvania-based company that provides integrated entertainment, sports content, and casino gaming experiences in North America. On October 10, PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) signed a new leasing arrangement with Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (NASDAQ:GLPI) to promote casino growth and relocations. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be effective from January 1, 2023.On October 6, Canaccord analyst Jason Tilchen initiated coverage of PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) with a Buy rating and a $50 price target. Commercial gambling in the U.S. exceeded $50 billion in gross gaming revenue for the first time last year, noted the analyst, who forecasts the industry to nearly double over the next decade. At present levels, investors can access ""a very reasonably valued, consistent, and strongly profitable regional casino business"" with upside from the quickly expanding online sports betting and iGaming markets, the analyst added.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 33 hedge funds were long PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 36 funds in the preceding quarter. Parag Vora’s HG Vora Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.50 million shares worth $106.5 million. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) declined 28.3% in the quarter and penalized performance by 71 bps. This was due to investor concerns that a potential recession would result in a slowdown or decline in growth. The company has seen no material change to its visitation or spending levels, and its earnings remain strong. Penn is generating strong cash flow to more than offset investments in its digital growth opportunity. It is using excess cash to buy back its stock. Penn is well positioned to weather a slowdown or recession and, if one does occur, the company should still generate revenue and EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels.Management continues to use its excess cash for share repurchases and debt reduction as well as continuing investments in its digital businesses. We think the $50 million of losses this year from its digital business is modest in relation to Penn’s $1 billion of casino EBITDA. The losses from its digital business represent customer acquisition costs incurred as additional states legalize online gambling. Since it is far less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, we expect marketing costs to decline as Penn builds its customer base.Penn’s core bricks and mortar casino business remains strong, and the company has a healthy regional casino business and a strong balance sheet to fund its digital losses.”8. International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) is a London-based company that provides gaming technology products and services in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The company has three primary segments – Global Lottery, Global Gaming, and Digital &amp; Betting. On October 6, International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) announced that its cashless gaming solutions, Resort Wallet and IGTPay, were being used at Indigo Sky Casino in Wyandotte, Okla. International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) is helping multiple casino operators such as Indigo Sky Casino transition to cashless gaming and modernize the guest experience. It is one of the best gaming stocks to buy now. On August 3, Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli reiterated a Buy rating on International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) but trimmed the price target on the stock to $30 from $35 after the ""solid"" Q2 results.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) was part of 34 public stock portfolios at the end of Q2 2022, with collective stakes worth $263.5 million. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is a significant position holder in the company, with 1.86 million shares valued at $34.6 million. Here is what Palm Harbour Capital has to say about International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“The second largest contributor was International Game Technology, the ItalianAmerican lottery and slot machine company, which we introduced in our first quarter 2020 letter and which contributed 78 basis points to performance. Early in the quarter, IGT’s main competitor, the highly levered Scientific Games, entered into a definitive agreement to sell its lottery business to Brookfield Business Partners for total consideration of $6.1 billion in cash and contingent payout. At $471 million last twelve months EBITDA (admittedly COVID affected, excluding unallocated central costs), Scientific Games lottery business was sold at trailing 13.0x. Scientific Games exited the lottery business to optimize the portfolio and aggressively de-lever its balance sheet. We believe IGT’s lottery business to be much higher quality and certainly larger. If we were to use a similar metric for IGT, including all corporate costs but excluding Gaming and Digital and Betting, we would have around 90% upside. We are willing to bet the Gaming and fast growing Digital and Betting segments are worth something as well. It seems the sell-side willfully ignores this transaction and sticks with their 7-8x EV/EBITDA valuation.The company reported third quarter earnings with sales up by 21% year on year, EBIT up by 144% and leverage down to 3.8x from 6.4x at year-end 2020. Total Adjusted EBITDA improved by 42% with margin gaining 618 basis points. Following the recovery, management reinstated the dividend of $0.20 per share…” (Click here to see the full text)7. Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Featuring next on our list of the best gaming stocks is Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), a Las Vegas-based multi-jurisdictional gaming company that owns entertainment properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. On September 15, Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on October 15, to shareholders of record as of September 30. JMP Securities analyst Jordan Bender initiated coverage of Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) on September 23 with an Outperform rating and a $65 price target. The macro backdrop in Nevada, including home prices and taxable sales, remains solid, driving a robust spend per head in the locals/downtown market where Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) generates 39% of its earnings, the analyst told investors. He noted that Nevada is one of the healthiest gaming markets.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 35 hedge funds were long Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), compared to 40 funds in the earlier quarter. John W. Rogers’ Ariel Investments is a notable position holder in the company, with 3.35 million shares worth $167 million. Here is what Baron Real Estate Fund has to say about Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Boyd Gaming Corporation is one of the largest and most successful casino entertainment companies in the U.S. The company owns and operates 28 casino gaming properties in 10 states with a large presence in Las Vegas. Business conditions have been strong, yet the shares are valued at only 6 times 2022 estimated cash flow versus a long-term average of more than 9 times cash flow. The company maintains a strong and liquid balance sheet. Insiders own approximately 27% of the company. We believe Boyd is a compelling acquisition target.”6. Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in San Mateo, California. The company develops and operates an online entertainment, gaming, and educational platform. In August, Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) reported a year-over-year increase in daily active users, estimated bookings, and estimated revenue. On October 13, BTIG analyst Clark Lampen maintained a Buy rating on Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) but lowered the price target on the shares to $51 from $58. The analyst updated his estimates ahead of the September metrics to factor in ""more conservative monetization assumptions and sustained hourly monetization headwinds"". He remains optimistic on the stock in the longer term, citing his latest checks with mobile gaming developers and ad executives, who have been constructive on the opportunity for in-gaming advertising for Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX).According to Insider Monkey’s data, Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) was part of 38 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 11.6 million shares worth $380.5 million. In addition to Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) is one of the best gaming stocks to play the boom in the sector. Tao Value, an investment management firm, discussed the performance of  Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the fund said:“Roblox (RBLX) got significant more attention from both institutional &amp; retail investors after Facebook announced to rename itself as Meta Platforms. I believe the price appreciation is largely attributed to the increased attention. On the business side, Roblox rolled out a few successful music events and also partnered with Netflix on testing long-form media consumption in the virtual world. Apple in its iOS 14.5 rolled out an impactful change for the digital advertising landscape by requiring all apps to ask users to “opt in”.

Initially, six of CSCO’s most popular meeting devices, like Cisco Room Bar, Board Pro, Cisco Room Kit Pro will be certified by Microsoft Teams, followed by Cisco Desk Pro and Cisco Room navigator.Cisco has formed this partnership with Microsoft to benefit from the growing market demand for a hybrid work environment. Microsoft Teams is experiencing growing usage, which will help Cisco expand its customer base in the enterprise communication space. Per Industry Research data, the enterprise market is expected to witness a CAGR of 17.3% between 2022 and 2028.The recent partnership with Microsoft is amongst its various strategic alliances with global tech companies, which will help Cisco to address growing global trends.Cisco Systems, Inc. Price and ConsensusCisco Systems, Inc. Price and ConsensusCisco Systems, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteStrategic Alliances Boost ProspectsCisco’s shares have been negatively impacted by global supply chain challenges. The supply chain constraints resulted in a severe shortage of certain components that hurt Cisco’s ability to ship products to customers, thus hindering the top-line growth in the last reported quarter.Cisco’s top line growth was also impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war, which has put various business enterprises in the crosshairs of geopolitical tension. Rising inflation is also a major headwind.Due to these reasons, Cisco has guided revenue growth for the first quarter of 2023 in the low single digits of 2% to 4% compared with the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $13.33 billion, suggesting growth of 3.33% from the year-ago period.Story continuesFurther, as it ventures into new markets, Cisco is experiencing stiff competition from the likes of Wipro Limited WIT in cloud securities solutions, Zoom and Slack in the hybrid work environment.Wipro recently expanded its collaboration with VMware to help customers move data to the cloud at a reduced cost and operate in a multi-cloud infrastructure.With the recent collaboration, Wipro FullStride cloud services will be able to provide its security services to customers for no additional cost and protect data while operating in a multi-cloud architecture. This is expected to help Wipro garner more customers amid rising competition.These reasons have contributed to the fall in Cisco’s share price. The stock has tumbled 35.9% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Computer - Networking industry’s decline of 37.6%.However, Cisco, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has inked alliances with most major technology companies globally to access new technology, develop innovative products, address megatrend markets and expand the total addressable market. The company has partnerships with Apple, IBM, Viacom, Telenor, Google and Alibaba and General Dynamics GD, which are expected to enhance the company’s business opportunities. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.One of its recent partnerships has been with General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), a business unit of GD, which is helping Cisco to maintain its position as the largest player in the networking space. The two companies have collaborated to deliver Cisco Private 5G services to various government enterprises for Internet of things (IoT) and edge use cases.Cisco’s strategic partnerships are helping it to address long-term megatrends such as hybrid cloud, hybrid work, security, IoT, 5G and Wi-Fi6.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Eli Lilly and Co. LLY, Visa Inc. V and Morgan Stanley MS.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Top Analyst Reports for Microsoft, Alphabet and Eli LillyThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Eli Lilly and Co. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft shares have held up relatively better compared to the software space (down -23.2% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s decline of -31.6%) and modestly worse than the broader market's -20.4% decline.Beyond some softening demand for the company's services over the near to medium-term as a result of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, Microsoft's business is as rock solid today as it was last year.The company’s increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space from Amazon is likely to dent margins. However, Microsoft’s performance is benefiting from strength in its Azure cloud platform amid accelerated global digital transformation.Teams’ user growth is gaining from continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of hybrid/flexible work models. Recovery in the advertising and job market boosted LinkedIn and Search revenues. Solid uptake of new Xbox consoles is aiding the gaming segment performance.Story continuesThe company is witnessing growth in the user base of its different applications including Microsoft 365 suite, Dynamics and Power Platform. Microsoft expects Surface revenues to grow in the mid-teens range, driven by strong demand for premium devices.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Alphabet shares have lost -32.3% of their value in the year-to-date period vs. -35.7% decline for the Zacks Internet Services industry and -25.5% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. A relatively subdued ad spending outlook given the macroeconomic headwinds is the biggest worry in the Alphabet story. But this is no more than a short to medium-term issue, as the long-term outlook for all of Alphabet's businesses, including digital advertising, remains favorable.The Zacks analysts believe for 2022, Google Cloud revenue to grow 24.7% from 2021. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results. Moreover, Google’s mobile search is gaining solid momentum. For 2022, we anticipate Google Search revenue to be up 11% from the last year.Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should continue aiding Alphabet’s business growth in the days ahead. Its deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Also, Alphabet’s expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. Considering the aforesaid factors, we expect 2022 total revenue to grow 10.3% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Eli Lilly shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+37.2% vs. +6.5%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz, and others. It is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals.Lilly expects to launch five new medicines by 2023 end including Mounjaro for type II diabetes (already launched) and donanemab for early Alzheimer's disease. Both drugs have multibillion dollar sales potential.However, generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States mainly on key drugs, Trulicity, and price cuts in some international markets like China, Japan and Europe are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have gone down slightly ahead of Q3 results.

However, some baristas are on board with the growing menu hack trend, sharing their own content online that tips coffee fans off on how to open up more or cheaper menu options.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: IBM’s former CEO downplays the importance of a college degree for six-figure earning ‘new collar’ jobsAmerican cities are preparing for the worstManaging Gen Z is like working with people from a ‘different country’‘Ridiculously stupid’ economic policies have the U.S. hurtling toward a ‘perfect storm’ of economic pain, Ray Dalio says]"

Momentum has continued at companies including Amazon.com Inc and Starbucks Corp and others.The workers, who call themselves the Penn Square Labor Alliance, sought to join the CWA to address concerns including fair compensation, career development and COVID-19 health and safety concerns.The NLRB did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.""The thing that really did it for us was seeing our peers at other Apple stores, our peers with Starbucks and other companies start to demand better for themselves,"" said Kevin Herrera, a part-time Apple specialist and one of the lead organizers at the Oklahoma City location.The CWA filed in early October an unfair labor practice charge alleging that Apple managers at the Oklahoma location informed workers that support for the union was futile, threatened to withhold benefits from workers supporting the union, engaged in unlawful surveillance and interrogated workers, according to a press release from the CWA.Apple declined to comment on the allegations.""We believe the open, direct and collaborative relationship we have with our valued team members is the best way to provide an excellent experience for our customers, and for our teams,"" Apple said in a statement.""We’re proud to provide our team members with strong compensation and exceptional benefits. Since 2018, we’ve increased our starting rates in the US by 45% and we’ve made many significant enhancements to our industry-leading benefits, including new educational and family support programs,"" the company added.Story continuesApple workers near Baltimore, Maryland, voted in June to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.The CWA in May withdrew an election petition on behalf of Apple workers in Atlanta, Georgia, claiming that Apple had repeatedly violated federal labor law and the rising number of COVID infections among store employees made a fair election impossible, according to the CWA.A regional NLRB office accused Apple on Sept. 30 of illegally attempting to stymie a union campaign at a New York City retail store by interrogating workers and barring them from leaving pro-union flyers in a break room.Some current and former Apple workers last year began criticizing the company's working conditions online, using the hashtag #AppleToo.Apple has 272 stores in the United States, according to the company's website.

75,26c04eaa-da0e-37f6-b1cc-eca28eda79a2,SBUX,2022-10-15,Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 70%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-corporation-nasdaq-sbux-favorite-140043618.html,1665756043,STORY,['SBUX'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 70% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Starbucks. Check out our latest analysis for Starbucks ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Starbucks?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Starbucks. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Starbucks' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Starbucks. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of StarbucksThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Starbucks Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$2.1b. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 28% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Starbucks is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those don't sit too well with us...If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

SAM is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 20. In the third quarter, the company is anticipated to have registered top and bottom-line growth from the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.38 per share, suggesting 13.8% growth from the year-earlier quarter's reported figure. The consensus mark has moved down 2.9% in the past seven days. For quarterly revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $571.9 million, suggesting a 1.8% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 18.5%. It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 63.9%, on average.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Boston Beer Company, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteBoston Beer’s robust brand portfolio and strategic initiatives are likely to have aided its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation, growth of non-beer categories and brand development is likely to have boosted its operational performance and its position in the market. Truly has been a key growth driver for Boston Beer.The company’s focus on innovation to revive the Truly brand and expand Twisted Tea’s potential bodes well. It is keen on bringing excitement to its core flavors through innovation. The company has been improving the Truly brand trends through a renewed focus on core business, smart brand innovation and strong distributor support and retail execution.Apart from the latest launches, the company announced the reformulation and improvement of core Truly flavors, including the addition of real fruit juice for an even smoother, easy-to-drink and refreshing taste. These efforts are likely to have contributed to top-line gains in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the Twisted Tea brand has been driving revenue growth for the past few quarters. It contributed to the majority of top-line growth in the second quarter. The Twisted Tea brand is likely to have delivered strong growth in the third quarter, backed by improved distribution and a unique product and brand positioning that resonates with more consumers.SAM’s commitment to the three-point growth plan — focused on reviving its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost-saving initiatives, and innovation — is expected to have contributed to the quarterly performance.The company is expected to have benefited from lower operating costs, including reduced advertising, promotional and selling expenses, driven by lower brand investments, particularly in media and production.Nonetheless, Boston Beer has been witnessing a dismal earnings trend in the past year, driven by the ongoing impacts of the slowdown in the hard seltzer business and supply-chain headwinds. Revenues have been impacted by lower production and shipment volumes due to the slowdown in growth trends for the hard seltzer category in recent quarters.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management anticipated the slowed hard seltzer sales to continue to impact Truly’s performance through the rest of 2022.Further, indirect volume adjustment costs due to the hard seltzer slowdown and higher material costs have been hurting margins. The persistence of these trends is likely to have weighed on the company’s top and bottom lines in the to-be-reported quarter. Boston Beer is expected to have been impacted by a decline in shipments in the Truly Hard Seltzer, Twisted Tea, Angry Orchard and Dogfish Head brands.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Boston Beer this time around.

The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Synopsys is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Cadence Design Systems has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

That’s because the beverage industry is a part of consumer staples, which are always in demand and usually the last to feel the heat of an economic downturn.The Upheaval in the Beverage Industry The beverage industry has an enormous growth potential given the constant upheavals and changing trends. Several reports suggest that consumers now prefer healthy beverages over sugary sodas and traditional drinks. A report by Grand View Research estimates that the global reduced sugar food &amp; beverages market size in 2021 was $46.18 billion. This market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9% from 2022 to 2030. The major cause of this new trend is the rising awareness about obesity and diabetes, which are caused by sugary drinks and high-fructose beverages.This key industry development has caused the market to see a plethora of new players entering the space. Innovative startups with healthy beverage formulas are garnering eye-popping funding rounds and vowing to upend industry juggernauts like Keurig Dr Pepper Inc (NASDAQ:KDP), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Molson Coors Beverage Co Class B (NYSE:TAP) and Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST).Small, up-and-coming beverage companies like Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) and Glucose Health, Inc. (OTCPK:GLUC) are launching healthy drinks which also taste better, luring the young-adult demographic whose spending power is strong. A report from Pipecandy.com expects the beverage industry’s value to reach $1813 billion in 2022. The industry, according to the report, is still growing at a CAGR of 4%. Spurring this growth are important social factors like high disposable income, increasing urbanization and changing lifestyles.  As the industry looks beyond traditional players and weighs new entrants, we decided to discuss some of the best small-cap beverage stocks in this article.Story continuesOur Methodology These companies have innovative products, long-term growth potential and interesting stories. We picked high-growth beverage companies having market caps between $8 million to $8 billion.

(NASDAQ:CELH) is a Florida-based beverage company that makes carbonated and non-carbonated functional energy drinks, liquid dietary supplements, flavored drinks and on-the-go drinkable packets and canisters. Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) is making waves as it vows to compete with industry leaders like Keurig Dr Pepper Inc (NASDAQ:KDP), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Molson Coors Beverage Co Class B (NYSE:TAP) and Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST) with its innovative drinks for various kinds of customers.Despite rising costs and supply-chain issues, the company is seeing a huge demand, which led to the company CEO John Fieldly deciding to significantly ramp-up inventory levels last year. Latest data shows that Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) saw a whopping 143% year-over-year rise in sales for four weeks ending July 16. Last month, Pepsi announced a $550 million investment in Celsius Holdings as part of a long-term distribution deal. Celsius Holdings, Inc.

The firm praised the company’s “premiumization strategy” and sustained category momentum initiatives and said the stock offers growth at a “reasonable valuation.” Wells Fargo has a $126 price target on MGP.

Duckhorn Portfolio Inc (NYSE:NAPA) sells luxury wines under several brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing, and Postmark.

(NYSE:PM) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Philip Morris InternationalIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, sold US$8.3m worth of shares at a price of US$111 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$85.26. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in Philip Morris International didn't buy any shares in the last year.

However, supply chain disruption might have had some impact on overall the bottom-line performance.Let's see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Aeronautics to Post Impressive SalesThe Aeronautics segment, which primarily manufactures advanced, combat-proven jets and comprises almost 40% of the company’s top line, is expected to have delivered impressive performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteStrength in the classified business area as well as higher F-35 deliveries are expected to have boosted the performance of the Aeronautics segment in the quarter. However, the supply chain might have had some impacts on this unit’s overall Q3 performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this unit’s revenues for the third quarter stands at $6,997 million, indicating a 6.5% rise from the prior-year reported figure.Impact of MFC &amp; RMS PerformanceLockheed Martin’s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) segment provides critical missile defense support to the United States and foreign allies. Higher volume from tactical and strike missiles must have boosted the sales performance of this unit in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, lower sustainment revenues for special operations, following the troop withdrawal, from Afghanistan might have had some adverse impact on the Q3 performance of the MFC unit.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MFC segment revenues is currently pegged at $2,844 million, implying a 2.3% increase from the year-ago reported figure.In its Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment, solid helicopter volume must have boosted this division’s Q3 performance.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the RMS segment’s third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $4,118 million, implying a 3.5% improvement from the year-ago reported figure.Q3 ExpectationsConsidering the aforementioned developments, the sales improvement expected in three major segments of Lockheed Martin may have benefited the company’s overall sales performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues stands at $16.79 billion, indicating a 4.7% increase from the year-earlier reported figure.While such impressive sales performance is expected to aid LMT’s Q3 results, factors like a one-time pension settlement charge, the impacts of the year-to-date mark-to-market adjustments along with costs related to the Lots 15 through 17 production contract might have had an adverse impact on its bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the defense giant’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, suggesting a slip of 0.9% from the prior-year reported number.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lockheed this time around.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.32 billion, up 1.71% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.65 per share and revenue of $5.23 billion.

88,4e8daec0-94fb-3692-8d99-e89a9d6e1098,HCA,2022-10-15,Analysts Estimate HCA Healthcare (HCA) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-hca-healthcare-hca-140002938.html,1665756002,STORY,"['HCA', 'THC']","[The market expects HCA Healthcare (HCA) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 21, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis hospital operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.9%.Revenues are expected to be $15.05 billion, down 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.67% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for HCA?For HCA, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.18%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that HCA will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that HCA would post earnings of $3.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.21, delivering a surprise of +14.71%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.HCA doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerTenet Healthcare (THC), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.28 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -35.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.8 billion, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Tenet has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.30%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Tenet will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PPG is set to release third-quarter 2022 results after the closing bell on Oct 19. The paint giant’s performance is expected to have been impacted by weak demand in Europe and China, raw material inflation and supply-chain disruptions. However, it is expected to have benefited from acquisitions, pricing actions and restructuring cost savings.PPG Industries’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of around 10%, on average. The company reported an earnings surprise of around 3.4% in the last reported quarter.Shares of the company have declined 30% in the past year compared with an 18.2% fall of the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What do the Estimates Say?PPG Industries expects its adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2022 to be 5-7% below the bottom end of its guidance range of $1.75-$2.00 that was earlier announced in July 2022.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PPG Industries’ revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $4,545 million, suggesting a year-over-year rise of around 4%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the Industrial Coatings unit is currently pegged at $1,788 million, calling for an increase of around 10.8% year over year. The consensus mark for revenues in the Performance Coatings segment is pegged at $2,805 million, indicating a roughly 1.7% year-over-year rise.Factors at PlayPPG Industries is expected to have faced sustained headwinds from raw material and logistics cost inflation in the third quarter. The company expects raw material cost inflation of mid-teen-percentage in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. It also expects elevated logistics costs and energy costs in the quarter. The company’s third-quarter performance is expected to have been affected by tightened supply-related disruptions, which are expected to have continued in the quarter. PPG Industries also likely to have faced headwinds from unfavorable currency translation, stemming from a strong appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus many foreign currencies.PPG Industries’ third-quarter sales are also likely to have been impacted by the weaker demand in Europe and China. The company recently said that its sales were impacted by the further weakening of demand in Europe in comparison with its forecast at the beginning of the third quarter. Demand recovery in China was also lower than expected on a sequential comparison basis due to the resumption of certain pandemic-related restrictions. The declines in sales volume were most pronounced in September.However, the company’s third-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from cost-cutting and restructuring measures. PPG Industries is executing significant restructuring actions, focusing on regions and end-use markets with the weakest business conditions. The company is also expected to have benefited from its efforts to raise selling prices.The company is also undertaking measures to grow business inorganically through value-creating acquisitions. Contributions from the acquisitions are expected to get reflected in its September-quarter performance. Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon buyouts are likely to have contributed to third-quarter sales.Story continues PPG Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PPG Industries, Inc.

Results from JPMorgan, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and of course Wells Fargo. David Ellison runs point on the Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund. David, market has seemed-- at least initially seems to like some of these big bank earnings. Do you think that enthusiasm is justified?DAVID ELLISON: Well, I think the stocks have been down a lot. So the fact that they're up a little bit tells me that the world didn't come to an end again. So I think the stocks have been really bad. And so the fact that they're rebounding is sort of a sigh of relief.I think generally, the fundamentals are good. I mean, obviously the margins expanded because rates are moving up. And they're a primary beneficiary of that. But what you're not seeing is any real credit deterioration. So you've had a massive move in rates. You've had a massive move in the market that has gone down, that's taken money away. Sentiment is not great on Wall Street. And yet you don't really see any movement in credit. So it's interesting to note how strong these banks are, even though we have this fear of recession and the end of the world that seems to be the talk every day.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I mean, the end of the world trade can, at least from what I've been told, only be right once. And you hope that we don't reach that point. But when you think about some of the activity even that we're seeing here on the day as well, David, as the markets have slipped back into negative territory there-- we had a moment ago, all three major averages in negative territory after beginning the day pretty strong in what seemed like would be another add-on to yesterday's momentum, even though it was a whipsaw day yesterday.As you kind of look into the rest of this quarter, what would you need to see in order to have some confidence that a bottom had been set in during this fourth quarter, going into what economists are expecting in a recession at the midpoint sometime 2023?Story continuesDAVID ELLISON: Well, my general broad thoughts are that we've had a pretty good move in rates. Two years ago, I think the two-year was like 15 basis points. And now it's 4% plus. So I think we're through the bulk of the rate increases, meaning we're not going to go to 8% or 10% on the three-month T-bill, at least that's my opinion.I think what we're heading into now is an earnings issue for all of the companies, not all of them, but enough of them. Obviously, the financials aren't seeing any earnings issues. There's concern that there will be, that rates will go up, credit will kick in, loan demand will decline. And I think it'll be interesting to see what happens in the next couple of weeks as the nonfinancials start to report and tell you what's happening away from the financial economy.Again, the banks came into this downturn very strong, very conservative. They haven't made-- they don't want to make bad loans. They've got plenty of capital. They're benefiting from the rise in rates in the NIM. So this group is not really indicative of what's happening out there in the marketplace yet.JULIE HYMAN: Well, there are some hints of it, right? If you look at this, David, in JPMorgan, for example, yes, net interest income doing fantastically. But if you take out net interest income, revenue actually didn't do as well. They're raising their provisions for credit losses. They're seeing a decline in lending already. How much worse do you think some of those indicators, even at the banks, are going to get worse?DAVID ELLISON: Well, I don't-- I guess as an investor in these stocks, to be completely honest, I am looking forward to credit troubles. I am looking forward to higher rates. I am looking forward to the market getting very concerned about the health of the banking industry because that's going to generate the opportunities for me to buy the better names and outperform on the way up. So that's the raw truth of what I do.I don't want what we have now to continue because I can't really compete with the other companies in the marketplace that grow, they create new products. We need cycles for this industry to really make money for investors.And my hope-- again, I've been doing this for 40 years. I'm hoping we have a downturn. I'm hoping we have a recession. I hope we have higher nonperformers. That creates lower stock prices that I can buy as the economy recovers, the Fed pivots, and all that stuff.JULIE HYMAN: OK, so David, tell us--DAVID ELLISON: [INAUDIBLE]JULIE HYMAN: So what are the better names then? What are the ones that you're looking to get cheaper? What are the ones you most excited about getting cheaper in this kind of tumultuous period?DAVID ELLISON: Well, the ones that are going to have credit problems. And I don't think the bigger companies are going to have that. They've just been too conservative. They're too liquid. So the smaller banks, the midtier banks, maybe not the real small ones, where they have made loans, the loan to deposits are higher, they don't have as much liquidity. If credit kicks in on a negative thing, then they'll hopefully go down a lot more, and I'll be able to buy them.But right now, there's no problems in the industry. And this is the frustrating part for an asset manager. If there's no problems, there's nothing to get better. There's no reason for the stocks to go up.So we need things to go wrong for this group to get really attractive. And right now, the first four or five companies that have reported, everything's great. Nonperformers are OK. Loan growth is OK. Yeah, they're reserving here and there. But they're just being super-conservative. And I would do the same thing.So we'll see what happens. But I think you'll see more issues with the economy in the nonfinancials for the next couple of months. I think the struggle, the real challenges in the world is not the financial system. It's away from the financial system.BRIAN SOZZI: David, Wells Fargo is a top 10 holding in the fund. Does that company frustrate you? They had a couple, I would argue, two good comeback quarters to kick off this year. They come out here this morning. I would argue expenses are still high. They announced a charge. The home business under pressure, autos under pressure. What do you make of that name?DAVID ELLISON: Well it's a-- again, it's a-- again, this is a large cap fund. So I'm not going to own a $2 billion bank. So you have to own something big. But this is a-- the valuation is reasonable. They've got a great historical franchise. They've had some management issues for the last four or five years, which have been very frustrating, not quite as bad as Citicorp. But certainly, they've had some struggles.And the valuation is just too cheap to ignore. And the embedded franchise value of those deposits is just too large and too powerful. And you're seeing the benefit of those deposit franchises now in higher net interest income.BRAD SMITH: Just while we have you here as well, David, there's an interesting tidbit within the consumer sentiment survey that had come out just a moment ago, and particularly as we think about the consumer and the higher end-- or higher net income consumer as well, if you see them start to be impacted to the same kind of detriment-- or maybe not the same detriment, but as they're citing here, negative influence on their personal finances the highest in five months-- what does that start to spell out more broadly about where consumer mindset in the economy is trending towards?DAVID ELLISON: Well, presumably, the Fed is doing-- or is making things happen the way it wants to have them happen, meaning they're slowing the economy down. And that's showing up in certain things. Obviously, stock prices are down. Home prices have stopped going up 2% a day.So I think the issue here is who's going to really feel it more? And I just don't believe that the large financial companies, the banks, are going to feel the real bite of this recession, at least not yet. It's going to be the other companies. It's going to be the companies that have reported.Even you look at Nike, and you look at-- those companies are going to hurt a lot more than the banks are. The banks, since 2008, have been in a box. They've been regulated. They've been forced to be liquid, forced to be conservative, forced to have tons of capital. And now that's paying dividends for them in a sense that they're not seeing the struggle.So you're not really seeing what's happening yet in the economy. And I think the financials are not a good example of that yet. And so I think the numbers you're seeing are going to impact the nonfinancials a lot more than the financial companies.BRIAN SOZZI: David Ellison, who runs point at the Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund, good to see you.

They view the actions as tacit support for the war in Ukraine by Schlumberger. Human rights groups are watching how the company responds to the concerns.Russian law requires companies to assist with delivering a summons to employees and to conduct a military registration if at least one of its employees is liable for service, according to advocacy group Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre, which tracks corporate performance on human rights issues.In April, Schlumberger Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch said the world's top energy services company was closely monitoring developments in Ukraine and at the time was ""hopeful for a quick cessation of hostilities."" Schlumberger suspended new investments and technology deployment in Russia, but unlike some of its peers and customers, decided to remain.""The local leadership team is managing an incredibly complex and difficult situation,"" a Schlumberger spokesperson said this week in an emailed statement, adding managers are obligated ""to comply with local laws and regulations, especially when failure to do so could create additional risk for our local employees.""Schlumberger leaves decision-making on Russia employment policies to local managers, the U.S.-based spokesperson said. International sanctions ""do not permit U.S. or E.U. persons to provide consultation or instructions on employment practices to Russia,"" the spokesperson said.Story continuesDEFERMENT REQUESTSRussian President Vladimir Putin last month issued a decree to add new troops to its military amid heavy troop casualties in Ukraine. The decree left the number of call-ups to be set by the defense ministry and led thousands of Russians to flee to avoid conscription.The Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre requested information from Schlumberger and other non-Russian companies with operations in the country on their handling of the mobilization. Schlumberger had not responded as of Thursday, the group said, but two of those that did - drug makers Roche Holding and Novo Nordisk - said they had requested military deferments for their employees.Roche, which employees over 800 people in Russia, said it had filed a request for exemptions from military service for its employees. It declined to comment on the draft status of any employee.Novo Nordisk also said it sought deferments through a pharmaceutical trade association and has not had any employees conscripted nor received any orders from authorities.A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment directly on the military mobilization. However, the spokesperson said companies should expect their operations ""to become increasingly difficult as conditions on the ground become less hospitable to western companies.""While Schlumberger would not say how many people it employs in Russia, people close to the matter said its Russia Business Unit employs more than 9,000 people, representing around 10% of the company's global workforce.Dozens of its Russian workers have left the country, according to an internal document viewed by Reuters.Schlumberger said its ""Russian management team is relentlessly working with clients and the government to evaluate all exemption opportunities for their employees within the existing legal framework.""The company has disclosed past contracts with Russian state oil producers Rosneft and Gazprom Neft, and with Exxon Mobil Corp for work in Russia. Exxon has written off its investment in Russia and is trying to exit.Schlumberger rivals Baker Hughes and Halliburton are selling or have sold their oilfield services units in Russia.Weatherford International, which in March said the oil services company placed a hold on shipments to Russia and suspended new investments there, also maintains a presence in the country. A spokesperson declined to comment on how it is dealing with the military mobilization.(By Liz Hampton in Denver; Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington, Nikolaj Skardsgaard in Copenhagen and John Revill in Zurich; Editing by Gary McWilliams and Marguerita Choy)]"

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, both Schlumberger and Core Laboratories are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.SLB currently has a forward P/E ratio of 21.88, while CLB has a forward P/E of 30.96. We also note that SLB has a PEG ratio of 0.56. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CLB currently has a PEG ratio of 0.76.Another notable valuation metric for SLB is its P/B ratio of 3.76. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CLB has a P/B of 4.47.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SLB's Value grade of B and CLB's Value grade of C.Both SLB and CLB are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that SLB is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

President Biden has suggested a review of the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is, of course, a longtime Washington ally. The move by the oil-producing group stands in direct conflict with Biden's goal of ensuring lower prices for US consumers. And this coming just weeks before the all-important midterms here.The US says the Saudis presented no market basis for the cuts. Let's get to Regina Mayor, KPMG's global head of Clients and Markets. Regina, good to talk to you today. Let's start on that comment that we got from President Biden saying there's no market basis. And yet, you look at where oil is trading right now. We're right back below the levels we were at when that OPEC-plus cuts decision was first made. So I mean, what does that suggest in terms of where the real fears are? At the end of the day, is it about a potential global recession and a significant pullback in demand?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think the market reacted to the headline of the figure of 2 million barrel per day cut when the reality is that OPEC is producing 3 and 1/2 million barrels per day lower than their stated production quotas. So I saw it more as just a realization, an acknowledgment of what's actually happening on the ground. The one thing that was important was the Saudis are starting to signal that they don't have spare capacity. But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw over the summer.Now, the price is coming back down to Earth because I think, as you mentioned before the break, the demand side pressures, or there's a lot of uncertainty. China's still not come back fully online. There's lots of concerns now about what COVID could do over the winter. We're worried about a recession. So I think that's brought the price back down. But we saw a nearly 20% jump in WTI just in the last two weeks. And now, I think it's coming back down to a more realistic price projection.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Specifically on the supply side, we had so many oil analysts come out on the back of that OPEC-plus decision saying essentially, look, despite this announcement of 2 million barrels cut a day, at the end of the day, most of these OPEC numbers do not meet their quotas. I mean, what's the realistic number we should be looking at in terms of how much comes offline as a result of this decision?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think the real number that I was looking at is about 800,000 barrels per day because I just looked at what the reductions were from Saudi, Kuwait, and the UAE. So those are parts of the world that do have spare capacity. And when I visit the region, you hear different things from the different executives. So that was what the real cut was. But the EIA is forecasting that the US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023.So I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have the supply that we need, especially if we face into a reduced demand environment. If we see a really severe winter, and we don't see the-- and we don't see the recession that folks are expecting-- we see demand continue to spike, then we're going to see a lot of upward pressure on price.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about where those prices could move. I mean, you pointed to some demand concerns there, especially coming out of China. We're all watching to see what kind of messaging comes from this party Congress over in China from President Xi specifically on the economy. But you said we're still talking about a tight supply here. So when you say upward pressure, how much more upside do you see going into the winter?REGINA MAYOR: I worry a lot about a potential big spike in the winter. If we have a really, really cold winter, that's where I think we could see prices back close to 100, maybe even in triple digits. But I'm hedging against that. I really think the prices are closer to where they should be. I've said WTI and Brent should be in the 80s. That was what OPEC-plus was trying to do is shore the price back up because they saw the market potentially overreacting to some of the demand concerns and not paying enough attention to the supply. So I think that's in part what drove their 2 million barrel per day headline cut, which is just making transparent to the rest of the world what was actually going on.AKIKO FUJITA: And Regina, I know you can't speak to specifically sort of the political environment in all of this. But it does feel like there are increasing lines being drawn geopolitically when you think about what happened between Saudi Arabia/Russia, OPEC, and the US. You know, you've got the Western European countries and pushing their sanctions as well against Russia. I mean, at the end of all of this, wherever that end may be, how is the oil market going to look? I mean, how fragmented do you think things could get?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think, Akiko, the thing that has always surprised me is there's four fundamentals of how countries and markets need to manage energy. And that first and foremost is energy security. Second is affordability. Third is reliability. Fourth is sustainability. No doubt, the climate agenda is huge, and we are facing a climate crisis. But the world was focusing more on number four.There's almost like a Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have the energy that you need and it's not affordable and it's not reliable, then governments and policymakers need to get very heavily involved. And so that's how I would characterize what we're seeing today is the realization-- your previous guest talked about the '70s. I'm a child of the '70s. I remember long gas lines during oil embargoes. We're relearning the lessons from decades ago. And hopefully, we do a better time this time around.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, a lot of people kind of drawing parallels looking back in time in history right now with so much going on. KPMG's global head of Clients &amp; Markets. Regina Mayor, good to have you on today.]"

With 82% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$2.4b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 34%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Schlumberger, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Schlumberger?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Schlumberger already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Schlumberger's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Schlumberger. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.6% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.7% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 6.3% of the company stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SchlumbergerWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Schlumberger Limited in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$139m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Schlumberger. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Schlumberger better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Schlumberger  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

99,318f2008-9ff8-33a7-a5f7-cd9dbc80cf8c,SLB,2022-10-15,Investors Heavily Search Schlumberger Limited (SLB): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-schlumberger-limited-130001160.html,1665752401,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +11.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.55 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +52.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +57.8%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.78 indicates a change of +37.8% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SLB _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $7.12 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.9%. The $27.25 billion and $31.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18.9% and +14.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $6.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.2%. EPS of $0.50 for the same period compares with $0.30 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.8%. The EPS surprise was +25%.Over the last four quarters, Schlumberger surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Micro-Cap Stocks To Invest In.Large-cap and mega-cap stocks have been hammered hard in 2022, amid rampant inflation, rising interest rates, and global supply chain woes. As of October 13, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 23.5% year-to-date, the Nasdaq composite is down 32.75% for the year, and the Dow has tanked about 18% since the beginning of 2022. Investors have become cautious of their trades and holdings and are constantly adjusting their portfolios to suit to the current volatile market environment. Overlooked areas of the stock market, namely small-cap, micro-cap, and nano-cap are being eyed by investors and analysts alike, as they are becoming a more attractive risk/reward investment choice.BofA Analyst Bullish on Small-Cap StocksHead of mid-cap strategy at Bank of America, Jill Carey Hall, recently appeared in an interview on CNBC where she made the case for why she thinks small-cap stocks may fare better than large-cap stocks in the current market environment and moving forward. Jill Carey Hall noted that there are multiple trends that favor the outperformance of small-caps relative to large-caps, one of which is ""services holding up better than goods"". Moving forward she sees these trends persisting and creating favorable conditions for the performance of small-caps. Here are some comments from Jill Carey Hall:""For small-caps, we have been pointing out how cheap they look, now they look even cheaper. As we think about the recession, small-caps are trading at 11x forward earnings. The ISM, the manufacturing index, has been a very correlated indicator with small-caps and a very important one for performance. When you look at what small-caps are pricing in, they are now discounting an ISM level of about 30, so that's pretty much the lowest the ISM has ever troughed if you look back at the 1970s early 80s recessions. The average for the last four recessions' ISM trough was more like 39, so we really think the index is pricing in a kind of worst-case scenario at this point in terms of recessionary multiples. And you have seen the index start to outperform even amid the weak market, so really small-caps have been doing well relative to large-caps, you know choppy but we think the outperformance may continue...""Story continuesJill Carey Hall also discussed some small-cap strategies. She noted that investors should ""stick with quality"" as ""quality tends to do well in volatile markets"". If the economy is thrown into a downturn, investors should be ""sticking with stocks within small-caps that have earnings rather than no earnings"". Finally, investors should ""stick with stocks that have free cash flows"" since it is a ""value strategy that tends to do well in these types of market environments,"" according to the analyst.Pixabay/Public DomainInvestors are steering away from large-caps such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), triggering major selloffs, and are redirecting their focus toward overlooked areas in the stock market such as small-caps and micro-caps.

President Biden has suggested a review of the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is, of course, a longtime Washington ally. The move by the oil-producing group stands in direct conflict with Biden's goal of ensuring lower prices for US consumers. And this coming just weeks before the all-important midterms here.The US says the Saudis presented no market basis for the cuts. Let's get to Regina Mayor, KPMG's global head of Clients and Markets. Regina, good to talk to you today. Let's start on that comment that we got from President Biden saying there's no market basis. And yet, you look at where oil is trading right now. We're right back below the levels we were at when that OPEC-plus cuts decision was first made. So I mean, what does that suggest in terms of where the real fears are? At the end of the day, is it about a potential global recession and a significant pullback in demand?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think the market reacted to the headline of the figure of 2 million barrel per day cut when the reality is that OPEC is producing 3 and 1/2 million barrels per day lower than their stated production quotas. So I saw it more as just a realization, an acknowledgment of what's actually happening on the ground. The one thing that was important was the Saudis are starting to signal that they don't have spare capacity. But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw over the summer.Now, the price is coming back down to Earth because I think, as you mentioned before the break, the demand side pressures, or there's a lot of uncertainty. China's still not come back fully online. There's lots of concerns now about what COVID could do over the winter. We're worried about a recession. So I think that's brought the price back down. But we saw a nearly 20% jump in WTI just in the last two weeks. And now, I think it's coming back down to a more realistic price projection.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Specifically on the supply side, we had so many oil analysts come out on the back of that OPEC-plus decision saying essentially, look, despite this announcement of 2 million barrels cut a day, at the end of the day, most of these OPEC numbers do not meet their quotas. I mean, what's the realistic number we should be looking at in terms of how much comes offline as a result of this decision?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think the real number that I was looking at is about 800,000 barrels per day because I just looked at what the reductions were from Saudi, Kuwait, and the UAE. So those are parts of the world that do have spare capacity. And when I visit the region, you hear different things from the different executives. So that was what the real cut was. But the EIA is forecasting that the US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023.So I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have the supply that we need, especially if we face into a reduced demand environment. If we see a really severe winter, and we don't see the-- and we don't see the recession that folks are expecting-- we see demand continue to spike, then we're going to see a lot of upward pressure on price.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about where those prices could move. I mean, you pointed to some demand concerns there, especially coming out of China. We're all watching to see what kind of messaging comes from this party Congress over in China from President Xi specifically on the economy. But you said we're still talking about a tight supply here. So when you say upward pressure, how much more upside do you see going into the winter?REGINA MAYOR: I worry a lot about a potential big spike in the winter. If we have a really, really cold winter, that's where I think we could see prices back close to 100, maybe even in triple digits. But I'm hedging against that. I really think the prices are closer to where they should be. I've said WTI and Brent should be in the 80s. That was what OPEC-plus was trying to do is shore the price back up because they saw the market potentially overreacting to some of the demand concerns and not paying enough attention to the supply. So I think that's in part what drove their 2 million barrel per day headline cut, which is just making transparent to the rest of the world what was actually going on.AKIKO FUJITA: And Regina, I know you can't speak to specifically sort of the political environment in all of this. But it does feel like there are increasing lines being drawn geopolitically when you think about what happened between Saudi Arabia/Russia, OPEC, and the US. You know, you've got the Western European countries and pushing their sanctions as well against Russia. I mean, at the end of all of this, wherever that end may be, how is the oil market going to look? I mean, how fragmented do you think things could get?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think, Akiko, the thing that has always surprised me is there's four fundamentals of how countries and markets need to manage energy. And that first and foremost is energy security. Second is affordability. Third is reliability. Fourth is sustainability. No doubt, the climate agenda is huge, and we are facing a climate crisis. But the world was focusing more on number four.There's almost like a Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have the energy that you need and it's not affordable and it's not reliable, then governments and policymakers need to get very heavily involved. And so that's how I would characterize what we're seeing today is the realization-- your previous guest talked about the '70s. I'm a child of the '70s. I remember long gas lines during oil embargoes. We're relearning the lessons from decades ago. And hopefully, we do a better time this time around.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, a lot of people kind of drawing parallels looking back in time in history right now with so much going on. KPMG's global head of Clients &amp; Markets. Regina Mayor, good to have you on today.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil refiner have returned +18.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Phillips 66 belongs, has gained 4.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $5.08 per share, indicating a change of +59.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.45 points to a change of +188.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.31 indicates a change of -31.3% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Phillips 66.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.78 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $154.82 billion and $133.88 billion estimates indicate +34.8% and -13.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $49.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +76.8%. EPS of $6.77 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.37 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +43.48%. The EPS surprise was +14.36%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The TJX Companies has been witnessing growth in its pre-tax profit margin for a while now. Management raised its guidance for the fiscal 2023 pre-tax profit margin on its last earnings call.However, it lowered its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance for the fiscal. For fiscal 2023, management envisions the adjusted EPS in the range of $3.05-3.13, lower than the earlier guidance range of $3.13-$3.20.

Further, with an increasing number of consumers resorting to online shopping, The TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business.We believe that The TJX Companies’ off-price model, along with its strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products, and efficient supply-chain management are likely to aid its performance.The TJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums have been adding growth. Management is sharpening marketing messages in outlets to emphasize value leadership to consumers.Further, the company is strategically targeting pockets of opportunity in specific geographies to boost messaging. The off-price retailer is on track to attract new shoppers of every age, including many Gen Z and millennial shoppers, to fuel growth.The TJX Companies’ second-quarter fiscal 2023 pre-tax profit margin came in at 9.2%, up from the 8.7% reported in the year-ago quarter.  The merchandise margin gained from the solid mark on and pricing initiative but was hurt by incremental freight pressure.The company now expects a fiscal 2023 pre-tax profit margin of 9.3-9.5% and an adjusted pre-tax profit margin of 9.7-9.9%. Earlier, management projected a pre-tax profit margin in the range of 9.2-9.4% and an adjusted pre-tax profit margin in the band of 9.6-9.8%.Story continuesDownsidesThe TJX Companies’ merchandise margin was hurt by incremental freight pressure in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company also witnessed incremental wage costs, which weighed on the pretax profit margin. The TJX Companies saw additional wage costs of 80 basis points (bps).The gross profit margin was 27.6% in the second quarter, down 1.8 percentage points. For fiscal 2023, management projects 140 bps of incremental freight expenses and higher wage costs of 70 bps.

(NYSE:TJX). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at TJX Companies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies What Is TJX Companies Worth?Good news, investors! TJX Companies is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $101.10, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. TJX Companies’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What kind of growth will TJX Companies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 36% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for TJX Companies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since TJX is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TJX for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy TJX. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

We saw the power of this brand and this huge need, and that in America, there isn’t an experiential toy store. When you look at some of our competitors, either they’re online or in the mass channel, it’s not an experience.” Walmart and Target are the two biggest sellers of toys in the U.S.Story continuesToys “R” Us at Macy’s Herald Square.

I didn’t know there was so many toys in the world.“Our mission since WHP acquired the brand, not that long ago, was very simple. We wanted to rescue the Toys “R” Us brand and bring it back to all Americans,” Shmidman continued. “When we approached Macy’s when we bought the business, Jeff and his team had the vision immediately. It was very organic and very fast. This is a landmark partnership with Macy’s.”It’s also a near exclusive arrangement with Macy’s, considering Toys “R” Us has one two-level, 20,000-square-foot store in American Dream, the mega entertainment and retail complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It’s possible WHP will open other stand-alone Toys “R” stores in the U.S. Abroad, Toys “R” Us has about 1,000 locations in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Australia and South Africa.Nata Dvir, Geoffrey the Giraffe, Yehuda Shmidman and Jeff Gennette, at the Toys “R” Us grand opening at Macy’s Herald Square.

They've fallen to $3.91 a gallon as of Thursday, according to data from the American Automobile Association – but started rising again for the first time in 99 days last month.The White House has repeatedly emphasized falling prices at the pump, which have brought much-needed relief to American drivers at a time when inflation is running red-hot.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Biden pushed for OPEC+ members to raise their crude production levels in a bid to keep gas prices low. But the cartel – which counts Russia and Saudi Arabia among its most prominent members – instead voted to cut its output by around 2 million barrels a day.That could push prices at the pump higher on the east and south coasts, as well as in the northeast and the Rockies, GasBuddy strategist Patrick DeHaan said last week.China and semiconductorsBiden has also cracked down on China ahead of the midterms.His administration introduced export controls last week that will limit the sales of semiconductors made with US technology to companies that have a special license.Chinese chip stocks plummeted after the announcement – while US-listed giants Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices also each slipped by over 1%.Story continuesThe Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks the 30 largest US chipmaker stocks, has slumped just under 44% this year – meaning it has significantly underperformed even the 25% loss suffered by the benchmark S&amp;P 500.Biden's export controls could fuel further sell-offs, analysts have warned.""It's as if the market is implying the last two years of semi growth were a mirage, engineered by central banks, and need to wiped clean,"" Bank of America said in a research note this week.Russian metal sanctionsDemocrats' next major policy move could be imposing further sanctions against Russia – as Biden looks to show he's cracking down on Moscow.The Biden administration is weighing up restricting imports of Russian aluminum, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.Having already banned imports of Russian oil and gas, that policy would aim to choke off another potential source of income for Russia and Vladimir Putin.Aluminum prices rallied 5.8% to $2,330 an ounce after Reuters reported the potential import ban, while the Dow Jones Aluminum Index spiked 7%.Read more: Biden shushes economists' recession warnings: 'Every six months they say this'Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The US now claiming Saudi Arabia pushed other OPEC+ nations to vote to cut oil production last week. Yahoo Finance senior columnist Rick Newman is here with the details. Rick, Saudi is looking to send a message to the United States?RICK NEWMAN: It seems that way. They are not doing the United States a favor here and they're being pretty overt around it-- about it. So let's recall President Biden did make a pilgrimage, if you will, to Saudi Arabia over the summer. This is after he called the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a pariah for orchestrating the murder of Jamal Khashoggi four years ago. So Biden basically went over to make amends and we know he did that because he wanted Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to get prices down and help with the economic war against Russia. So Saudi clearly has been behind this agreement by the OPEC+ nations, which includes Russia, by the way, to actually cut production rather than increase production. So now Biden says there will be consequences for this.The Saudi foreign ministry-- this was unusual-- they actually released a statement a couple of days ago saying, we push-- we're pushing back against these allegations that we're trying to help Russia out. These were purely for economic reasons that we want to cut production. And you've got a lot of members of Congress now, including some senators who run important committees, saying we need to do something like curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or find other ways to basically punish them for this decision. So it's getting ugly.- So then, Rick, in terms of actual leverage, obviously there tends to be a lot of rhetoric when these things come up. But in terms of what can actually be done, how much leverage does the US have, either on its own or if it teams up with allies on this?Story continuesRICK NEWMAN: The United States is a major arms supplier to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia needs those weapons because they have a militant foe right across the Arabian Gulf in Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are long, sworn enemies. And there has been kinetic military action between those two nations in the past. So they need American weaponry, including things like Patriot air defense missile batteries. So the United States could remove some US weapons that are there to help defend Saudi Arabia. They-- the United States could also decide not to sell Saudi Arabia weapons and, say, ""Well, why don't you go to your buddy Russia and get weapons from them?"" Of course, Russia is running out of weapons because they're firing all their own weapons at Ukraine. So that's one thing the United States could do.But it might backfire, in terms of the oil markets, because we are just going to be somewhat dependent on oil-producing nations, such as Saudi Arabia, because in those nations the government decides how much oil to produce. That is totally different from what happens here. The US government cannot go to Exxon or Chevron and say you need to increase oil production by 10% or 20%. And here in the United States, energy firms they do not want to invest in huge fossil fuel energy projects anymore because they don't think they're going to get their money back. They know this is a declining industry. The Saudi government on the other hand, can keep making those types of investments.So, in the future, I think governments like Saudi Arabia could be even more important to fossil fuel industries than they are now. So President Biden has to think about the long-term consequences of anything he's likely to do.- Certainly a delicate balancing act indeed. Thanks for breaking that down for us. Our very own Rick Newman. Have a good weekend.]"

That put the contract down for an eighth week in a row for the first time since February 2001. Major LNG outages include Berkshire Hathaway Energy's shutdown of its 0.8-billion-cubic-feet-per-day (bcfd) Cove Point LNG export plant in Maryland for about three weeks of planned maintenance on Oct. 1 and the continuing shutdown of Freeport LNG's 2.0-bcfd plant in Texas for unplanned work after an explosion on June 8. Freeport expects the facility to return to at least partial service in early to mid-November. There are at least three vessels heading to Freeport, according to Refinitiv data, including Prism Brilliance (expected to arrive Oct. 18), Prism Diversity (Oct. 27) and Seapeak Methane (Nov. 22), prompting some traders to believe Freeport will return in November. Others in the market, however, believe the plant's return will be delayed. Officials at Freeport said they remain on track to return the plant in November. Front-month gas futures fell 28.8 cents, or 4.3%, to settle at $6.453 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), close to the three-month low of $6.435 settles on Oct. 10 and Oct. 12. For the week, the contract was down about 4%, bringing its losses over eight weeks to around 35%. Despite the weeks of declines, U.S. futures were up still about 74% so far this year as soaring global gas prices feed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Gas was trading at $40 per mmBtu in Europe and $35 in Asia. That puts European forwards down about 8% and on track for their lowest close since June 28 as strong LNG imports have boosted the amount of gas in storage in countries in the northwest part of the continent to healthy levels above 90% of capacity. European prices hit an all-time high of $90.91 on Aug. 25. Russian gas exports via the three main lines into Germany - Nord Stream 1 (Russia-Germany), Yamal (Russia-Belarus-Poland-Germany) and the Russia-Ukraine-Slovakia-Czech Republic-Germany route - have averaged just 1.3 bcfd so far in October, the same as September but well below 9.2 bcfd seen in October 2021. TOP PRODUCER U.S. gas futures lag far behind global prices because the United States is the world's top producer with all the fuel it needs for domestic use, while capacity constraints and the Freeport outage prevent the country from exporting more LNG. Data provider Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 99.9 bcfd so far in October, up from a monthly record of 99.4 bcfd in September. Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would jump from 92.8 bcfd this week to 99.3 bcfd next week with the coming of colder weather before sliding to 97.2 bcfd in two weeks with the return of milder temperatures. The forecasts for this week and next week were higher than Refinitiv's outlook on Thursday. The average amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants fell to 10.9 bcfd so far in October from 11.5 bcfd in September. That compares with a monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March. The seven big U.S. export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG.

This company, which is in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.62%.For the most recent quarter, NextEra was expected to post earnings of $0.75 per share, but it reported $0.81 per share instead, representing a surprise of 8%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.69 per share, while it actually produced $0.74 per share, a surprise of 7.25%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor NextEra, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.NextEra currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.91%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 28, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.NextEra Energy Partners and Clearway Energy are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) right now. This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.NEP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.20, while CWEN has a forward P/E of 31.90. We also note that NEP has a PEG ratio of 1.52. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CWEN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.81.Another notable valuation metric for NEP is its P/B ratio of 0.48. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CWEN has a P/B of 1.53.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help NEP earn a Value grade of B, while CWEN has been given a Value grade of C.Both NEP and CWEN are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that NEP is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We expect China commerce and international commerce to be up 6.5% and 8.6% in fiscal 2023 year over year, respectively.Further, strength across the local consumer services, cloud computing business and Cainiao logistics services is contributing well to the top-line growth. Also, well-performing direct sales businesses like Alibaba Health and Freshippo remain tailwinds.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.NextEra Energy could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on NextEra Energy.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as NextEra Energy's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 18%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 25% in total over the last three years. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 38% each year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.6% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why NextEra Energy is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From NextEra Energy's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.We've established that NextEra Energy maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for NextEra Energy that you need to be mindful of.If you're unsure about the strength of NextEra Energy's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

In the third quarter, Value Investor Class returned -4.12% and Value Institutional Class returned – 4.09% compared to a -4.61% return for the Russell 2000 Value Index.

(NASDAQ:PDCO), a leading distributor of dental and animal health related products, reported first quarter results that included a sequential decline in dental equipment-related sales and price deflation in consumables.

With a healthy 4% dividend yield and attractive valuation, only 11X estimated earnings, we continue to hold Patterson.

(NASDAQ:PDCO) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.26 per share on the 4th of November. This means the annual payment is 3.9% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Patterson Companies Patterson Companies' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Patterson Companies' earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 14.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 46%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendPatterson Companies Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.48, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.04. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.0% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 2.6% per year. Patterson Companies is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. This isn't necessarily bad, but we wouldn't expect rapid dividend growth in the future.In SummaryIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Patterson Companies' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 3 warning signs for Patterson Companies you should be aware of, and 2 of them are concerning.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$12.2bUS$14.2bUS$15.9bUS$17.8bUS$19.2bUS$20.4bUS$21.4bUS$22.3bUS$23.1bUS$23.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.96%Est @ 6.17%Est @ 4.91%Est @ 4.03%Est @ 3.42%Est @ 2.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$11.4kUS$12.5kUS$13.1kUS$13.7kUS$13.9kUS$13.8kUS$13.6kUS$13.2kUS$12.8kUS$12.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$130bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$24b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$509bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$509b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$265bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$395b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$294, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mastercard as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.017. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

And while the delivery mechanisms could be many, a true metaverse experience is seen as one which will use VR headsets, sensors, and haptic feedback to completely immerse the user in a 3D world.While the metaverse is most commonly associated with gaming, it has the potential to transform and play a role in nearly every facet of our lives, from how we work and conduct business, to how we socialize, consume entertainment, and spend our money. Rudimentary examples of metaverses already exist, primarily in the form of gaming type experiences like Roblox (primarily because of the presence of live events on the platform, which other online games like Fortnite have also hosted) and Meta Platforms’ Horizon Worlds (a more focused, though early-stage attempt at a true metaverse experience).What differentiates a metaverse from a traditional online video game, which otherwise has many of the same elements, is the broad real-life applications that a metaverse could offer. Socializing, work, education, live events, or conducting metaverse-related business all figure to feature prominently in these worlds. Entire economies are expected to spring up within these worlds that will actually lead to real-world, but metaverse-based jobs, such as game designers, visual architects, and fashion designers, and virtual land owners (and landlords?).Story continuesWe’re already seeing some astounding prices being paid for virtual property in games like The Sandbox, where more than $1 million was spent on virtual land so those owners could digitally live near Snoop Dogg. As more and more celebrities and influencers start heading into the metaverse, these scenarios will continue to magnify, with people spending huge sums to live near celebrities and making large sums if they can get celebrities to endorse their metaverse clothing or other creations.It’s that kind of real-world imitating economic backdrop, and the ability to otherwise conduct actual real-world business through the platform that has prognosticators so excited about the growth potential and future scope of the metaverse, which could be worth trillions of dollars.While the extreme ends of that growth aren’t likely to be felt any time soon, as the technology simply isn’t there yet (and likely won’t be for many years to come) to create a truly immersive metaverse, the market is nonetheless expected to grow at a very impressive 39.4% CAGR through 2030.If you believe in the long-term growth potential of the metaverse and are looking for some stocks to invest in that should be among the leaders in the space, you’ve come to the right place. The following list of top metaverse stocks is based on the latest shareholder data from a collection of some of the best investors in the world.10 Stocks That Will Own the MetaversePhoto by mahdis mousavi on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe following metaverse stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 VR Stocks That Will Own the Metaverse10. Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 23 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are three names most likely to own the metaverse in the years and decades to come. Another company that will have a big role to play in the metavolution is Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U).With gaming and immersive graphical experiences being core to the metaverse experience, 3D development platforms like Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U)’s will be key to building the backbone and eye candy that will shape our digital futures. Unity is already making money from such endeavors, in addition to standard video games, pulling in $617 million in revenue in the first half of this year. The company is poised to merge with app monetization company ironSource, with a shareholder vote on the issue taking place on October 7. That should give the company and its content creators even more effective means of making money from their creations, be they meta-related or otherwise.Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) crashed to a new low in hedge fund ownership during Q2 following a 41% drop in the number of funds long the stock. Greg Eisner’s Engineers Gate Manager and Nehal Chopra’s Ratan Capital Group were some of the funds that sold out of Unity during the second quarter. Jim Davidson, Dave Roux, and Glenn Hutchins’ Silver Lake Partners has more than 10% exposure to Unity in its 13F portfolio, owning just under 35 million shares.The ClearBridge Investments All Cap Growth Strategy was buying shares of Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) during the first quarter, explaining why in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We took advantage of a correction in higher-multiple stocks early in the first quarter to purchase shares of Unity Software (NYSE:U), a leading platform to create, run and monetize 3D content. With about 1.6 million monthly active creators versus roughly 15 million potential content creators in gaming alone, we believe the company’s Create Engine is still underpenetrated relative to its core addressable market. We similarly see a long runway for growth in Unity’s Operate Solutions segment given its advertising network commands single-digit share of the $60 billion mobile app install ad market today. Furthermore, we believe Unity is well-positioned to expand its addressable market to include industries beyond gaming, on both the operate and create sides of their business (Exhibit 1). The company is not yet free cash flow positive but given strong net expansion rates and high gross margins, we see a path to improving profitability over time, with management notably targeting positive free cash flow this fiscal year.""9. Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26 Japanese electronics giant Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is one of the biggest players in the metaverse at this point given the traction that its PlayStation-based VR headset has achieved, selling over 4 million copies worldwide. Sony recently partnered with English Premier League club Manchester City to recreate that team’s football stadium in the metaverse. Sony also sells sensors and other imaging technology that could be utilized by other companies engaged in the development of metaverse experiences.26 of the hedge funds that are tracked by Insider Monkey’s database were long Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) on June 30, up 30% from three quarters earlier. Ben Jacobs’ Anomaly Capital Management initiated a position of 1.65 million Sony shares during Q2, giving its 13F portfolio 6.81% exposure to the company.Cooper Investors discussed Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY)’s role in the burgeoning music rights landscape in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“In recent years we have observed a growing market for music rights which represent another way for owners of record labels and music libraries like portfolio holdings Warner Music Group and Sony (via its subsidiary Sony Music, ~25% of our estimated enterprise value) to deploy capital, grow their businesses and create value for shareholders.In the first few days of 2022 Warner closed a deal to acquire David Bowie’s back catalogue for about US$250m which follows on from Bruce Springsteen’s catalogue sale to Sony for upwards of US$500m and Bob Dylan’s sale to Universal Music for a similar amount.The trend in demand for music copyrights is clearly strengthening, with competition for these assets coming from traditional music companies (Warner, Sony) as well as specialist investors and private equity…” (Click here to see the full text)8. Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 38 Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX)’s eponymous mobile game is one of the earliest examples of a metaverse in action, as the game features a collection of virtual worlds and activities created by millions of different content creators that can then be engaged with by players, a small number of whom exist within the environment at the same time and can interact with one another. Players can also buy fashion items and accessories for their avatars, allowing them to develop a unique look that sets them apart from other players’ avatars.In addition to the millions of standard game and hangout rooms, Roblox has also played host to several live events, including live concert experiences from renowned artists like The Chainsmokers. However, the limitations and annoyances of the Roblox platform can somewhat obscure the immense promise of what the metaverse could be, as you’re constantly bombarded with popup ads and gaudy in-experience ads trying to sell you stuff at all times. Despite that, Roblox had nearly 60 million daily active users in September, showing how popular shared virtual worlds not only could be, but already are.Hedge funds have bailed on Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) over the past two quarters, pushing ownership of the stock down by 38%. Some of the eponymous game’s biggest bulls were doubling down on the stock during Q2 however, as Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management, and Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Management all raised their stakes in the company. The three funds own more than $750 million in RBLX shares as of June 30.Jefferies Group discussed Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX)’s potential opportunities and pitfalls with its Metaverse game in the fund’s Q3 2021 investor letter:“If we look at the Metaverse concept with more lenient guidelines for interoperability, then it becomes easier to see why certain companies are being referred to as Metaverse. On the virtual side, we’d point to companies like Epic Games, TakeTwo and Roblox. In augmented reality, it would be Niantic and SNAP. These are the large capitalized players in the space but albeit, not the only ones. We expect new mulit-billion dollar companies will rise as theMetaverse becomes more mature.Roblox is a good example. The content is almost entirely user generated, the engine that powers the developer studio is provided by Roblox and developers/creators share in almost all the money that users spend on the platform. In addition, many of the items that you purchase in the avatar marketplace, or even a branded experience like Vans World, can be taken across experiences. Roblox talks a lot about platform extension, which would move the platform beyond just gaming/leisure experiences and into education and workplace offerings. The developer community has the capability to build tools for other developers, there are professional studios being built on the platform and many consumer-facing brands/content are partnering with Roblox to ensure a virtual presence. Roblox actually has a lot of the pieces for our utopian definition of Metaverse, but things like technology, interoperability with outside platforms and a dynamic, two-way economy are what’s missing. However, given our thesis that full interoperability is somewhat unrealistic, it’s easy to see how Roblox fits the definition…Many already consider RBLX a Metaverse, or at least an early iteration of one, and here’s why. The platform offers all the tools required for content creation in a low-code / no code format and handles publication, language translations, billing, collections, safety and security of the environment and more. It’s hard to find a platform that makes the creative process easier for developers than Roblox; we see this as very supportive of creator economy.The content is almost entirely user generated and developers/creators share in almost all the money that users spend on the platform. The developer community has the capability to build tools for other developers, there are professional studios being built on the platform and many consumer-facing brands/content are partnering with Roblox to ensure a virtual presence. Roblox talks a lot about platform extension, which would move the platform beyond just gaming/leisure experiences and into education and workplace offerings. Lastly, many of the items that you purchase in the avatar marketplace, or even a branded experience like Vans World, can be taken across experiences. In essence, the RBLX ecosystem includes creator economy, a virtual platform, picks and shovels of the Metaverse and some interoperability – many of the key enablers for Metaverse.However, there’s always work to be done. We would expect to see a more dynamic economy emerge with resale moving beyond limited items and premium members, particularly with newer gaming models such as play-to-earn. Increasingly, gamers are going to want some return for the time and money invested on a platform. Advancements in technology will allow for truly shared experiences among a larger and larger group of people. We remain skeptical on the reality of interoperability; RBLX could very well end up being one of many Metaverses.”7. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 66 Chipmaker Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will be another major player powering the metaverse in the future. Yet while the company is optimistic about its potential, it also believes we’re a long way away from true metaverse experiences, where thousands or even millions of people could all exist within the same shared world at the same time rather than being walled off into tiny instances of a world that support only a limited number of users.In an editorial posted to the company’s website, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) senior vice president and head of the company’s Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group, Raja Koduri, believes we’ll need to achieve a 1,000-fold increase in computing power before true metaverses will be possible.For its part, Intel is going all-in on chipmaking again, perhaps with an eye on owning the metaverse, as the company recently announced plans to spin off its autonomous driving unit Mobileye.Hedge fund ownership of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has fallen by 23% since peaking at the end of the first quarter of 2021, including one of its steepest drops in smart money ownership during Q2. David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and Rob Citrone’s Discovery Capital Management were two prominent hedge funds that sold out of Intel during the quarter.Baron Funds explained why Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has failed to perform like some of its dot-com era peers in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Then, there is the case of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”6. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 71Closing out the first half of the list is another chipmaker, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM). While the company is best known for powering many of the world’s mobile devices with its Snapdragon processors, it’s angling to be one of the leading players in the metaverse as well. The company recently partnered with Meta Platforms to build novel VR and AR experiences utilizing custom Snapdragon XR platforms.QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s venture capital arm has also deployed $100 million into a Metaverse fund to support the development of the metaverse ecosystem, specifically those that use the company’s XR platform. Those experiences won’t just be gaming-related, but will instead encompass everything from the health and wellness field, to education and entertainment.Hedge fund ownership of QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is also down by 23% from its peak, which was achieved in the third quarter of 2020. There’s also been a decline in smart money shareholders of QCOM during six of the past seven quarters. Michael Rockefeller and Karl Kroeker’s Woodline Partners and Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp are among the funds that sold off their Qualcomm holdings during Q2.The ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Value Strategy likes QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) opportunity to expand out from its strong mobile base, as outlined in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“Market strength continued in the fourth quarter, with only the communication services sector down in the Russell 1000 Value Index. Portfolio returns benefited from the strong performance of semiconductor maker Qualcomm, which has executed exceptionally well in pursuing the transition to 5G, growing both content and share due to its leadership position in cellular technology. The chipmaker recently outlined a number of peripheral growth opportunities outside of mobile markets, including automotive (where it hopes to leverage its strong presence in the automotive infotainment space into advanced driver assistance systems), Internet of Things (including opportunities in the PC market, VR/AR market, and factory automation) and radio frequency (where mmWave adoption globally, including China, would drive substantial upside).” Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be major metaverse players in the decades to come.

However, supply chain disruption might have had some impact on overall the bottom-line performance.Let's see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Aeronautics to Post Impressive SalesThe Aeronautics segment, which primarily manufactures advanced, combat-proven jets and comprises almost 40% of the company’s top line, is expected to have delivered impressive performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteStrength in the classified business area as well as higher F-35 deliveries are expected to have boosted the performance of the Aeronautics segment in the quarter. However, the supply chain might have had some impacts on this unit’s overall Q3 performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this unit’s revenues for the third quarter stands at $6,997 million, indicating a 6.5% rise from the prior-year reported figure.Impact of MFC &amp; RMS PerformanceLockheed Martin’s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) segment provides critical missile defense support to the United States and foreign allies. Higher volume from tactical and strike missiles must have boosted the sales performance of this unit in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, lower sustainment revenues for special operations, following the troop withdrawal, from Afghanistan might have had some adverse impact on the Q3 performance of the MFC unit.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MFC segment revenues is currently pegged at $2,844 million, implying a 2.3% increase from the year-ago reported figure.In its Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment, solid helicopter volume must have boosted this division’s Q3 performance.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the RMS segment’s third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $4,118 million, implying a 3.5% improvement from the year-ago reported figure.Q3 ExpectationsConsidering the aforementioned developments, the sales improvement expected in three major segments of Lockheed Martin may have benefited the company’s overall sales performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues stands at $16.79 billion, indicating a 4.7% increase from the year-earlier reported figure.While such impressive sales performance is expected to aid LMT’s Q3 results, factors like a one-time pension settlement charge, the impacts of the year-to-date mark-to-market adjustments along with costs related to the Lots 15 through 17 production contract might have had an adverse impact on its bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the defense giant’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, suggesting a slip of 0.9% from the prior-year reported number.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lockheed this time around.

Let’s take a closer look.Share Performance &amp; ValuationYear-to-date, JNJ shares have displayed remarkable relative strength, down just 2% and easily crushing the general market’s performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, over the last three months, the story has been a bit different; JNJ shares have declined 7%, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a fair margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, JNJ shares trade at respectable levels, further bolstered by its Style Score of a B for Value.The company’s 16.4X forward earnings multiple sits just a tick below its 16.8X five-year median, reflecting a 22% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly EstimatesAnalysts have been bearish for the quarter to be reported, with three downwards estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last several months. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $2.51 pencils in a nearly 4% drop in quarterly earnings Y/Y.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the company’s top-line is in better shape; the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate of $23.5 billion suggests a marginal 0.7% year-over-year uptick.Quarterly Performance &amp; Market ReactionsJNJ has a stellar earnings track record, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in each quarter dating all the way back to 2012. Just in its latest print, the company penciled in a slight 0.8% EPS beat.Story continuesTop-line results have left some to be desired as of late, with Johnson &amp; Johnson exceeding revenue estimates just once across its last four prints. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor those that like to trade around the company’s earnings releases, it’s worth noting that JNJ shares have moved upwards following five of its last six quarterly reports.Putting Everything TogetherJNJ shares have been remarkably defensive in 2022 but have lagged behind the general market over the last several months.Valuation multiples don’t appear stretched, with the company’s forward earnings multiple sitting just below its five-year median and nowhere near its Zacks Sector average.Analysts have been bearish in their earnings outlook, and estimates reflect a decline in earnings but an uptick in revenue – likely a reflection of margin compression.JNJ has consistently exceeded bottom-line estimates throughout its history, but top-line results have left some to be desired over its last four prints.Heading into the quarterly print, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an Earnings ESP Score of 1.3%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is worth considering Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry.This world's biggest maker of health care products has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 1.74%.For the most recent quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson was expected to post earnings of $2.57 per share, but it reported $2.59 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.78%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.60 per share, while it actually produced $2.67 per share, a surprise of 2.69%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Johnson &amp; Johnson lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Johnson &amp; Johnson currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.29%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 18, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Thus, to rein in inflation, which is at the 40-year high mark, the Federal Reserve is likely to opt for continued large interest-rate increases, thereby raising fears of recession and spurring market volatility. The energy sector is known for its volatile business scenario, and a slowdown in economic activities could significantly dent energy fuel demand.Companies belonging to the sector have been witnessing a choppy business environment since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Considering the backdrop, it would be wise for investors to bet on midstream stocks like DCP Midstream LP DCP, The Williams Companies Inc WMB and MPLX LP MPLX.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks belonging to midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, signifying considerably less exposure to both oil and gas price and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space. While one stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), two carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continues3 Stocks in the SpotlightDCP Midstream LP: DCP Midstream is a leading provider of midstream services, having a fully integrated and resilient business model. With 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, the master limited partnership has 2.8 billion cubic feet of daily natural gas pipeline capacity. DCP Midstream, with Zacks Rank of 2, strongly focuses on strengthening its balance sheet with the foremost priority of reducing debt load.MPLX LP: MPLX has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflows. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, #1 Ranked MPLX announced a repurchase authorization for an incremental $1 billion of units.The Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. With a Zacks Rank of 2 at present, WMB’s assets can meet 30% of the nation’s consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean-energy generation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop Grumman as its military aviation system offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aircraft market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects should benefit defense majors that have forayed into the military aircraft market. These include Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Textron TXT.Lockheed’s Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.

The segment also produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and V-22 Osprey.The long-term earnings growth rate of Boeing is pegged at 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA’s 2022 earnings suggests growth of 79% from the prior-year reported figure.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally known military aircraft preferred for training and attack missions.

Check out our latest analysis for Boeing Boeing Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Non-Executive Chairman Lawrence Kellner made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$209 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$132. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.1m for 5.48k shares. But they sold 990.00 shares for US$220k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Boeing insiders. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Boeing insiders own about US$56m worth of shares. That equates to 0.07% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Boeing Insiders?The fact that there have been no Boeing insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Overall we don't see anything to make us think Boeing insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Boeing and understanding this should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

As she puts it: ""I'm a data detective! I'm always asking, ‘What's different between these samples and why did it change?' Answering this teaches us how biology works and identifies warning signals that could help doctors and scientists understand, diagnose, or treat disease.""Illumina, Friday, October 14, 2022, Press release pictureRohrback was an early member of the team that developed the Illumina COVIDSeq™ Test, a high-throughput, sequencing-based, in vitro diagnostic workflow that enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2. ""Everything went from zero to 60 in an instant,"" she says. ""I've never been so hyper-focused or felt so purposeful and connected to so many coworkers across the globe-many of whom I'd never met. It was an utterly brutal, chaotic, and gratifying experience all at once."" Thanks in part to her work on COVIDSeq, Illumina received the first FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a sequencing-based COVID-19 diagnostic test.Another of her significant projects was developing a machine-learning model to classify cell-free RNA data from early-onset preeclampsia patients. ""It's very different from other RNA sequencing-there's information about your whole body that is really powerful, but any differences are subtle and noisy,"" she says. ""I spent my first few years at Illumina developing custom tools to reliably identify alterations. I remember getting goose bumps when I realized these changes not only linked back to many aspects of the underlying biology of preeclampsia but also could be used to tell apart patients from an independent study. It was a huge accomplishment I will be proud of for the rest of my career.""Story continuesThe COVIDSeq work notwithstanding, her projects are typically long term and can stretch on for years. ""For cell-free RNA, I wrote thousands of lines of code to figure out how to look for patterns in the data, and then I started to build the model itself,"" she says. ""It was a trek. But every little turn can get you a slightly better view until you reach the top. Every little step adds up to the final product.""Now in her fifth year at Illumina, Rohrback looks forward to solving more problems that will empower scientists and clinicians who use NGS. ""I get to put my energy into creating tools that contribute to making the world a happier, healthier, and more inclusive place.""Lightning RoundCollege major: BiochemistryPhD: Biomedical sciencesFun family factoid: ""I'm a third-generation PhD.""Hobbies: ""I love to learn how to make things! I knit, crochet, macramé, and have started woodworking. I have a large garden and make wine from our fruit trees. I make my own hot sauce, stock, pasta, and bread. And I love to go hiking if theweekend isn't too full.""Secret talent: ""Walking my cats on a leash.""Cats: 2Publications: 8What you've learned about yourself while working at Illumina: ""I recently started to take on project leader roles and almost immediately realized I am nothing without my team-and I find that extremely motivating. I have so much gratitude for getting to work with such talented and productive colleagues, and I love seeing how much we can accomplish when everyone comes together under a common purpose.""How often you work in the office: ""A few times a week. I love having the flexibility to choose which environment I need in order to be productive.""Best office accessory: ""Definitely the cat tree I built to go by my desk at home. Now I get feline company without having to sacrifice my keyboard.""What you bought with your last bonus: ""I used my most recent bonus to hire my wedding photographer.""Interview tip: ""I always ask scientist candidates to tell me about something that was hard to get working or a time when things didn't go according to plan. Research is a journey, and sometimes you're going to be wrong or run into problems. How you handle those situations tells me about who you are as a scientist.""One piece of advice for people who want to work in this field: ""Be open to new experiences, opportunities, and ideas.

162,5f329f8c-9216-3e1d-abca-abc79704698e,CI,2022-10-15,Is Cigna Corporation's (NYSE:CI) Stock's Recent Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-corporations-nyse-ci-stocks-110101209.html,1665831661,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna's (NYSE:CI) stock is up by 7.7% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Cigna's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Cigna How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna is:12% = US$5.5b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Cigna's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo begin with, Cigna seems to have a respectable ROE. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 15%, we aren't very excited. That being the case, the significant five-year 24% net income growth reported by Cigna comes as a pleasant surprise. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Cigna's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 18%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Cigna is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Cigna Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Cigna has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 0.3%, meaning that it has the remaining 100% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Cigna is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, Cigna is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 19% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Cigna is speculated to rise to 16% despite the anticipated increase in the payout ratio. There could probably be other factors that could be driving the future growth in the ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Cigna's performance. Specifically, we like that it has been reinvesting a high portion of its profits at a moderate rate of return, resulting in earnings expansion. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

A lot of damage has occurred, particularly in growth and technology stocks, as the Nasdaq has fallen over 33% from its November 2021 peak. Much has been discounted in the stock market in terms of the slowing growth that lies ahead.Will we encounter heavy selling on outsized volume, marking a capitulation meltdown as we’ve seen at previous troughs, or will it be more of a quiet bottom and slow, gliding trend back upward?The two big questions marks are inflation and the Fed. As we’ve seen with September’s inflation readings for both PPI and CPI, higher prices continue to linger despite the Fed’s thwarting attempts. However, certain inflation components appear to have peaked, potentially paving the way for the Fed to take its foot off the gas pedal.Despite a very difficult year for most stocks, we’ve seen pockets of strength in several different sectors such as energy and insurance. These pockets have illustrated resilience, and rather than succumb to higher inflation, they’ve actually benefitted from higher prices. We’re going to focus on the latter, which has held up very well this year.The Zacks Insurance – Multi Line is ranked in the top 31% out of approximately 250 industry groups. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.

The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive earnings surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks #3 rank or better and a positive earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Cigna’s ESP presently sits at +0.07%.

In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Cigna currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.07%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 3, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

166,6182df59-70cc-3655-802f-da74a01cd2da,CI,2022-10-15,"Cigna Corporation (CI) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-corporation-ci-soars-52-131501630.html,1665753301,STORY,['CI'],"[Have you been paying attention to shares of Cigna (CI)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 2.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $299.12 in the previous session. Cigna has gained 29.6% since the start of the year compared to the -19.7% move for the Zacks Finance sector and the -9.3% return for the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 4, 2022, Cigna reported EPS of $6.22 versus consensus estimate of $5.44 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.73%.For the current fiscal year, Cigna is expected to post earnings of $23 per share on $180.34 billion in revenues. This represents a 12.36% change in EPS on a 3.6% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $25.34 per share on $189.11 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.21% and 4.86%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCigna may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Cigna has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 12.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 9.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 10X versus its peer group's average of 6.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.16. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cigna currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cigna passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Cigna shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the third quarter, Mid Cap Value Investor Class returned -5.06% and Mid Cap Value Institutional Class returned -5.03% compared to a -4.93% return for the Russell Midcap Value Index. Initially, in the third quarter, the fund lagged behind its benchmark, the Russell Mid Cap Value Index. But at the end of the third quarter, the fund was able to close the gap compared to the benchmark index and outperformed year-to-date. Security selection contributed to the fund’s performance in the quarter. Financials and Utility sectors outperformed, while Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, and Energy sectors detracted from the performance. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2022.Heartland Advisors discussed stocks like Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) in the third quarter investor letter. Headquartered in Irvine, California, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) engages in the business of semiconductor products. On October 12, 2022, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) stock closed at $79.38 per share. One-month return of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) was -20.78% and its shares lost 50.46% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) has a market capitalization of $12.736 billion.Here is what Heartland Advisors specifically said about Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”jonas-svidras-e28-krnIVmo-unsplashStory continuesSkyworks Solutions, Inc.

The work will be carried out in Melbourne, FL.Importance of E-2D Advanced HawkeyeNorthrop’s E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft boasts battle management, theater air, missile defense and multiple sensor fusion capabilities in an airborne system. This offers the warfighter expanded battlespace awareness, especially in the area of information operations.Through its effective radar sensor and robust network-enabled capability, Advanced Hawkeye provides critical, actionable data to joint forces and first responders. Such features of the aircraft make it attractive for the military, thus resulting in NOC winning multiple orders for the same, like the latest one. The new orders are likely to boost the revenue-generation prospects of the company from the military aircraft business arena.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. To this end, a military aircraft that forms an integral part of any air defense system is likely to witness pent-up demand.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military aircraft market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% over the 2022-2031 period. Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop Grumman as its military aviation system offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aircraft market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects should benefit defense majors that have forayed into the military aircraft market.

Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$2.2m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Northrop GrummanIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, David Perry, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$394 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$501). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of David Perry's holding.In the last year Northrop Grumman insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Northrop Grumman better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Northrop Grumman Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Northrop Grumman insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$144m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Northrop Grumman Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Northrop Grumman, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Purchasing Nike products with the intentions of flipping them has already been prohibited by the sneaker company in its previous terms.According to Sole Retriever, the multinational corporation’s updated policy now states, “If NIKE determines that a purchase or order is intended for resale, NIKE reserves the right… to (1) suspend the application of any NIKE policy that provides a right or benefit intended for direct to consumer purchases.”Nike has reportedly kept the latest amendment to it’s Terms of Sale vague when determining who is solely purchasing products for resale purposes. Accounts that reflect excessive amounts of product returns or those exceeding product purchase limits can have their orders rejected by the company.The outlet provides part of the updated Nike policy with prohibitions referencing the use of bots. Part of the policy states, “Sale of products and fulfillment of all orders at a NIKE Store is subject to availability and our discretion in managing inventory. We explicitly reserve the right to limit, decline or reject any sales and orders for any reason without being liable for any damage or costs other than repayment of any amount received from you in relation to such sale or order…”CNBC reports that Nike took legal action against StockX, an online resale marketplace, earlier this year, alleging that counterfeit versions of the sneaker were being sold.

For one, Exxon Mobil has always operated on a generational time frame. The company is known for investing on a decades-long timescale and consistently puts capital to work when others are shying away. This contrarian streak showed itself, for example, when Exxon Mobil kept investing in its huge offshore Guyana field even as rivals slashed new oil and gas production spending. Once the price of oil surged again in 2021, the successful Guyana bet put Exxon Mobil in the driver’s seat among major international oil producers.Story continuesAll that to say that short-term regulatory developments during one congressional term aren’t enough to meaningfully slow Exxon Mobil down. Additionally, more regulation could lead to less output, and, in turn, higher prices. Further government efforts to restrict new oil and gas production could, counterintuitively, make Exxon Mobil’s existing production capacity even more valuable.In any case, XOM stock is a steal here trading at 9.3 times earnings with a current dividend yield of 3.3%.IBM (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAfter a decade of watching mega-cap technology stocks soar, it would have seemed crazy to think about buying IBM (NYSE:IBM). After all, the staid technology company seemed to have missed major technological trends and was struggling to maintain even flat revenue while the rest of the tech sector soared. With 2022’s turn of events, however, IBM’s appeal has returned.Simply put, IBM stock is so cheap that it doesn’t rely on future growth or high expectations. The company’s primary lines of business in providing tech consulting, information technology services and the like are not fast-moving, but they are consistent. IBM has established deep, persistent relationships, in many cases spanning decades, with leading Fortune 500 companies. These don’t go away overnight.IBM is far from dynamic at this point, but simply keeping the ship steady is enough with shares yielding 4.8%. Meanwhile, don’t discount future growth. The Red Hat acquisition greatly broadened IBM’s push into the hybrid cloud. Indeed, IBM’s cloud computing offering, while trailing the big three, has gained some traction with major customers in recent quarters.IBM has its issues, but those are fully reflected in its bargain valuation.Dividend Stocks for Passive Income: V.F. Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comV.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a large apparel company that owns more than a dozen different brands and trademarks, including Vans, The North Face, Dickies, Timberland and JanSport. V.F. covers a wide variety of demographics but is particularly focused on leisure and outdoor apparel.Investors may rightly shy away from apparel stocks given that this tends to be a cutthroat industry with thin profit margins subject to fickle consumer tastes. However, V.F.’s unique approach reduces this risk. The company’s large stable of different brands helps ensure that there is something that is always on-trend and gaining appeal with consumers at any given time. Right now, for example, while Vans is in a slump, The North Face products are selling well.VFC stock has lost 70% of its value since hitting its all-time high above $100 in early 2020. Profits have dipped a bit in 2022 as consumer spending has started to roll over and inventory levels have mounted. Regardless, the market has overreacted. V.F. Corporation has been through recessions before and can make it through this one as well.With its most recent dividend hike in October, V.F. Corporation left the Dividend Aristocrats and became a Dividend King — a company that has increased its annual payout for 5o or more consecutive years. VFC stock currently yields 7.6%.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) finds itself in a similar situation to Exxon Mobil, with some investors selling off shares thanks to the recent election results. However, long-term investors can profit from the political jitters. The truth is that profits for the major oil and gas producers with a global operations footprint simply aren’t that impacted by minor regulatory changes in the United States, at least not in the short run.Meanwhile, the world needs more energy. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a good deal of oil and natural gas supplies have gone off the market. This makes it much harder for continental Europe to power itself. Demand for liquified natural gas, or LNG, has soared to help ensure that the lights stay on and people stay warm during the harsh European winter.CVX stock is trading near its all-time high, which might make investors think they’ve missed the opportunity. Yet, shares still trade for less than 11.5 times forward earnings and offer a 3.2% dividend yield. And earnings should continue to grow thanks to strong energy demand along with the company’s share buyback program, which increases the amount of earnings per remaining outstanding share.Dividend Stocks for Passive Income: Clorox (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comClorox (NYSE:CLX) surprised a lot of investors over the past few years. Typically, people think of consumer staples stocks as being among the most consistent and least volatile. Yet, between November 2019 and August 2020, CLX stock soared as much as 66% as people rushed to stock up on cleaning supplies amid the early months of the pandemic.But it soon became clear people had way more bleach and other products than they could use in any reasonable time frame. This led to a slump in Clorox’s product sales as people simply haven’t needed to keep buying as many cleaning goods lately. Throw in inflation and supply chain issues and Clorox has gone from boom to bust in record time. Today, shares are once again trading at pre-pandemic levels.However, this downturn won’t last forever. Ultimately, sales of bleach and its other products will return to normal pre-pandemic levels and Clorox will get its profit margins back to typical levels. Meanwhile, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures will cool off sooner or later. And Clorox has been pushing through price hikes that will raise revenue considerably going forward.All told, investors can pick up this classic defensive blue-chip company at a discounted price thanks to the temporary earnings shortfall. And they can take comfort in the stock’s 3.4% yield while they wait.Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters’ main entrance.Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is a fellow consumer staples company that has faced a similar trajectory to Clorox. Kimberly-Clark’s outlook soared in 2020 as people raced to pick up additional toilet paper and bathroom supplies at the start of the pandemic. However, as the rate at which people use toilet paper, soap and other such essentials didn’t actually change much, this sales lift quickly disappeared. Throw in a major inflationary wave, and Kimberly-Clark’s earnings have come up short of expectations.But the company should have a swift road to recovery. When the cost of key inputs, such as wood pulp, stabilizes, it will put the company on better near-term footing. In the meantime, management continues to raise prices to offset the effect of higher costs.Analysts forecast the company’s earnings will decline 9% in 2022 to $5.62 per share, but the decline should be short-lived. As demand normalizes, earnings should come back quickly. Analysts predict a 12.6% earnings jump to $6.33 per share next year, which would result in a forward P/E ratio of 20.2 for this quality blue chip source of passive income. KMB stock currently yields 3.7%.Dividend Stocks for Passive Income: Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) has a compelling message for dividend stock investors: It labeled itself “The Monthly Dividend Company.” Realty has paid a monthly dividend since 1994 and is known for raising that payout amount several times each year.How does Realty Income manage to provide investors with a strong, consistent yield? It is a real estate investment trust and one specifically in the triple net lease category. These tend to be lower risk for landlords since the tenants are responsible for major expenses such as utilities.Like most other areas of the market, REITs have come under significant pressure in 2022. This is because they are tied to interest rates. Investors tend to demand a higher dividend yield from their REITs when the interest rates on comparable fixed-income alternatives such as government Treasury bonds increase. However, this is not a reflection of the quality of Realty Income’s business and has more to do with broader market conditions.In any case, Realty Income has increased its dividend for more than 25 years in a row, and it has good odds of making it through the current downturn without any major disruption in the business plan. Shares currently yield 4.7%.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in IBM, VFC, and XOM stock.

(NYSE:PFE) Hampers Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insufficient-growth-pfizer-inc-nyse-110028415.html,1665831628,STORY,['PFE'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 8.2x Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) may be sending bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 14x and even P/E's higher than 27x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Pfizer certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Pfizer will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The Low P/E?Pfizer's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 140% last year. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 138% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 14% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.5% growth per year, that's a disappointing outcome.In light of this, it's understandable that Pfizer's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Pfizer's P/E?It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.As we suspected, our examination of Pfizer's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Pfizer   you should know about.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Pfizer. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

Serious adverse events were rare and were not related to the vaccine.Post the announcement, Novavax shares were up 5.14% on Oct 13. However, shares of Novavax have declined 85.1% in the year-to-date period, compared with the industry’s decline of 25%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe CIC vaccine is a combination of Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine NVX-CoV2373 and its seasonal influenza vaccine candidate, previously called NanoFlu, in a single formulation.The safety and tolerability profile of the CIC vaccine candidate was consistent with the stand-alone NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (which induced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses) and the quadrivalent influenza vaccine candidate (which induced CD4+ T-cell responses) reference formulations.The positive results from the study provided important insights into the dose regimens, which can be utilized to progress the candidate in a phase II confirmation study. The company intends to initiate the phase II study by the end of 2022.Investors are reminded that Novavax had announced initial results from the phase I/II study of the CIC vaccine candidate back in April 2022, where the CIC vaccine exhibited the potential to reduce total COVID-19 and influenza antigen amount by up to 50% overall.Both the influenza vaccine and NVX-CoV2373 had previously demonstrated encouraging results in their separate phase III clinical studies.Previously, NVAX announced data from a pivotal phase III study evaluating the influenza vaccine, which demonstrated positive top-line results and achieved statistical significance for the key secondary endpoints.Story continuesNVX-CoV2373 is already authorized for use in more than 40 countries, including Australia, Canada, European countries and India. Novavax also continues to garner authorizations for the use of its COVID-19 vaccine with additional label expansions for younger populations and as booster doses.

PFE and its partner BioNTech BNTX announced positive preliminary data from a phase II/III study. The study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of their Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine.Data from the study showed that following seven days of dose administration in adults, a 30-µg dose of Pfizer/BioNTech’s Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine showed a substantial increase in antibody responses which were above pre-booster levels in adults aged 18 years and older. Comparatively, Pfizer/BioNTech’s monovalent vaccine generated more limited increases in antibody responses against the BA.4/BA.5 subvariants in older adults aged 55 years and above.The approved/authorized monovalent COVID-19 vaccines were not very effective against the BA.4/BA.5 subvariants. Though administering a primary vaccination regimen has reduced severe outcomes caused by COVID-19 variants, clinical studies have shown the antibody levels to wane over time. While booster doses of monovalent vaccines have restored these antibodies to their previous levels, this protection also weakens over time.The bivalent vaccine contains an mRNA encoding the spike protein in the original/monovalent vaccine and an mRNA encoding the spike protein common in the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants.Based on the above data, management suggests that the bivalent vaccine provides better protection against the BA.4/BA.5 subvariants than the monovalent vaccine in adults. The safety profile of the bivalent vaccine was also consistent with the monovalent vaccine.Shares of Pfizer have lost 27.2% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 5.1% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis August, the FDA granted EUA to Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s MRNA Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines for a single booster dose. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna booster vaccines can be given at least two months following primary or booster vaccination.While Moderna’s Omicron booster is authorized for adults aged 18 years and older, Pfizer/BioNTech’s version is approved for people 12 and older.Story continuesThe EUA was expanded earlier this week to include children as young as five years. Following the EUA expansion, a 10-µg dose of Pfizer/BioNTech’s bivalent vaccine is authorized for individuals aged between five and 11 years. A 25-µg and 50-µg dose of Moderna’s bivalent vaccine is authorized for children aged six to 11 years and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, respectively.The above authorizations granted to Pfizer and Moderna are based on clinical studies on their bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccines and pre-clinical data from studies on their Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccines. Unlike all previously-approved COVID-19 vaccines, the authorization granted to these booster shots is not supported by data from any human clinical studies demonstrating the vaccine’s effectiveness.Pfizer/BioNTech plans to present additional data from the phase II/III study in the coming weeks. Once this additional data is available, the same will be used by the companies to support its regulatory filings for the bivalent vaccine across different countries.

In adults aged 70-79 years vaccine efficacy was 93.8% while in adults with underlying comorbidities such as cardiorespiratory and endocrinometabolic conditions, vaccine efficacy was 94.6%. The vaccine’s efficacy against LRTD was also consistent across both RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes.Treatment with the vaccine was generally well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.GSK plans to file regulatory applications seeking approval of its RSV vaccine candidate for older adults in the second half of 2022.Shares of GSK have plunged 44.4% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s decrease of 27.3.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, there are no FDA-approved vaccines against RSV infections — a disease that leads to more than 420,000 hospitalizations and 29,000 deaths worldwide each year.A potential approval for the RSV vaccine for older adults will boost GSK’s vaccine portfolio as it may become the first FDA-approved vaccine for this patient population.

Merck and Moderna announced the exercise of an option by the former to jointly develop a messenger RNA (mRNA)-based cancer vaccine. GSK plc’s phase III study of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate for older adults met its primary endpoint.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMerck, Moderna to Jointly Develop Cancer Vaccine: Merck exercised its option to jointly develop and commercialize Moderna’s personalized cancer vaccine (PCV) mRNA-4157/V940, per terms of the companies’ existing collaboration agreement. At present, Moderna is conducting a phase II study to evaluate mRNA-4157/V940 in combination with Merck’s blockbuster cancer drug, Keytruda as an adjuvant treatment for patients with high-risk melanoma.Data from the study is expected to be reported in the fourth quarter. Per the terms of the companies’ existing collaboration agreement, Merck will make a payment of $250 million to Moderna to exercise its option for personalized cancer vaccines, including mRNA-4157/V940.FDA Grants Emergency Use for Pfizer &amp; Moderna’s BA.4/BA.5 Boosters for Kids: Pfizer/BioNTech announced that the FDA has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for a 10-µg booster dose of their bivalent BA.4/BA.5 Omicron-targeting COVID-19 vaccine for children aged five through 11 years.

202,18dc4d51-fb29-3aba-b142-d5af7be01c7b,IBM,2022-10-15,International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-corporation-ibm-130001104.html,1665752401,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.78 per share, indicating a change of -29.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.33 points to a change of +17.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.07 indicates a change of +8% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -22%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.9 billion and $61.16 billion estimates indicate -15.4% and +2.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $15.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17.1%. EPS of $2.31 for the same period compares with $2.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.12 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.75%. The EPS surprise was +0.87%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

203,70751bd7-b88f-3301-8a33-c6d8ec0135e8,MPC,2022-10-15,"Oil supply: The world is starting to get a ‘little more comfortable,’ analyst says",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/oil-supply-world-starting-little-153937505.html,1665761977,VIDEO,"['BZ=F', 'RB=F', 'VLO', 'BP', 'BPAQF', 'SLB', 'NG=F', 'PSX', 'MPC', 'HO=F', 'CL=F']","[KPMG Global Head of Clients &amp; Markets Regina Mayor joins Yahoo Finance Live to talk about the latest in oil markets, OPEC+ production cuts, and global recession fears.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, the fallout from the OPEC-plus decision to slash supplies continues. President Biden has suggested a review of the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is, of course, a longtime Washington ally. The move by the oil-producing group stands in direct conflict with Biden's goal of ensuring lower prices for US consumers. And this coming just weeks before the all-important midterms here.The US says the Saudis presented no market basis for the cuts. Let's get to Regina Mayor, KPMG's global head of Clients and Markets. Regina, good to talk to you today. Let's start on that comment that we got from President Biden saying there's no market basis. And yet, you look at where oil is trading right now. We're right back below the levels we were at when that OPEC-plus cuts decision was first made. So I mean, what does that suggest in terms of where the real fears are? At the end of the day, is it about a potential global recession and a significant pullback in demand?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think the market reacted to the headline of the figure of 2 million barrel per day cut when the reality is that OPEC is producing 3 and 1/2 million barrels per day lower than their stated production quotas. So I saw it more as just a realization, an acknowledgment of what's actually happening on the ground. The one thing that was important was the Saudis are starting to signal that they don't have spare capacity. But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw over the summer.Now, the price is coming back down to Earth because I think, as you mentioned before the break, the demand side pressures, or there's a lot of uncertainty. China's still not come back fully online. There's lots of concerns now about what COVID could do over the winter. We're worried about a recession. So I think that's brought the price back down. But we saw a nearly 20% jump in WTI just in the last two weeks. And now, I think it's coming back down to a more realistic price projection.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Specifically on the supply side, we had so many oil analysts come out on the back of that OPEC-plus decision saying essentially, look, despite this announcement of 2 million barrels cut a day, at the end of the day, most of these OPEC numbers do not meet their quotas. I mean, what's the realistic number we should be looking at in terms of how much comes offline as a result of this decision?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think the real number that I was looking at is about 800,000 barrels per day because I just looked at what the reductions were from Saudi, Kuwait, and the UAE. So those are parts of the world that do have spare capacity. And when I visit the region, you hear different things from the different executives. So that was what the real cut was. But the EIA is forecasting that the US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023.So I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have the supply that we need, especially if we face into a reduced demand environment. If we see a really severe winter, and we don't see the-- and we don't see the recession that folks are expecting-- we see demand continue to spike, then we're going to see a lot of upward pressure on price.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about where those prices could move. I mean, you pointed to some demand concerns there, especially coming out of China. We're all watching to see what kind of messaging comes from this party Congress over in China from President Xi specifically on the economy. But you said we're still talking about a tight supply here. So when you say upward pressure, how much more upside do you see going into the winter?REGINA MAYOR: I worry a lot about a potential big spike in the winter. If we have a really, really cold winter, that's where I think we could see prices back close to 100, maybe even in triple digits. But I'm hedging against that. I really think the prices are closer to where they should be. I've said WTI and Brent should be in the 80s. That was what OPEC-plus was trying to do is shore the price back up because they saw the market potentially overreacting to some of the demand concerns and not paying enough attention to the supply. So I think that's in part what drove their 2 million barrel per day headline cut, which is just making transparent to the rest of the world what was actually going on.AKIKO FUJITA: And Regina, I know you can't speak to specifically sort of the political environment in all of this. But it does feel like there are increasing lines being drawn geopolitically when you think about what happened between Saudi Arabia/Russia, OPEC, and the US. You know, you've got the Western European countries and pushing their sanctions as well against Russia. I mean, at the end of all of this, wherever that end may be, how is the oil market going to look? I mean, how fragmented do you think things could get?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think, Akiko, the thing that has always surprised me is there's four fundamentals of how countries and markets need to manage energy. And that first and foremost is energy security. Second is affordability. Third is reliability. Fourth is sustainability. No doubt, the climate agenda is huge, and we are facing a climate crisis. But the world was focusing more on number four.There's almost like a Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have the energy that you need and it's not affordable and it's not reliable, then governments and policymakers need to get very heavily involved. And so that's how I would characterize what we're seeing today is the realization-- your previous guest talked about the '70s. I'm a child of the '70s. I remember long gas lines during oil embargoes. We're relearning the lessons from decades ago. And hopefully, we do a better time this time around.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, a lot of people kind of drawing parallels looking back in time in history right now with so much going on. KPMG's global head of Clients &amp; Markets. Regina Mayor, good to have you on today.]"
204,0625040b-6185-303a-a3b4-7403784191b4,MPC,2022-10-15,Why You Should Buy Oil Service Provider Liberty Energy (LBRT),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-buy-oil-provider-liberty-132701667.html,1665754021,STORY,"['MPC', 'CHK', 'MUSA', '^GSPC', 'LBRT']","[Even as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 50% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 24%.Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.While oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Naturally, some stocks have been impressive since the start of the year. These also have strong earnings trends to back up their moves.One such company is Liberty Energy LBRT. Previously known as Liberty Oilfield Services, it is a premier provider of hydraulic fracturing and other auxiliary services to onshore exploration and production (E&amp;P) companies in North America. The Denver, CO-based independent, pure play operates in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Denver-Julesburg (“DJ”) Basin, the Williston Basin, the San Juan Basin, the Powder River Basin, the Haynesville Shale, the Oklahoma Scoop and Stack areas, the Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, and the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basins.Let’s discuss the reasons that make Liberty Energy an attractive pick:Solid Rank and VGM ScoreLiberty Energy is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock in the Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which carries a Zacks Industry Rank #34 — placing it in the top 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries. In addition to the favorable rank, LBRT enjoys a Zacks Value Style Score of B Growth of A, and an overall VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Story continuesEarnings Smash Estimtes in Q2LBRT posted excellent Q2 results on Jul 25, with EPS of 55 cents handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents and almost doubling from the year-earlier bottom line of 29 cents. The firm’s outperformance reflects the impact of strong execution, higher activity and increased service pricing, which more than offset rising costs. Total revenues came in at $942.6 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $875 million and 62.2% above the year-ago level of $581.3 million.Current Levels Are a Buying OpportunityAfter LBRT shares bottomed out (around $2.20) during the start of the pandemic, they have turned it around in style. Liberty Energy peaked in April at over $20 but has fallen to under $15 since then. Despite this drop, the stock is still up almost 54% on the year while the markets have gone lower.This powerful uptrend during a bear market indicates that investors should take advantage of the discounted levels and start looking at the name to see if it’s right for their portfolio. With the company experiencing the best market conditions in years, we believe that the LBRT stock has enough firepower left to keep chugging along. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Analyst Estimates RaisedPTEN’s earnings revisions have also trended in the right direction over the last 90 days, as analysts have consistently taken up their numbers. As a matter of fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Liberty Energy’s 2022 bottom line has jumped from a profit of 68 cents to a profit of $1.76 during this timeframe, while next year’s number is a rise from a profit of $1.59 per share to $2.73.Fundamental StrengthLiberty Energy offers hydraulic fracturing services to the onshore upstream energy companies across multiple basins in North America. With technological progress in shale oil production, increased rig efficiencies and higher well complexity, drillers of oil and gas wells require extensive solutions for mapping underground reservoirs. This translates into an ever-expanding domain of work for oilfield service companies like LBRT.The company already had a strong position in the oilfield service space, which has been further complemented by the OneStim acquisition. Apart from revenues and cost synergies, the transaction broadened Liberty’s geographic footprint by putting it into the Haynesville, Mid-Continent, and Canada. Further, the company added Schlumberger’s Permian frac sand business, plus pump down perforating wireline operations in the Marcellus and Utica.Bottom LineThe current scenario makes this a solid time to consider buying Liberty Energy. Yes, there are some apprehensions that the company may feel reverberating impacts from the inflation-triggered cost increases. But with crude demand set to remain robust and eventually surpass the pre-COVID record, most of the domestic fracking capacity is on the verge of being exhausted.In this context, Liberty management sees elevated demand for its reactivated fleet that supports clients’ long-term development plans. All these suggest strong long-term cash flows that should support higher price points for its shares.Other Energy Stocks to BuyAlong with Liberty Energy, investors interested in the energy sector might look at Chesapeake Energy CHK, Murphy USA MUSA and Marathon Petroleum MPC, each currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chesapeake Energy: Chesapeake is valued at some $12.3 billion.

205,fe37e79f-417f-3db5-9c16-492cf4d44698,MPC,2022-10-15,Marathon Petroleum and Ciena Corporation have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-ciena-corporation-highlighted-124912834.html,1665751752,STORY,"['MPC', 'CNA', 'MFC', 'UNM', 'CIEN']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 14, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Marathon Petroleum MPC as the Bull of the Day and Ciena Corporation CIEN asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CNA Financial Corp. CNA, Manulife Financial Corp. MFC and Unum Group UNM.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Marathon Petroleum, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has been a substantial beneficiary of the energy surge this year. The stock has gone on to rally to new all-time highs while the general market continues to hover in bear territory. With inflation stubbornly lingering as we’ve seen over the past few months, MPC is set to continue its dominant trend. MPC sports the highest-possible ‘A’ rating in each of our Zacks Value, Growth, and Momentum Style Score categories, indicating an increased likelihood that the stock continues to propel higher. The powerful combination of relative undervaluation and positive earnings estimate revisions should serve bullish MPC investors well into the future.Marathon Petroleum is a component of the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas – Refining and Marketing industry, which currently ranks in the top 1% out of approximately 250 industry groups. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Quantitative research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s future price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. By targeting stocks contained within leading industry groups, we can dramatically improve our odds of success.Company DescriptionMarathon Petroleum, headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, is engaged in refining, transporting and marketing of petroleum products. MPC also manufactures aromatics, propane, propylene, and sulfur. The company sells refined products to wholesale marketing customers in the United States and internationally.Story continuesMPC stores and distributes crude oil through pipelines, terminals, and barges. Furthermore, it gathers and transports natural gas liquids. Operating in 37 states, the District of Columbia, and Mexico, the energy giant was founded in 1887.Recent Earnings and Future EstimatesMPC has been on a hot streak in terms of earnings surprises, beating estimates in each of the past four quarters – with an average beat of 56.68%. Back in August, the company reported Q2 EPS of $10.61/share, a +15.7% surprise over the $9.17 consensus estimate. When a company is consistently exceeding estimates by this wide of a margin, it typically creates a ‘tailwind’ and boosts price momentum.Revenues for the second quarter of $54.2 billion also topped estimates by 63.08%. MPC has surpassed revenue estimates in each of the last four quarters.In the past 60 days, analysts have raised their Q3 EPS projections by +9.02%. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $6.89 per share, reflecting astounding growth of 843.84% relative to the same quarter last year.Charting the CourseMPC is up nearly 75% this year alone, widely outperforming the major indices. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to weather bear markets and corrections so gracefully. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. And as we know, MPC has seen a recent batch of positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and MPC continues to post earnings beats), the stock should continue its bullish run into next year.Other Factors to ConsiderMarathon Petroleum remains focused on enhancing shareholder value. The company currently pays a $2.23 (2.2%) dividend.In addition, MPC repurchased $4.1 billion worth of shares during Q2 and has now completed more than 80% of its target to buy back $15 billion in common stock.Bottom LineAs an established veteran in the industry, MPC trends remain favorable amid strength in the energy sector. Buoyed by an undervalued and leading industry group along with a maximum overall Zacks VGM score of ‘A,’ it’s not difficult to see why MPC is a compelling investment.A history of large earnings surprises along with a strong technical trend certainly warrant a closer look at this top-rated stock. Recent positive earnings estimate revisions should also serve to create a ‘floor’ in terms of any sudden or unexpected downside moves. If you’re looking for a way to diversify your portfolio, make sure to put MPC on your shortlist.Bear of the Day:Ciena Corporation is a global service provider that supports the routing, delivery, and management of video, data, and voice traffic on communications networks. The company offers hardware networking products, operating system software, multi-domain services and analytics. CIEN sells its products through direct and indirect sales channels to various network operators.The Zacks RundownCIEN, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Fiber Optics industry group, which ranks in the bottom 1% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This industry has underperformed the market at nearly every turn this year.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poor-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.CIEN experienced a climax top in December of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The share price is hitting a series of 52-week lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market continues its downward momentum into the fourth quarter.Recent Earnings Misses &amp; Deteriorating OutlookCIEN has fallen short of estimates in three of the last four quarters. The networking company most recently reported fiscal Q3 earnings last month of $0.33/share, missing the $0.35/share consensus EPS estimate by -5.71%. CIEN has posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of -3.57%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and CIEN is no exception.Ciena has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the fiscal fourth quarter, analysts have decreased estimates by 89.61% in the past 60 days. The Q4 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $0.08/share, reflecting a -90.59% regression relative to the same quarter last year.Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookAs illustrated below, CIEN is in a sustained downtrend. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears. Shares have fallen nearly 48% this year alone.While not the most accurate indicator, CIEN has also experienced what is known as a “death cross”, wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. CIEN would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock.Final ThoughtsA worsening fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to make its way back to new highs anytime soon. The fact that CIEN is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.Our Zacks Style Scores depict a weakening outlook for this stock, as CIEN is rated a worst-possible ‘F’ in our both our Growth and Value categories, paving the way for another ‘F’ in our overall VGM score. While this market remains quite difficult, it’s easy to understand why investors should steer clear of this poorly rated stock.Additional content:Economic uncertainty worsened in the first half of 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a tight monetary policy undertaken by the Federal Reserve and high inflation. In the past year, the S&amp;P 500 index has declined 20.4%. Volatility is expected to continue in the remainder of 2022.Amid this, insurance players like CNA Financial Corp., Manulife Financial Corp. and Unum Group are expected to brave industry headwinds. These have an impressive dividend history and are likely to yield promising returns. Dividends play an important role in limiting portfolio risk as well as market volatility. Regular dividend hikes also indicate profitability of the insurer.The insurance industry is benefiting from improved pricing, increased technology advancements, exposure growth and global expansion as well as an impressive solvency level. Prudent underwriting standards, lower mortality rates, redesigning and repricing of products and services and an improving rate environment should also add to the upside.Per the Global Insurance Market Index by Marsh, global commercial insurance prices increased 9% in the second quarter of 2022. This marked the 19th consecutive quarter in which composite pricing rose, continuing the longest run of increases since the inception of the index in 2012. Per Marsh, global property insurance pricing and casualty pricing increased 6% each on average in the second quarter of 2022.Pricing in financial and professional lines had the highest rate of increase across the major insurance product categories at 16%. Per Willis Towers Watson’s 2022 Insurance Marketplace Realities report, rates will continue to rise but by a small margin. Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte insights, global non-life premiums are estimated to grow 3.7% in 2022.Price hikes, operational strength, higher retention, strong renewal and the appointment of retail agents should help write higher premiums.With a rise in the aging population, the demand for retirement benefits is increasing. Per a report by IBISWorld, the $909 billion U.S. Life Insurance &amp; Annuities Market is expected to grow 2.5% in 2022. Increased vaccinations and economic growth potential instill confidence.The insurers remain exposed to catastrophe loss from natural disasters and weather-related events, which induce volatility in their underwriting results. Per Colorado State University (CSU), the 2022 above-average hurricane season may have 19 named storms, including nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes. This year’s hurricane season could be about 130% of the average season per CSU. Global estimated insured losses from natural catastrophes in the first half of 2022 were $35 billion, 22% above average of the past 10 years ($29 billion), per a report by Swiss Re Institute.Exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed declared the third consecutive 75 basis point increase in the Federal Funds rate. Currently, the interest rate is in the range of 3%-3.25%. Insurers, being direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are poised to gain. To check high levels of inflation, the Fed will continue to rise interest rates, which will improve investment results.Banking on operational efficiency, which leads to a solid capital position, insurers continue to engage in strategic mergers and acquisitions to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography and deploy capital to enhance shareholder value.Insurers have increased investment in emerging technologies in a bid to drive efficiency, enhance cybersecurity, upgrade policy administration and claims systems as well as expand automation capabilities across the organization. Deloitte’s Global survey projects insurers’ technology budget to increase 13.7% in 2022.Best 3 Dividend Stocks to WatchWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected three insurance stocks with a dividend yield of more than 2% and they have grown dividends over the past five years.

That’s because the beverage industry is a part of consumer staples, which are always in demand and usually the last to feel the heat of an economic downturn.The Upheaval in the Beverage Industry The beverage industry has an enormous growth potential given the constant upheavals and changing trends. Several reports suggest that consumers now prefer healthy beverages over sugary sodas and traditional drinks. A report by Grand View Research estimates that the global reduced sugar food &amp; beverages market size in 2021 was $46.18 billion. This market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9% from 2022 to 2030. The major cause of this new trend is the rising awareness about obesity and diabetes, which are caused by sugary drinks and high-fructose beverages.This key industry development has caused the market to see a plethora of new players entering the space. Innovative startups with healthy beverage formulas are garnering eye-popping funding rounds and vowing to upend industry juggernauts like Keurig Dr Pepper Inc (NASDAQ:KDP), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Molson Coors Beverage Co Class B (NYSE:TAP) and Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST).Small, up-and-coming beverage companies like Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) and Glucose Health, Inc. (OTCPK:GLUC) are launching healthy drinks which also taste better, luring the young-adult demographic whose spending power is strong. A report from Pipecandy.com expects the beverage industry’s value to reach $1813 billion in 2022. The industry, according to the report, is still growing at a CAGR of 4%. Spurring this growth are important social factors like high disposable income, increasing urbanization and changing lifestyles.  As the industry looks beyond traditional players and weighs new entrants, we decided to discuss some of the best small-cap beverage stocks in this article.Story continuesOur Methodology These companies have innovative products, long-term growth potential and interesting stories.

Latest data shows that Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) saw a whopping 143% year-over-year rise in sales for four weeks ending July 16. Last month, Pepsi announced a $550 million investment in Celsius Holdings as part of a long-term distribution deal. Celsius Holdings, Inc.

The firm praised the company’s “premiumization strategy” and sustained category momentum initiatives and said the stock offers growth at a “reasonable valuation.” Wells Fargo has a $126 price target on MGP.

209,366434eb-61d6-40d3-872a-2833b3b7bbee,GM,2022-10-15,Nikola founder Trevor Milton convicted of defrauding investors in e-truck startup,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-convicted-of-defrauding-investors-in-e-truck-startup-212527684.html,1665782946,STORY,"['NKLA', 'GM']","[Nikola (NKLA) founder Trevor Milton was found guilty of three counts of criminal fraud on Friday in a case accusing him of spreading lies about the electric truck startup for his own personal benefit.A federal jury in Manhattan found Milton, 40, guilty of two counts of wire fraud and one count of securities fraud, with the top charge carrying a prison sentence of up to 25 years, according to Bloomberg and other news reports. Milton pleaded not guilty to all of the government’s charges.Nikola gained notoriety in September 2020, when short seller Hindenburg Research alleged that the company had spun up an ""ocean of lies"" to deceive investors. Memorably, Hindenburg accused Nikola of releasing a deceptive video making it seem as if its Nikola One semi-truck were traveling under its own power at a high rate of speed when, in fact, it was just rolling down a hill.Trevor Milton, founder and former-CEO of Nikola Corp., exits the Manhattan Federal Courthouse following an appearance in New York City, U.S., July 29, 2021. REUTERS/Eduardo MunozMilton resigned from the company days after the Hindenburg report, and in July 2021, Manhattan prosecutors charged him with defrauding investors to drive up the value of his company's stock. Prosecutors say Milton lied about the capabilities of Nikola's trucks and fueling infrastructure between November 2019 and the month he stepped down.Nikola, founded in 2015, made its public debut on June 4, 2020, through a merger with VectoIQ Acquisition Corp (VTIQ), a special acquisition company formed by former General Motors (GM) employees.Prosecutors said Milton promoted the misleading video of the Nikola One semi-truck to make it appear as if it could drive on its own propulsion. He's also accused of lying about the existence of hydrogen fuel manufacturing and fueling facilities, as well as deceiving investors about the costs of hydrogen production. Milton also allegedly made false statements about its Badger pickup truck, truck orders, and battery technology.Milton tapped social media platforms including Twitter (TWTR) and YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL) to spread his lies, prosecutors said. That drummed up support for the company’s stock — especially from retail investors, according to prosecutors.Story continuesTrevor Milton, founder and former-CEO of Nikola Corp., departs the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in New York, U.S., September 12, 2022. REUTERS/Amr AlfikyThe deception turned Milton into a billionaire whose stock was worth $8.5 billion, according to prosecutors.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams tweeted on Friday that other would-be fraudsters should take note of Milton's conviction. ""Trevor Milton lied to Nikola’s investors — over and over and over again. That’s fraud, plain and simple, and this Office has no patience for it. Never has, never will. Let this case serve as a warning,"" he tweeted. ""Anyone who plays fast and loose with the truth to get investors to part with their money. It won’t end well.”Prior to the criminal case, Nikola agreed to pay $125 million in fines to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle charges that it misled investors about its products, technical advancements, and commercial prospects.The jury began deliberations on Friday after a nine-day delay due to COVID-19. In an email to Yahoo Finance Nikola stated that it was not commenting on Milton’s trial.However, in a statement issued at the time of Milton’s indictment, the company noted that the government’s actions against Milton were brought against him, individually, and not against the company.“The company has cooperated with the government throughout the course of its inquiry. We remain committed to our previously announced milestones and timelines and are focused on delivering Nikola Tre battery-electric trucks later this year from the company’s manufacturing facilities,” the statement said.Nikola, once worth north of $65 a share, was trading at roughly $3 at market close on Friday.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This Atlanta-based carrier reported lower-than-expected earnings per share due to high costs and Hurricane Ian–induced disruptions.American Airlines AAL was also in the news when its management upped the revenue growth forecast for the September quarter owing to strong air-travel demand. An expansion update from United Airlines UAL was also available in the past week.However, Latin American carrier Gol Linhas GOL expects to incur a loss in the third quarter due to high fuel costs even though air-travel demand remains strong. Another Latin American carrier Copa Holdings’ CPA traffic increased in September from the comparable period’s level in 2019 (pre-coronavirus), again reflecting upbeat air-travel demand.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1. Delta’s third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 42 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.51 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. DAL reported earnings of 30 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then. In the third quarter of 2022, total revenues increased more than 52% on a year-over-year basis. The same increased 11% from third-quarter 2019 actuals. The fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted revenue guidance is encouraging and expected to increase in the 5-9% band from the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals, driven by strength in domestic air-travel demand and fast-recovering international travel demand. While air-travel demand is very strong for leisure, business travel is also bouncing back. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected in the 9-11% range.2.  American Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects total revenues for third-quarter 2022 to rise approximately 13% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier expectation: increase 10-12%). Total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of unit revenue) is now anticipated to be 25% higher than the third-quarter 2019 reading (earlier estimate was a 20-24% rise). Driven by upbeat demand, the pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, is anticipated to be 4.5% compared with the 2-4% band expected earlier. The third-quarter operating margin (excluding net special items) is expected to be roughly 7%. The average fuel cost per gallon forecast is maintained in the $3.73-$3.78 range. However, the guidance for fuel gallons consumed is decreased to 1,031 million from 1,040 million.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. For the third quarter of 2022 (detailed results of which will be out on Oct 27), Gol Linhas anticipates EBITDA margin to be approximately 15% and the EBIT margin to be roughly 5%. GOL estimates an average fuel price per liter to be R$ 6.62. Management anticipates a loss per share of R$1.8, indicating a loss Per American Depositary Shares of 70 cents for the third quarter. Fuel unit costs are anticipated to grow almost 87% from the prior-year actuals, backed by an 89% increase in the average jet fuel price. Passenger unit revenues for the to-be-reported quarter are expected to increase roughly 45% from the year-ago reported figure, driven by upbeat domestic air-travel demand (mainly for leisure) and the gradual recovery in international travel.Reflecting bullish air-travel demand, GOL’s consolidated traffic in September increased 41.4% from the year-ago level. That story was covered in detail in the previous week’s write-up.4. In September 2022, Copa Holdings’ traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 3.5% to 1.75 billion from the comparable period’s level in 2019. Increased passenger volume led to this upside. To match upbeat demand, CPA is increasing capacity — measured in available seat miles (ASMs) — which inched up 1.2% from the 2019 level to 2 billion. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 200 basis points (bps) to 86.9% in the last month.5. United Airlines reportedly decided to add flights to Australian cities with the relaxation of COVID-related travel restrictions and the surge in air-travel demand. UAL plans to fly nonstop from San Francisco International Airport to Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney; from Los Angeles International Airport to Melbourne and Sydney; and from Houston to Sydney.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that all airline stocks, apart from Gol Linhas, have traded in the green over the five trading days. Gol’s forecast of a third-quarter loss might have induced the southward movement of the stock. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has inched up 0.4% to $52.88 over the past five trading days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 34.3%.What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors will keenly await the third-quarter 2022 results of United Airlines and American Airlines, scheduled to be out on Oct 18 and Oct 20, respectively. We expect strong air-travel demand to have aided the top-line performances of both UAL and AAL. However, high fuel costs are likely to have dented their bottom-line performances.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SpaceX's Starlink satellites have been a vital source of communication for Ukraine's military since they arrived last spring. SpaceX CEO-- Elon Musk, of course-- said earlier this month that the operation has cost SpaceX $80 million, and will exceed $100 million by the end of the year. But now he says his company cannot donate more Starlink terminals to Ukraine's army, or continue funding the ones it already has.It's asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill, which he says would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year. Could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine's southern Kherson region-- Vladimir Soldo-- told residents on Thursday to take their children and flee, a sign Moscow is losing its grip on the territory it claims to have annexed following shelling from Ukraine. Saldo saying on Telegram that the target that the missiles hit are hotels, residential houses, markets, and there are lots of civilians.The departure of civilians would be a blow to Russia, especially due to the area's strategic importance. United Airlines looking to boost its fleet of wide-body jets. The airline operator is studying offers for Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus's 8350. It's been in talks with the planemakers for months, according to ""Bloomberg."" CEO Scott Kirby told pilots at a Denver training session that the airline is planning a triple-digit order, with multiple wide-body models being considered. And shares of the cloud computing company Nutanix have been surging today.That's after reports the company could be seeing takeover interest from Bane Capital. Right now, it's uncertain what prospects actually exist for a deal, but the acquiring company would likely have to pay a big premium to Nutanix's nearly $6 billion market value. The shares up 24% right now, Brad.]"

PNC has reported third-quarter 2022 earnings per share, as adjusted (excluding integration costs related to the BBVA USA acquisition) of $3.78, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.66. Also, the bottom line increased 0.8% year over year.A rise in net interest income, driven by higher yields on interest-earning assets and loan growth, and a fall in expenses were tailwinds. However, a decline in fee income was concerning.Net income in the third quarter was $1.64 billion, higher than $1.49 billion in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve on NII, Expenses DeclineTotal revenues in the reported quarter were $5.55 billion, up 6.8% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.39 billion.Net interest income improved 21.8% from the year-ago quarter to $3.48 billion. The upswing is attributable to higher yields on interest-earning assets and loan growth, partially offset by higher funding costs. The net interest margin increased 55 basis points to 2.82%.Non-interest income fell 11.4% year over year to $2.07 billion on a decline in residential and commercial mortgage revenues, capital markets-related revenues, asset management and brokerage revenues and lending and deposit services.PNC Financial’s non-interest expenses totaled $3.28 billion, declining 9% from the year-ago figure. The decrease primarily resulted from lower integration expenses and a decline in variable compensation due to lower merger and acquisition advisory activity.The efficiency ratio was 59% compared with 69% in the year-ago quarter. A lower efficiency ratio indicates higher profitability.As of Sep 30, 2022, total loans grew 1% sequentially to $315.4 billion. However, total deposits decreased nearly 1% to $438.2 billion.Credit Quality MixedThe company reported the provision of credit losses of $241 million against the recapture of credit losses of $203 million in the year-earlier quarter. Net loan charge-offs were $119 million, up 47% year over year.Nonetheless, non-performing loans decreased 18.2% year over year to $2.07 billion. Also, the allowance for loan and lease losses declined 14.5% to $4.58 billion on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesCapital Position Weak, Profitability Ratios ImproveAs of Sep 30, 2022, the Basel III common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 9.3% compared with 10.3% as of Sep 30, 2021.Return on average assets and average common shareholders’ equity were 1.19% and 14.97%, respectively, compared with 1.06% and 10.95% witnessed in the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment ActivityIn the third quarter of 2022, PNC Financial returned $1.7 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares of $600 million and share repurchases amounting to $1.1 billion.Nearly 53% of the company’s 100-million share repurchase program was available for repurchase as of the third-quarter end.Our ViewpointPNC Financial gave an impressive performance in the third quarter, with expenses declining year over year. The company is well-poised to grow on the back of its diverse revenue mix. With the gradual rising rates, the company’s net interest income and margins are positioned to increase, which is encouraging.

(NYSE:PNC) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$183 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$153).

This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own.

It's great to see that PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$215m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At PNC Financial Services Group Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at Target's (NYSE:TGT) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Target is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$5.9b ÷ (US$52b - US$22b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).So, Target has an ROCE of 20%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Target roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Target compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Target Tell Us?In terms of Target's history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. The company has employed 22% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 20%. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If Target can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.On a side note, Target's current liabilities are still rather high at 43% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.Story continuesOur Take On Target's ROCEIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 188% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Target, we've discovered 4 warning signs that you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

230,550d6e81-e0ba-31b7-bd04-fefbf17ae492,TGT,2022-10-15,Investors Heavily Search Target Corporation (TGT): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-target-corporation-130001407.html,1665752401,STORY,['TGT'],"[Target (TGT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this retailer have returned -6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has lost 5.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Target is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of -30% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -40.4%. This estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.02 indicates a change of +48.8% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Target is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Target, the consensus sales estimate of $26.37 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.8%. The $109.8 billion and $113.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.6% and +3.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $0.39 for the same period compares with $3.64 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.47%. The EPS surprise was -45.07%.Over the last four quarters, Target surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He contends that investors are not responding to the market ""shift"" in a sufficient way to change their behavior.In the second quarter, Third Point 13.7%, compared to the S&amp;P 500’s 8.5% annualized return.

(NASDAQ:TMUS). Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”09. Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTZ)Third Point’s Stake Value: $99.158 MillionPercentage of Third Point’s 13F Portfolio: 2.34%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio (Non-GAAP) as of October 09: 4.08 Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTZ) was founded in 1918 and is based in Estero, Florida. Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTZ) operates as a vehicle rental company.

The analyst claims that after the Q2 results, his larger thesis for the exploration and production industry remains valid. According to Lovaglio, Antero Resources Corp (NYSE:AR) represents a reasonably attractive value when compared to the larger market because structural undersupply, driven by multi-year underinvestment, should continue to sustain higher than anticipated commodity prices and better than anticipated cash returns.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey during Q2, a total of 64 hedge funds were holding a stake in AnteroAntero Resources Corp (NYSE:AR). Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR)’s largest investor is Zach Schreiber’s Point State Capital which owns 4.2 million shares that are worth $129 million.

(NYSE:CVE), valued at $2.9 billion. Soroban Capital Partners is its largest shareholder, with ownership of 50.3 million shares valued at $957 million.Here is what L1 Capital specifically said about Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE)  in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“MEG Energy and Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE): We continue to remain positive on the outlook for Energy. While a potential U.S. recession would result in softer oil demand, we believe this would be more than outweighed by China re-opening over the coming year (which would see a major lift in car and air traffic). Oil supply continues to remain constrained with sustained declines in global inventories and OPEC+ remains unable to grow production significantly. With the sell-off in energy stocks, MEG and Cenovus are currently generating more than 20% of their market cap in cash flow with large dividends and share buybacks to come.Cenovus Energy (Long +14%) shares rallied driven by continued strong free cash flow generation, as well as being positioned to benefit from strong refining margins and downstream operations. The company recently announced a significant increase in dividends, which gives us greater confidence on the potential for a 100% return of free cash flow generation via dividends and buybacks from early CY23. Given the long-life nature of its oil sand assets and its low cost of production, we estimate the company is free cash flow break-even at an oil price of ~US$40/bbl. At present, oil prices are more than double this break-even point, implying considerable upside to consensus cash flow estimates (if prices remain near current levels). There are also additional value realisation catalysts with the company continuing to progress the de-gearing of its balance sheet via organic cash generation and asset sales.”06. CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX)Third Point’s Stake Value: $144.283 MillionPercentage of Third Point’s 13F Portfolio: 3.41%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63P/E Ratio (Non-GAAP) as of October 09: 15.31CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) was incorporated in 1978 and is situated in Jacksonville, Florida. CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), together with its subsidiaries, provides rail-based freight transportation services. As of October 9, the stock is down by 27.80% year-to-date. In the second quarter of 2022, CSX Corp. (NYSE:CSX) posted an EPS of $0.5, beating estimates of $0.47 by $0.03. Furthermore, in Q2 2022, the company reported total revenue of $3.82 billion. During Q2, 2022, CSX Corp. (NYSE:CSX) was found in 63 hedge funds' 13F portfolios. The company maintains one of the longest track records of dividend growth in the transport sector, extending to 17 years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share and has a yield of 1.50%, as of October 09.On September 30, while maintaining an Overweight rating on the shares, Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski cut his price target for CSX Corp. (NYSE:CSX) from $40 to $35. Labor agreements and weaker volume results this fall will put pressure on railroad margins in the short term, according to Oglenski, who forecasts ""less robust"" 2023 earnings. Although the analyst notes that railroad estimates will probably be revised downward throughout the Q3 reporting season, the valuation compression for many stocks is ""at least getting close to prior recessionary periods.""Clearbridge Investments mentioned CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) in their Q4 2021 investor letter. This is what they had to say:“On a regional basis, the U.S. and Canada was the top contributor to quarterly performance, of which U.S. rail operators CSX (NYSE:CSX) was among the lead performers. CSX (NYSE:CSX) is one of five leading North American rail companies, with over 21,000 miles of rail, covering 23 states and 40+ ports. CSX (NYSE:CSX) is engaged in the transportation of rail freight in the Southeast, East, and Midwest via interchange with other rail carriers, to and from the rest of the U.S. and Canada. CSX (NYSE:CSX) performed well during the quarter after the company beats market expectations on its third-quarter results. The beats were largely driven by strong pricing, which could be hitting record highs, and healthy commodity/coal volume driven by the current energy crisis.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Value Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Dairy Companies In the World11 Best Big Data Stocks To Invest In10 Best Ethanol Stocks To Invest InDisclosure: None. 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The company's annual revenue dropped by 80% in the 2020 fiscal year.However, the company has rebounded strongly since then. Per its latest earnings report, Royal Caribbean's revenue increased to $2.18 billion from just $50.9 million in the year-ago period. The company projects that its revenue will continue to grow in the forthcoming quarters as travel restrictions are lifted, and more people feel comfortable taking cruises again.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with RCL. Click here to check it out. RCL 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of RCLPeter Lynch Chart of RCLRoyal Caribbean is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for cruises and is poised for continued success in the future in my view. Sure, all cruise companies are seeing a demand recovery, but most had to take on such astronomical debt levels to survive that future growth will go towards creditors for quite a while. That's not the case for Royal Caribbean, especially when compared to its biggest rival, Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL).Investors might not bite before things get better for both the company and the global economy. The Federal Reserve is hawkish right now, and there are likely more rate hikes to come, which is dangerous for companies with high debt levels. The possibility of global recession means investors will likely move towards safer assets putting pressure on the stock in the short run. Nevertheless, I think a long-term recovery for Royal Caribbean is in the cards; here's why.Royal Caribbean is the best option in a battered sectorCruise line stocks may not be a wise investment at the moment because the industry is still recovering from the pandemic. The industry also has high levels of debt. This means that investors are getting lower returns than they would with other sectors as more of these companies' income goes towards debt repayment. In addition, the cruise industry is highly cyclical, so it is important to know the potential for the economy.Story continuesRoyal Caribbean has managed to stand out in the cruise industry amidst the uncertainty. The company has cultivated an excellent reputation despite being battered by hard times. It reported an over 4,000% revenue increase in the second quarter of 2022, bringing its entire global fleet back online following widespread damage during the pandemic. Despite this, operating costs remain high due to the challenges of inflation and rising energy prices, which were partly to blame for the second-quarter operating loss of $218.6 million.The global cruise company expects to be back in the black by the third quarter, which is astonishing. Royal Caribbean expects earnings will be between $0.05 and $0.25 per share and adjusted Ebitda will be between $700 million and $750 million.In the second quarter, Royal Caribbean was able to get a leg up on its biggest rival, Carnival, and other competitors by reporting a positive operating cash flow figure in its July-ended quarter. Carnival reported cash flow of -$344 million compared to Royal Caribbean's positive cash flow figure of $478.64 million. No company can maintain itself long-term with negative operating cash flow.Carnival reported $300 million in Ebitda in its September earnings report. While Royal Caribbean has not yet reported its third-quarter earnings, as mentioned above it forecasts significantly higher Ebitda of $700-$750 million. Although Royal Caribbean is not out of the woods as yet, these numbers are a step in the right direction.In addition, Royal Caribbean revealed that bookings are ahead of 2019 levels. The company also predicts that bookings for 2023 will be higher than ever before, reaching what it calls ""historical ranges."" The return of passengers means great news for investors who have waited two years for things to get back to normal.Royal Caribbean's debt continues to dominate discussionsRoyal Caribbean took on a lot of debt to finance its expansion in the early 2000s. Then it had to borrow more money to restructure its debt because of the pandemic. While Royal Caribbean has been working hard to reduce its debt load, it still has over $17.74 billion on its books.A positive is that most of the company's debt comes with fixed interest rates, making the impact of rising rates a little easier. Approximately 70% of the company's debt is tied to fixed interest rates.When discussing the financial health of Royal Caribbean, it is also important to understand the dynamics of the industry. When the pandemic hit, the cruise industry took out a lot of loans and sold ships to stay afloat. Hence, cruise companies are highly sensitive to a hawkish Federal Reserve. But a high amount of debt is not a Royal Caribbean-specific issue. We have to look at how it compares to industry peers.Since Carnival is Royal Caribbean's biggest competitor, I think it is the best reference point here. According to Truist, as of Sept. 1, Carnival has $35 billion in total debt on its books. That number is higher than the $25 billion in total debt owed by Royal Caribbean. This is promising because Royal Caribbean is bigger than Carnival.TakeawayI believe Royal Caribbean is the best performer in the battered cruise industry due to cash flows returning to positive territory and a slightly more favorable debt situation (though it's still far from ideal). Royal Caribbean has long been a favorite among cruise enthusiasts known for its luxurious accommodations and world-class service. However, the industry itself is still seen as risky.While the industry is starting to rebound, there are still concerns about its long-term prospects. One of the biggest risks facing the cruise industry is the possibility of a global recession. If consumer confidence falls and people start cutting back on discretionary spending, the demand for cruises will again plummet. Moreover, the industry is also grappling with rising interest rates and fuel costs. Due to these issues, the cruise industry remains risky. Investors should be cautious until these issues are resolved.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

And celebrate they do. Evergreen Week is like an employee-appreciation week - on steroids. By all accounts, Evergreen 2022 was one for the record books.From Austin to Raleigh, Miami to Indianapolis and every branch and office in between, teams dressed up in themed costumes, hosted parties and potlucks, took part in scavenger hunts, played cornhole and other games, competed in a virtual talent show and had a lot of fun together.For example, the Bluffton Parkway team in Bluffton, South Carolina, went retro with a ‘90s theme day and the Whittlesey Boulevard team in Columbus, Georgia had some fun with Dress Like Your Boss Day (and no one got fired!). As always, there was no shortage of snacks during the week, as shown by the St. Andrews team in Panama City, Florida, who proudly displayed their hearty Evergreen spread.In a video message to associates, President and CEO John Turner explained that ""Evergreen Week is a special time at Regions. It's an entire week devoted to celebrating you - our associates - and all our teams who work together every day to make Regions a great place to work."" Then he added, ""If you're new to Regions, you're in for a real treat.""He wasn't wrong.The theme for 2022 was Green Means Go! and a sense of excitement about the future showed in many of the activities. Raleigh North Park branch teams in Raleigh, North Carolina, decorated their offices using the theme, along with lots of Regions green. At the New Smyrna Main branch in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, associates enjoyed potluck lunches and dress-up days. The Sunset Place branch in Coral Gables, Florida, celebrated milestone work anniversaries and published daily shout-outs honoring associates' contributions to the team.During Evergreen week, associates were encouraged to let their individuality shine and celebrate the diversity of their teams. The Whittlesey Boulevard branch team in Columbus, Georgia, was inspired by the idea.Story continues""One of our teammates, Mohammed Nabil, is originally from Bangladesh,"" said Branch Manager David Heard. ""He had the opportunity to go back earlier this year and brought back gifts for the team, traditional attire from his native country. It was really special for us to share a part of his culture and we enjoyed learning about the clothing and the customs.""Remote and partially remote teams also joined in on the Evergreen festivities. The Human Resources Office of Associate Conduct team didn't let distance get in the way of their fun - they enjoyed their dress-up days by video conference. One of their favorites was Minion Monday, which included the slogan, Our Team is One in a Minion!Evergreen is all about showing appreciation for associates, but Regions teams also recognize that giving back to the community is an important part of our culture. Many associates take the opportunity to volunteer or do neighborhood clean-ups as a team.The Lakeland Canada Road branch team in Lakeland, Tennessee, held a Paint for Hope party in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness. Corporate Communications volunteered as a team at the Food Bank of Central Alabama and helped assemble hundreds of boxes of food to be shared with local families in need. The Greater Gulf Coast Tallahassee teams - and many of their family members - pitched in for a similar cause at the Second Annual Hunger Fight Community Outreach Event.The Legal team prepared and served meals as part of on-site community service, and also added a little friendly competition. The Birmingham, Alabama-based department divided themselves into two teams that went head-to-head to collect the most warm-clothing items, children's activities, and school supplies to support Community Kitchens of Birmingham, a family in need, and a Birmingham public elementary school. More than 1,000 items were collected, and winners will enjoy a pizza party and 364 days of bragging rights!All in all, Evergreen 2002 was a resounding success, and everyone agreed they came away re-energized and ready to serve our customers and communities.Ready to build your career at Regions?Associates are Regions' most valuable resource.

238,f4a89dc6-64b5-32bb-bd0d-b3b0b85b06b6,RF,2022-10-15,Earnings Preview: Regions Financial (RF) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-regions-financial-rf-140002809.html,1665756002,STORY,"['RF', 'RF-PC', 'FNB']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Regions Financial (RF) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis holding company for Regions Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.81 billion, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.41% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regions Financial?For Regions Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Regions Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Regions Financial would post earnings of $0.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.59, delivering a surprise of +11.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Regions Financial doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Southeast industry, F.N.B. (FNB) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $359.68 million, up 12% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for F.N.B. has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 3.26%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that F.N.B. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1,070 million, indicating a rise of 3.1% from the year-ago quarter’s actuals.In the last reported quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 9.2%. SNA has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.9%, on average.SnapOn Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  SnapOn Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseSnapOn Incorporated price-eps-surprise | SnapOn Incorporated Quote Key Factors to NoteSnap-on has been gaining from continued positive business momentum and contributions from its Value Creation plan. The company’s growth strategy focuses on three critical areas, enhancing the franchise network, improving relationships with repair shop owners and managers and expanding critical industries in emerging markets.It has been on track with its Rapid Continuous Improvement process and other cost-reduction initiatives. The RCI process is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs. Management has been boosting customer services and enhancing manufacturing and supply chain capabilities through the RCI initiatives and further investments. All the aforesaid factors should have contributed to the company’s top- and bottom-line performances in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Snap-on continues to reel under supply-chain headwinds, which is likely to have hurt third-quarter performance. Rising cost inflation, stemming from higher raw material expenses and increased transportation costs, is expected to have been concerning. Unfavorable foreign currency movement might also have acted as a deterrent.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Snap-on this time around.

The services will be available with a Wi-Fi 6 router, up to two mesh extenders, and professional installation.The 5 Gig plan will help users simultaneously upload and download files, regardless of the file size. The 8 Gig plan will offer low latency so that user can work online in near real time.Google Fiber subscribers living in Utah, Kansas City, and West Des Moines will be able to access the services from next month.The new high-speed service plans are expected to boost the adoption rate of Google Fiber in the days ahead.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. QuoteGrowing Google Fiber EffortsApart from the latest move, Google recently opened Google Fiber Kiosks at local malls in three US cities to cater to customer requirements faster.Google Fiber is shifting focus from Fiber TV to a free Chromecast with Google TV and paid streaming services, including YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo or Sling to expand its presence in the streaming space.With these initiatives, Google aims to serve customers better and continue gaining momentum among them.This in turn will aid the financial performance of Google’s parent Alphabet, helping it win investors’ confidence in the near term and the long haul.Shares of GOOGL have been down 31.6% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 37.9%.Competitive ScenarioGoogle, with its recent move, upped its ante against other companies, including Frontier Communications FYBR and Verizon Communications VZ, which are also making diligent efforts to gain traction among customers.Frontier which has lost 23.2% on a year-to-date basis, offers services to residential and business customers in fiber-optic and copper networks, including video, high-speed Internet, advanced voice and Frontier Secure digital protection solutions. FYBR’s recent announcement of offering network-wide 2 Gig fiber Internet service to customers remains noteworthy.Story continuesVerizon Communication’s subsidiary Verizon Fios is a fast Internet solution provider based on 100% fiber-optic network for fast and reliable connectivity. It offers up to 25 times faster uploading speed than cable due to low latency and the reliability of fiber. Further, VZ recently rolled out a tri-band router with Wi-Fi 6, providing the highest bandwidth so that the whole family can be connected at the same time.

257,e1caf9df-4fa5-3a46-9e14-46ada8640b10,VZ,2022-10-15,Verizon Communications (VZ) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-vz-expected-beat-140002194.html,1665756002,STORY,"['VZ', 'T-PC']","[The market expects Verizon Communications (VZ) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 21, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. cellphone carrier is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -9.2%.Revenues are expected to be $33.76 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.93% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Verizon?For Verizon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Verizon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Verizon would post earnings of $1.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.31, delivering a surprise of -2.24%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Verizon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Wireless National industry, AT&amp;T (T), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.61 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -29.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $29.82 billion, down 25.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for AT&amp;T has been revised 0.5% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.75%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AT&amp;T will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

261,9f607226-ca50-355e-b1df-6b893a6158a9,NVDA,2022-10-15,10 Stocks That Will Own the Metaverse,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-own-metaverse-213845086.html,1665783525,STORY,"['META', 'RBLX', 'U', 'INTC', 'QCOM', 'GOOGL', 'NVDA']","[In this article we present the list of 10 Stocks That Will Own the Metaverse. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Stocks That Will Own the Metaverse.Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are three companies the smart money is betting big on that should one day own the metaverse, which has the potential to be one of the most lucrative ventures in human history.There’s no simple way to define what the metaverse is or will be, but a broad definition could describe it as a collection of virtual worlds in which people interact with each other through avatars. And while the delivery mechanisms could be many, a true metaverse experience is seen as one which will use VR headsets, sensors, and haptic feedback to completely immerse the user in a 3D world.While the metaverse is most commonly associated with gaming, it has the potential to transform and play a role in nearly every facet of our lives, from how we work and conduct business, to how we socialize, consume entertainment, and spend our money. Rudimentary examples of metaverses already exist, primarily in the form of gaming type experiences like Roblox (primarily because of the presence of live events on the platform, which other online games like Fortnite have also hosted) and Meta Platforms’ Horizon Worlds (a more focused, though early-stage attempt at a true metaverse experience).What differentiates a metaverse from a traditional online video game, which otherwise has many of the same elements, is the broad real-life applications that a metaverse could offer. Socializing, work, education, live events, or conducting metaverse-related business all figure to feature prominently in these worlds. Entire economies are expected to spring up within these worlds that will actually lead to real-world, but metaverse-based jobs, such as game designers, visual architects, and fashion designers, and virtual land owners (and landlords?).Story continuesWe’re already seeing some astounding prices being paid for virtual property in games like The Sandbox, where more than $1 million was spent on virtual land so those owners could digitally live near Snoop Dogg. As more and more celebrities and influencers start heading into the metaverse, these scenarios will continue to magnify, with people spending huge sums to live near celebrities and making large sums if they can get celebrities to endorse their metaverse clothing or other creations.It’s that kind of real-world imitating economic backdrop, and the ability to otherwise conduct actual real-world business through the platform that has prognosticators so excited about the growth potential and future scope of the metaverse, which could be worth trillions of dollars.While the extreme ends of that growth aren’t likely to be felt any time soon, as the technology simply isn’t there yet (and likely won’t be for many years to come) to create a truly immersive metaverse, the market is nonetheless expected to grow at a very impressive 39.4% CAGR through 2030.If you believe in the long-term growth potential of the metaverse and are looking for some stocks to invest in that should be among the leaders in the space, you’ve come to the right place. The following list of top metaverse stocks is based on the latest shareholder data from a collection of some of the best investors in the world.10 Stocks That Will Own the MetaversePhoto by mahdis mousavi on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe following metaverse stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 VR Stocks That Will Own the Metaverse10. Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 23 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are three names most likely to own the metaverse in the years and decades to come. Another company that will have a big role to play in the metavolution is Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U).With gaming and immersive graphical experiences being core to the metaverse experience, 3D development platforms like Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U)’s will be key to building the backbone and eye candy that will shape our digital futures. Unity is already making money from such endeavors, in addition to standard video games, pulling in $617 million in revenue in the first half of this year. The company is poised to merge with app monetization company ironSource, with a shareholder vote on the issue taking place on October 7. That should give the company and its content creators even more effective means of making money from their creations, be they meta-related or otherwise.Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) crashed to a new low in hedge fund ownership during Q2 following a 41% drop in the number of funds long the stock. Greg Eisner’s Engineers Gate Manager and Nehal Chopra’s Ratan Capital Group were some of the funds that sold out of Unity during the second quarter. Jim Davidson, Dave Roux, and Glenn Hutchins’ Silver Lake Partners has more than 10% exposure to Unity in its 13F portfolio, owning just under 35 million shares.The ClearBridge Investments All Cap Growth Strategy was buying shares of Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) during the first quarter, explaining why in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We took advantage of a correction in higher-multiple stocks early in the first quarter to purchase shares of Unity Software (NYSE:U), a leading platform to create, run and monetize 3D content. With about 1.6 million monthly active creators versus roughly 15 million potential content creators in gaming alone, we believe the company’s Create Engine is still underpenetrated relative to its core addressable market. We similarly see a long runway for growth in Unity’s Operate Solutions segment given its advertising network commands single-digit share of the $60 billion mobile app install ad market today. Furthermore, we believe Unity is well-positioned to expand its addressable market to include industries beyond gaming, on both the operate and create sides of their business (Exhibit 1). The company is not yet free cash flow positive but given strong net expansion rates and high gross margins, we see a path to improving profitability over time, with management notably targeting positive free cash flow this fiscal year.""9. Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26 Japanese electronics giant Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is one of the biggest players in the metaverse at this point given the traction that its PlayStation-based VR headset has achieved, selling over 4 million copies worldwide. Sony recently partnered with English Premier League club Manchester City to recreate that team’s football stadium in the metaverse. Sony also sells sensors and other imaging technology that could be utilized by other companies engaged in the development of metaverse experiences.26 of the hedge funds that are tracked by Insider Monkey’s database were long Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) on June 30, up 30% from three quarters earlier. Ben Jacobs’ Anomaly Capital Management initiated a position of 1.65 million Sony shares during Q2, giving its 13F portfolio 6.81% exposure to the company.Cooper Investors discussed Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY)’s role in the burgeoning music rights landscape in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“In recent years we have observed a growing market for music rights which represent another way for owners of record labels and music libraries like portfolio holdings Warner Music Group and Sony (via its subsidiary Sony Music, ~25% of our estimated enterprise value) to deploy capital, grow their businesses and create value for shareholders.In the first few days of 2022 Warner closed a deal to acquire David Bowie’s back catalogue for about US$250m which follows on from Bruce Springsteen’s catalogue sale to Sony for upwards of US$500m and Bob Dylan’s sale to Universal Music for a similar amount.The trend in demand for music copyrights is clearly strengthening, with competition for these assets coming from traditional music companies (Warner, Sony) as well as specialist investors and private equity…” (Click here to see the full text)8. Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 38 Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX)’s eponymous mobile game is one of the earliest examples of a metaverse in action, as the game features a collection of virtual worlds and activities created by millions of different content creators that can then be engaged with by players, a small number of whom exist within the environment at the same time and can interact with one another. Players can also buy fashion items and accessories for their avatars, allowing them to develop a unique look that sets them apart from other players’ avatars.In addition to the millions of standard game and hangout rooms, Roblox has also played host to several live events, including live concert experiences from renowned artists like The Chainsmokers. However, the limitations and annoyances of the Roblox platform can somewhat obscure the immense promise of what the metaverse could be, as you’re constantly bombarded with popup ads and gaudy in-experience ads trying to sell you stuff at all times. Despite that, Roblox had nearly 60 million daily active users in September, showing how popular shared virtual worlds not only could be, but already are.Hedge funds have bailed on Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) over the past two quarters, pushing ownership of the stock down by 38%. Some of the eponymous game’s biggest bulls were doubling down on the stock during Q2 however, as Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management, and Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Management all raised their stakes in the company. The three funds own more than $750 million in RBLX shares as of June 30.Jefferies Group discussed Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX)’s potential opportunities and pitfalls with its Metaverse game in the fund’s Q3 2021 investor letter:“If we look at the Metaverse concept with more lenient guidelines for interoperability, then it becomes easier to see why certain companies are being referred to as Metaverse. On the virtual side, we’d point to companies like Epic Games, TakeTwo and Roblox. In augmented reality, it would be Niantic and SNAP. These are the large capitalized players in the space but albeit, not the only ones. We expect new mulit-billion dollar companies will rise as theMetaverse becomes more mature.Roblox is a good example. The content is almost entirely user generated, the engine that powers the developer studio is provided by Roblox and developers/creators share in almost all the money that users spend on the platform. In addition, many of the items that you purchase in the avatar marketplace, or even a branded experience like Vans World, can be taken across experiences. Roblox talks a lot about platform extension, which would move the platform beyond just gaming/leisure experiences and into education and workplace offerings. The developer community has the capability to build tools for other developers, there are professional studios being built on the platform and many consumer-facing brands/content are partnering with Roblox to ensure a virtual presence. Roblox actually has a lot of the pieces for our utopian definition of Metaverse, but things like technology, interoperability with outside platforms and a dynamic, two-way economy are what’s missing. However, given our thesis that full interoperability is somewhat unrealistic, it’s easy to see how Roblox fits the definition…Many already consider RBLX a Metaverse, or at least an early iteration of one, and here’s why. The platform offers all the tools required for content creation in a low-code / no code format and handles publication, language translations, billing, collections, safety and security of the environment and more. It’s hard to find a platform that makes the creative process easier for developers than Roblox; we see this as very supportive of creator economy.The content is almost entirely user generated and developers/creators share in almost all the money that users spend on the platform. The developer community has the capability to build tools for other developers, there are professional studios being built on the platform and many consumer-facing brands/content are partnering with Roblox to ensure a virtual presence. Roblox talks a lot about platform extension, which would move the platform beyond just gaming/leisure experiences and into education and workplace offerings. Lastly, many of the items that you purchase in the avatar marketplace, or even a branded experience like Vans World, can be taken across experiences. In essence, the RBLX ecosystem includes creator economy, a virtual platform, picks and shovels of the Metaverse and some interoperability – many of the key enablers for Metaverse.However, there’s always work to be done. We would expect to see a more dynamic economy emerge with resale moving beyond limited items and premium members, particularly with newer gaming models such as play-to-earn. Increasingly, gamers are going to want some return for the time and money invested on a platform. Advancements in technology will allow for truly shared experiences among a larger and larger group of people. We remain skeptical on the reality of interoperability; RBLX could very well end up being one of many Metaverses.”7. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 66 Chipmaker Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will be another major player powering the metaverse in the future. Yet while the company is optimistic about its potential, it also believes we’re a long way away from true metaverse experiences, where thousands or even millions of people could all exist within the same shared world at the same time rather than being walled off into tiny instances of a world that support only a limited number of users.In an editorial posted to the company’s website, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) senior vice president and head of the company’s Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group, Raja Koduri, believes we’ll need to achieve a 1,000-fold increase in computing power before true metaverses will be possible.For its part, Intel is going all-in on chipmaking again, perhaps with an eye on owning the metaverse, as the company recently announced plans to spin off its autonomous driving unit Mobileye.Hedge fund ownership of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has fallen by 23% since peaking at the end of the first quarter of 2021, including one of its steepest drops in smart money ownership during Q2. David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and Rob Citrone’s Discovery Capital Management were two prominent hedge funds that sold out of Intel during the quarter.Baron Funds explained why Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has failed to perform like some of its dot-com era peers in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Then, there is the case of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”6.

While the company is best known for powering many of the world’s mobile devices with its Snapdragon processors, it’s angling to be one of the leading players in the metaverse as well. The company recently partnered with Meta Platforms to build novel VR and AR experiences utilizing custom Snapdragon XR platforms.QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s venture capital arm has also deployed $100 million into a Metaverse fund to support the development of the metaverse ecosystem, specifically those that use the company’s XR platform.

Portfolio returns benefited from the strong performance of semiconductor maker Qualcomm, which has executed exceptionally well in pursuing the transition to 5G, growing both content and share due to its leadership position in cellular technology. The chipmaker recently outlined a number of peripheral growth opportunities outside of mobile markets, including automotive (where it hopes to leverage its strong presence in the automotive infotainment space into advanced driver assistance systems), Internet of Things (including opportunities in the PC market, VR/AR market, and factory automation) and radio frequency (where mmWave adoption globally, including China, would drive substantial upside).” Meta Platforms, Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy Now. According to PwC’s Global Entertainment and Media Outlook, the gaming industry is rapidly growing and the sector is anticipated to reach $321 billion by 2026. The expansion is supported by millions of people who got involved with gaming to escape the isolation of COVID-19 lockdowns. Gaming was one of the safest ways to maintain social connections amid the pandemic-driven chaos, and the sector has not lost steam despite lockdowns lifting worldwide. Existing and new gamers poured into games, consoles, and other gaming equipment during the pandemic, and resultantly, the market grew by 26% between 2019 and 2021. Companies timed their new releases and game launches strategically to gain from the pandemic boom. For example, Nintendo’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons was launched in March 2020 and within the first six weeks, 13.4 million units were sold. It features as one of the best-selling Nintendo Switch games.As per latest data published by DataReportal, internet traffic rose by 7.7% in 2021 compared to 2020. Moreover, the number of internet users grew by 4% to 4,950 million in January 2022 compared to the same period last year, when the users equaled 4,758 million. Using cloud technology in the gaming market will potentially boost the demand and engagement of multiplayers for numerous games, which will support further market growth. Some of the best gaming stocks to consider in order to play the boom in the sector include Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Our Methodology We selected the following gaming stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and future growth prospects. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. Story continues12 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Erik Mclean on UnsplashBest Gaming Stocks To Buy Now12. Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) was founded in 1889 and is headquartered in Kyoto, Japan. The company develops, manufactures, and sells home entertainment products in Japan, the Americas, Europe, and internationally. Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) provides video game platforms, playing cards, handheld and home console hardware systems, and related software. A depreciating yen will act as a tailwind for Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY)’s reported financials. On September 7, Goldman Sachs analyst Minami Munakata resumed coverage of Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) with a Buy rating and an 83,000 yen price target. The analyst expects Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) to sustain an elevated level of earnings, even in the midst of the product cycle for Nintendo Switch, the analyst told investors.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, Andrew Wellington and Jeff Keswin’s Lyrical Asset Management and Frederick Disanto’s Ancora Advisors collectively held stakes worth $738,000 in Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY). Like Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) is one of the best gaming stocks to buy now.Here is what Ensemble Capital has to say about Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTC:NTDOY) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Nintendo: Having had a banner year and a quarter last year with both its Switch console sales and megahit Animal Crossing: New Horizons game release, helped in part by COVID restrictions, Nintendo posted sales that were down -10% vs a year ago while operating income was down -17%. Consequently, the stock has had a challenged performance in the quarter, falling 19%. However, looking past the one-time nature of the comparison effects of the COVID bump last year, the more important fundamental metric to track for the company’s future business is its installed base of Switch consoles. The Switch installed base of customers has grown by about 50 million units to over 85 million since 2019, aided by a surge in interest in family gaming. We believe the family gaming trend is an important and persistent one and the huge increase in the installed base bodes well for future game and digital subscription sales going forward.”11. Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 10Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) is a California-based company that designs, markets, and distributes gaming and streaming equipment, components, and systems in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific. The company offers gaming peripherals such as gaming keyboards, mice, headsets, controllers, capture cards, stream decks, USB microphones, studio accessories, and EpocCam software. Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) is one of the best gaming stocks to invest in.After Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) negatively pre-announced its Q2 revenue and adjusted EBITDA along with its earnings date announcement, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter noted that slower user growth will likely extend Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR)’s upgrade cycle in the short-term, though he acknowledged that Q2 is ""likely the trough."" The analyst, who expects a return to ""normal"" in 2023 ""at the latest,"" reiterated an Outperform rating and a $22 price target on Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) shares. He is positive that Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) has developed a ""defensible niche"" with a majority of its sales originating from ""a small, but dedicated and growing base of hard-core gamers.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 10 hedge funds were long Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 12 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent position holder in the company, with 547,574 shares worth $7.19 million. Here is what Sterling Partners Equity Advisors has to say about Corsair Gaming, Inc.

Corsair delivers a full ecosystem of products; PC Components, Peripherals, Premium Streaming Equipment, and Smart Ambient Lighting. Corsair responded to the difficult sourcing and shipping environment by building inventory closer to its customers. Management believes that once this difficult supply chain is behind them their targeted growth and profitability targets will return. We believe in the growing gaming market globally and Corsair is positioned well to support this growing customer base with a platter of products.”10. Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the company is engaged in the ownership and operation of a diversified entertainment platform in the United States. Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) has four key segments – Nevada Casino Resorts, Nevada Locals Casinos, Maryland Casino Resort, and Distributed Gaming. The Distributed Gaming segment operates slot machines and amusement devices in non-casino locations, including restaurants, bars, liquor stores, and grocery stores. Jefferies analyst Cassandra Lee on September 7 assumed coverage of Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) with a Buy recommendation and a $64 price target. Given the company's ""balance sheet strength and strong fundamentals"" across regional markets in Nevada, it could chase growth more intensely or increase shareholder returns with the proceeds from Rocky Gap sale, ""either of which imply continued upside,"" the analyst told investors in a bullish thesis. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 21 funds reported owning stakes worth $163.6 million in Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) at the end of June 2022, compared to 21 in the prior quarter worth $276.2 million. Richard Driehaus’ Driehaus Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 1.13 million shares valued at nearly $45 million. 9. PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Next on our list of the best gaming stocks is PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN), a Pennsylvania-based company that provides integrated entertainment, sports content, and casino gaming experiences in North America. On October 10, PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) signed a new leasing arrangement with Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (NASDAQ:GLPI) to promote casino growth and relocations. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be effective from January 1, 2023.On October 6, Canaccord analyst Jason Tilchen initiated coverage of PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) with a Buy rating and a $50 price target. Commercial gambling in the U.S. exceeded $50 billion in gross gaming revenue for the first time last year, noted the analyst, who forecasts the industry to nearly double over the next decade. At present levels, investors can access ""a very reasonably valued, consistent, and strongly profitable regional casino business"" with upside from the quickly expanding online sports betting and iGaming markets, the analyst added.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 33 hedge funds were long PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 36 funds in the preceding quarter. Parag Vora’s HG Vora Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.50 million shares worth $106.5 million. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) declined 28.3% in the quarter and penalized performance by 71 bps. This was due to investor concerns that a potential recession would result in a slowdown or decline in growth. The company has seen no material change to its visitation or spending levels, and its earnings remain strong. Penn is generating strong cash flow to more than offset investments in its digital growth opportunity. It is using excess cash to buy back its stock. Penn is well positioned to weather a slowdown or recession and, if one does occur, the company should still generate revenue and EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels.Management continues to use its excess cash for share repurchases and debt reduction as well as continuing investments in its digital businesses. We think the $50 million of losses this year from its digital business is modest in relation to Penn’s $1 billion of casino EBITDA. The losses from its digital business represent customer acquisition costs incurred as additional states legalize online gambling. Since it is far less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, we expect marketing costs to decline as Penn builds its customer base.Penn’s core bricks and mortar casino business remains strong, and the company has a healthy regional casino business and a strong balance sheet to fund its digital losses.”8. International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) is a London-based company that provides gaming technology products and services in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The company has three primary segments – Global Lottery, Global Gaming, and Digital &amp; Betting. On October 6, International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) announced that its cashless gaming solutions, Resort Wallet and IGTPay, were being used at Indigo Sky Casino in Wyandotte, Okla. International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) is helping multiple casino operators such as Indigo Sky Casino transition to cashless gaming and modernize the guest experience. It is one of the best gaming stocks to buy now. On August 3, Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli reiterated a Buy rating on International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) but trimmed the price target on the stock to $30 from $35 after the ""solid"" Q2 results.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) was part of 34 public stock portfolios at the end of Q2 2022, with collective stakes worth $263.5 million. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is a significant position holder in the company, with 1.86 million shares valued at $34.6 million. Here is what Palm Harbour Capital has to say about International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“The second largest contributor was International Game Technology, the ItalianAmerican lottery and slot machine company, which we introduced in our first quarter 2020 letter and which contributed 78 basis points to performance. Early in the quarter, IGT’s main competitor, the highly levered Scientific Games, entered into a definitive agreement to sell its lottery business to Brookfield Business Partners for total consideration of $6.1 billion in cash and contingent payout. At $471 million last twelve months EBITDA (admittedly COVID affected, excluding unallocated central costs), Scientific Games lottery business was sold at trailing 13.0x. Scientific Games exited the lottery business to optimize the portfolio and aggressively de-lever its balance sheet. We believe IGT’s lottery business to be much higher quality and certainly larger. If we were to use a similar metric for IGT, including all corporate costs but excluding Gaming and Digital and Betting, we would have around 90% upside. We are willing to bet the Gaming and fast growing Digital and Betting segments are worth something as well. It seems the sell-side willfully ignores this transaction and sticks with their 7-8x EV/EBITDA valuation.The company reported third quarter earnings with sales up by 21% year on year, EBIT up by 144% and leverage down to 3.8x from 6.4x at year-end 2020. Total Adjusted EBITDA improved by 42% with margin gaining 618 basis points. Following the recovery, management reinstated the dividend of $0.20 per share…” (Click here to see the full text)7.

Business conditions have been strong, yet the shares are valued at only 6 times 2022 estimated cash flow versus a long-term average of more than 9 times cash flow. The company maintains a strong and liquid balance sheet. Insiders own approximately 27% of the company. We believe Boyd is a compelling acquisition target.”6.

NVRO gained 5% on Oct 13, following the announcement of the FDA approval for its spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system — Senza HFX iQ — for the treatment of chronic pain. The new SCS system includes HFX iQ Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG), HFX Trial Stimulator, Charger and HFX App. The system is designed to launch algorithms specifically for treating chronic back and leg pain, including non-surgical back pain and painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN).The Senza HFX iQ utilizes Nevro’s superior high-frequency 10 kHz Therapy platform, which has the potential to provide treatment benefits to a broader group of chronic pain indications. The company has already filed a regulatory application for approval in Europe.The recent approval expands the company’s flagship platform, Senza — first approved in the United States in 2015. The next-generation Senza HFX iQ is the first and only system to use artificial intelligence (AI) for optimizing pain relief for each patient based on their response. The AI-based SCS system has been designed to address the variability in pain from patient to patient.Shares of Nevro have declined 52.8% so far this year compared with the industry’s decrease of 38.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe digitally-enabled Senza HFX iQ system has been designed to optimize care by collecting patient data and providing a customized treatment pathway for each patient, which can be accessed through a smartphone. The company believes that the system provides several key advantages over existing SCS systems. The HFX Algorithm is most likely to be effective in achieving pain relief in patients as it has been built based on more than 20 million datapoints and 80,000 implanted patients. The system will provide a connected, digital environment that will help a patient to get customized therapy adjustments based on inputs through HFX app on a smartphone and share patient-level outcomes with treating and referring physicians. The system is also designed to allow future updates to the HFX Algorithm, as well as new features and capabilities for patients and providers.Story continuesNevro initiated the limited launch of Senza HFX iQ in the United States in the third quarter. The company is planning a broad U.S. market launch in early 2023.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Market Data Forecast, the global SCS market was estimated to be $1,871.6 million in 2020 and is anticipated to reach $2,827.4 million by the end of 2025 at a CAGR of 8.6%. Factors like rising cases of chronic and neuropathic pain and the growing adoption of SCS therapy are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest positive coverages are expected to significantly boost Nevro’s business worldwide.Notable DevelopmentsIn August, Aetna — one of the largest health plans — provided a draft proposal for including spinal cord stimulation (SCS) coverage policy to explicitly cover PDN. Nevro believes that once the proposal is finalized, it will imply that Medicare patients in all 50 states will enjoy coverage for PDN and will add approximately 17 million covered Medicare lives.  However, the review of the proposed LCDs is ongoing and the final dates have not yet been confirmed.In July, Nevro announced positive clinical data from the complete 12-month results from the SENZA-PDN Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), including health-related quality of life outcomes in patients with PDN treated with high-frequency 10 kHz SCS.In June, Nevro announced positive results from data presentations at the American Diabetes Association’s Scientific Sessions. The data supported the use of 10 kHz SCS therapy for patients with chronic pain, including results from the SENZA PDN RCT.Nevro Corp. PriceNevro Corp. PriceNevro Corp. price | Nevro Corp.

267,2467349b-26fe-3f1d-abba-11d82421f784,MCK,2022-10-15,Quest Diagnostics (DGX) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-dgx-report-q3-162304597.html,1665764584,STORY,"['DGX', 'MCK']","[Quest Diagnostics Incorporated DGX is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 20, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.36 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.42%. Its earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 12.06%.Factors at PlayQuest Diagnostics is likely to have benefited from the continued sales rebound in the non-COVID base business as economic activities return to pre-pandemic levels.The non-COVID base business is expected to have gained from the company’s efforts to expand value-based contracts with payers. Over the past few months, the company has accelerated growth through health plan access. Excluding COVID-19, health plan volumes and revenues are seen growing faster than the overall base business. We expect value-based contracts (over the last two years DGX has renewed 12 national and large regional health plan contracts) to align better with health plans, allowing it to gain share in Q3.In this regard, earlier in 2022, Quest Diagnostics was selected as one of UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network providers for the fourth consecutive year. Other notable partnerships include the joint venture (JV) with Sonora Quest, where the JV resulted in approximately 3.7 million molecular tests (as per the company’s July update). These contracts might have contributed to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Apart from this, the company is expanding its diagnostic information services portfolio. In this regard, we may note Quest Diagnostics’ recent collaboration with IRIS (Intelligent Retinal Imaging Systems) to offer diabetic retinal imaging services through designated Quest Diagnostics patient service centers across the United States. The new service extends the Quest Diagnostics Extended Care portfolio of services, which aims to facilitate access to care beyond traditional healthcare settings.Story continuesQuest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseQuest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseQuest Diagnostics Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteHowever, the base business is likely to have faced continued inflationary headwinds as it did in the second quarter. To offset the inflationary pressure, Quest Diagnostics has been making several investments to strengthen advanced diagnostics capabilities within the base business.In the to-be-reported quarter, Quest Diagnostics’ COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to have declined year over year, owing to a robust year-ago comparison. Per its last-released media statement in October,the company noted that demand for its COVID-19 molecular testing in July was consistent with June. However, demand for COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing declined in August versus the prior month. This decline in COVID-19 diagnostic testing demand is likely to have significantly impacted sales in Q3. Also, the sales performance is anticipated to have been impacted by the reduced average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing.On a positive note, the FDA in September granted DGX the emergency use authorization for its monkeypox virus PCR test, the first EUA for a monkeypox in-vitro diagnostic during the monkeypox public health emergency. This might have provided a favorable boost to the company’s testing sales growth in Q3.Q3 EstimatesFor third-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.34 billion, indicating a 15.5% decline from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.14, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 45.9%.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates.

MMSI is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by its strong product portfolio. A robust second-quarter 2022 performance, along with its solid international exposure, is expected to contribute further. However, headwinds related to higher consolidation in the healthcare industry and the lack of direct sales and marketing capabilities persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 8.5% compared with a 21.9% decline of the industry and a 25.5% decline of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned medical-devices provider has a market capitalization of $3.19 billion. The company is projected to record 10.5% growth over the next five years on the back of its continued strong segmental performance. It delivered an earnings surprise of 24.7% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about Merit Medical’s continued gains on the significant momentum of its new products. We are also optimistic about the company’s product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products. Last month, the company announced the launch of the SCOUT Mini Reflector, which has been designed for use in soft tissues, such as breast and lymph nodes.The company, in April, launched the ReSolve Thoracostomy Tray, which has all products needed for performing a thoracostomy.International Exposure: We are upbeat about Merit Medical’s current global operations, including its territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America, Mexico, and Canada. In the second quarter of 2022, Merit Medical confirmed that its international sales (44.2% of net sales) improved 13.6% organically from the corresponding period of 2021. This included increased sales of 0.9% in APAC operations, 59.5% in Rest of the World operations and 6.2% in EMEA operations, reportedly.Strong Q2 Results: Merit Medical’s robust second-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company also saw solid segmental growth and growth across all product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Solid product sales and robust performances in both the United States and outside were also witnessed. Strong execution and improving customer demand trends raised the overall top line. Expansion of the adjusted operating margin also bodes well.Story continuesDownsidesHigher Consolidation in the Healthcare Industry: Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. Thus, in order to provide healthcare solutions at a cheaper rate and eradicate competition, large-cap MedTech behemoths have started consolidating with mid-cap and small-cap companies. This enables the availability of healthcare products at low prices in the market. Per management, such trends compel Merit Medical’s customers to ask for price concessions in its products, which act against its ongoing business strategies. This may also exert a solid downward pressure on the price of Merit Medical’s products and reduce the customer base.Lack of Direct Sales and Marketing Capabilities: Merit Medical lacks direct sales and marketing capabilities in many countries. The company wholly depends on third-party distributors for the commercialization of products in countries like China, Japan, Russia and India. Per management, because of inefficiencies in the distributor base, Merit Medical often fails to successfully commercialize its products in these countries.Estimate TrendMerit Medical is witnessing a stable estimate trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has been stable at $2.47.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $273 million, suggesting a 2.3% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

The U.S. unveiling of the new breast cancer treatment package for the Radixact System will be conducted at the upcoming ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) Annual Meeting in San Antonio, TX.The new breast cancer treatment package for the Radixact System, whose name will be revealed during the unveiling at ASTRO, is not available for sale in the United States. It is yet to receive the FDA’s 510(k) approval and is not CE marked. The package’s availability is subject to regulatory clearance or approval in some markets.The latest launch is expected to be a step forward for Accuray to strengthen its radiation therapy business on a global scale.Significance of the LaunchPer the National Cancer Institute’s estimates shared by Accuray, besides skin cancers, breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. In rare cases, breast cancer can also occur in men. Breast cancer treatment represents over 20% of cases encountered by radiation oncology departments.Accuray’s breast cancer treatment package has been designed to enable medical care teams to provide an integrated and automated Deep Inspiration Breath Hold solution using Surface Guided Radiation Therapy that delivers precise treatments that enhance safety and speed. With this capability, the Radixact System is now expected to offer a comprehensive toolset currently available in the industry by leveraging superior CT image quality from proprietary ClearRT imaging with the CT-linac capabilities of TomoHelical and TomoDirect deliveries in faster treatment time slots.Per Accuray’s management, the new option for the Radixact System for treating a wide range of breast cancer patients will likely improve lives as this cancer remains a significant women's health issue. Management feels that early detection and more precise treatment technology can have a significant impact on extending and improving the quality of patients' lives.Story continuesC-RAD’s management believes that for breast cancer treatments, the seamless workflow allows deep inspiration treatment on the Radixact System to reduce the dose exposure to the heart, amongst other benefits.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global radiotherapy market is valued at $6.3 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to reach $8.1 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 5.1%. Factors like technological advancements in radiotherapy and the rising incidence of cancer are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is expected to provide a significant boost to Accuray’s business globally.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Accuray announced positive results of the PACE-B (Prostate Advances in Comparative Evidence) trial that were published in The Lancet Oncology. The trial indicates that two years after treatment, patients treated with the company's CyberKnife robotic radiotherapy platform have a lower incidence of late grade two or higher bladder toxicities, which are associated with prostate cancer stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatments, unlike with conventional linear accelerators.Last month, Accuray announced that it is expanding its global footprint with the introduction of its CyberKnife platform in Africa, thereby increasing access to the extremely precise stereotactic radiosurgery and SBRT treatments the system delivers to more patients.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 49.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 33.4% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 18.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Accuray carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Its bottom-line estimates imply growth of 16.3% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues suggests year-over-year increase of 15.6%. Over the trailing four quarters, Winnebago surpassed earnings estimates on all occasions, with the average surprise being 30.73%. This is depicted in the graph below:Winnebago Industries, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseWinnebago Industries, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseWinnebago Industries, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Winnebago Industries, Inc. QuoteQ3 HighlightsWinnebago topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in the third-quarter fiscal 2022. Its adjusted earnings per share of $4.13 surpassed the consensus metric of $3.01 and surged 84% year over year. This outperformance was led by higher-than-anticipated revenues across all segments. It reported revenues of $1,458 million in the quarter that outpaced the consensus mark of $1,204 million and grew 52% year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for the recreational vehicle (RV) maker for the quarter to be reported, as it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. A combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Winnebago has an Earnings ESP of -8.24%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate of $2.74 a share falls short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.99.Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors at PlayThe RV industry picked pace during the pandemic as remote working gained popularity and travel and vacations saw a demand surge once the pandemic restrictions were eased. However, sky-high inflation and interest rates in recent times have been a damper on the industry as recessionary fears loom large. These are likely to have affected RV travel to some extent, which might have weighed on deliveries of Winnebago in the to-be-reported quarter. The tight market conditions have increased the manufacturing costs of RVs, which are likely to have weighed on the margins as well.Let’s take a look at the key fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 projections for the company’s segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues from the Towables segment is pegged at $647 million, indicating a decline from $806 million recorded in the previous quarter. The consensus mark for units sold in this segment is 17,171, decreasing from 17,675 units reported in the prior quarter. The estimate for adjusted EBITDA in the segment, pegged at $101 million, also suggests a decline from $118 million.The consensus mark for revenues from the Motorhome segment is $453 million, declining from $516 million recorded in the previous quarter. The estimate for units sold is 2,812, decreasing from 3,201 reported a quarter ago. The adjusted EBITDA estimate in the segment is $54 million, down from $64 million.The consensus mark for revenues from the Marine segment is $100 million, falling from $127 million recorded in the previous quarter. The adjusted EBITDA estimate in the segment is $14.17 million, marking a decline from $19.81 million.Stocks With Favorable CombinationWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Winnebago, here are a few players from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:Genuine Parts GPC will release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 20. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.82% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Genuine Parts’ to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.03 per share and $5.39 billion, respectively. GPC surpassed earnings estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 11.03%.Oshkosh OSK will release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27. The company has an Earnings ESP of +7.92% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Oshkosh’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.17 per share and $2.15 billion, respectively. OSK surpassed earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed in the rest, with the average surprise being a negative 13.62%.Lear LEA will release third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +11.72% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cummins’ to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.15 per share and $5.18 billion, respectively.

The second season of Chrissy’s Court was the highest-rated unscripted Roku Originals launch ever and delivered four times more unique views than the first season.The upcoming feature film, WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story, which is scheduled to be released on Nov 4, is anticipated to attract advertisers due to the new opportunities to engage with Roku Originals.Roku anticipates revenues in third-quarter 2022 to rise 3% year over year to $700 million.Roku Faces Major Headwinds From Strong CompetitionDespite investing in growing its library, Roku faces immense competition from existing local traditional pay TV services and products, including those provided by incumbent pay TV service providers and mobile streaming platforms.Roku, which currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), has lost 77.2% of its share price year to date against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which declined 42% in the same time frame.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Roku also faces stiff competition from Netflix NFLX, Disney DIS and Apple AAPL, which have extensive content portfolios and strong brand identities.Netflix has lost 61.4% whereas Disney declined 37.6% year to date. Both Disney and Netflix are set to launch their ad-tier subscriptions for customers by the end of this year. This low-cost subscription is expected to gain traction.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 63% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.4% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 45% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Walt Disney which might hurt individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Walt Disney. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walt Disney?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Walt Disney already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Walt Disney, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Walt Disney. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Walt DisneyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Walt Disney Company in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$140m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 37% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Walt Disney. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

NDAQ is slated to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 19, before the opening bell. The company delivered an earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, the average being 5.59%.Factors to ConsiderSolid organic revenue growth, strong performance at index and analytics businesses and contributions from the acquisition of Verafin are likely to have aided Nasdaq’s third-quarter performance.Improved performance at Market Technology, Market Data, Index and Analytics businesses are expected to have benefited non-trading revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytics revenues is pegged at $55 million, indicating an increase of 7.8% from the year-ago reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Market Technology revenues is pegged at $286 million, while we expect the same to be $283.3 million.The Solutions segment is expected to have benefited from a compelling index and analytics portfolio, the expansion of the listed issuer base as well as anti-financial crime offerings, and improved demand for IR and ESG services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $586 million.Expenses are likely to have increased owing to the development and diversification of its business, compensation and benefits, merger and strategic initiatives, restructuring charges, general, administrative and other expenses. These are expected to have weighed on margin expansion.The continued share buyback is anticipated to have provided an additional boost to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 65 cents, indicating a 10.2% increase from the prior-year reported figure.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 84% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Comcast. View our latest analysis for Comcast ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Comcast does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Comcast's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Comcast. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.1% and 7.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Brian Roberts directly holds 0.8% of the total shares outstanding.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of ComcastThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Comcast Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.2b of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Comcast  you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Through the years, we have seen results that we are incredibly proud of - millions have been connected, learned new skillsets, and leveraged opportunities. However, research, news, and our own experiences continue to make clear that while digital inequity remains a pressing issue, there are numerous promising community-centered pathways that can accelerate progress for tens of thousands of households.Last year, building on our longstanding work to close the digital divide, we launched Project UP, our comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity. Essential to this work are our partnerships with local, frontline community partners. By investing in partners who are trusted leaders and advocates with credibility and close relationships on the ground, we can work together to achieve real results and solve inequities.This proximity-driven strategy was on full display at one of my recent trips to Tacoma, Washington. Together with Mayor Victoria Woodards, Comcast announced its investment of $300,000 to support the Boys and Girls Club, Goodwill, Thrive Tacoma Business Fund, and Team Wrk in the South Puget Sound region by increasing broadband adoption for those who are still not connected; helping small businesses access the digital skills needed to grow; and ensuring students receive critical learning and development resources. Combined, our programs are targeted at closing the digital skills and access gap, and building comprehensive, inclusive digital equity.In Tacoma, and in cities and regions across the country, innovative municipal and community-based leadership are collectively helping to incrementally close the digital divide nationwide.I'm incredibly proud to work with leaders like Mayor Woodards, the Tacoma-Pierce County Chamber, Boys &amp; Girls Club of South Puget Sound President and CEO Carrie Holden, and Goodwill of the Olympic &amp; Rainier Region President and CEO Lori Forte Harnick. I consider each of them visionary partners - and friends who all share a real commitment to making an impact.Story continuesStrong ties between the public, private, and non-profit sectors are essential to addressing barriers to Internet adoption and creating more equitable pathways to economic opportunity. This is one of many great examples and there is much more ahead as we continue to look to our local leaders who are advancing important initiatives, and to local voices who can help us connect with their communities. Together, we will continue to help create a future of unlimited possibilities.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: http://www.comcastcorporation.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720479/Investing-Locally-To-Drive-Impact-Nationally]"

295,231903ae-93fe-362f-b161-89081f1631ce,DVN,2022-10-15,Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporation-dvn-trending-130001210.html,1665752401,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned +4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has gained 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $2.24 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +107.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.10 points to a change of +157.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.03 indicates a change of +10.2% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $4.93 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +42.2%. The $19.81 billion and $19.98 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +66.2% and +0.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +132.8%. EPS of $2.59 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +17.26%. The EPS surprise was +8.82%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

296,fd50ec2f-e87a-3d6e-adc4-6ded19d30445,URI,2022-10-15,Why United Rentals (URI) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-united-rentals-uri-could-161004747.html,1665763804,STORY,['URI'],"[Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? United Rentals (URI), which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This equipment rental company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14.08%.For the most recent quarter, United Rentals was expected to post earnings of $6.57 per share, but it reported $7.86 per share instead, representing a surprise of 19.63%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $5.28 per share, while it actually produced $5.73 per share, a surprise of 8.52%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for United Rentals. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.United Rentals has an Earnings ESP of +0.18% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 26, 2022.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 9.03%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.51%.Oracle will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Oracle is projected to report earnings of $1.18 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 2.48%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.05 billion, up 16.29% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.97 per share and revenue of $49.62 billion, which would represent changes of +1.43% and +16.91%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Oracle. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 1.62% lower. Oracle is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).Looking at its valuation, Oracle is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 13.11. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 22.49, so we one might conclude that Oracle is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that ORCL has a PEG ratio of 1.64. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ORCL's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.92 as of yesterday's close.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, which puts it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The share prices don’t tend to fall as much as unprofitable and unproven stocks that are viewed as more speculative investments.Blue-chip stocks also tend to recover faster in periods when the markets rise again. That said, there are plenty of cheap blue-chip stocks that are down 20% or more amid this year’s market rout, presenting attractive entry points for investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven cheap blue-chip stocks to buy before they rebound.AAPLApple’s$142.60PEPPepsiCo’s$180.19HDHome Depot $310.16VVisa $203.23BACBank of America$37.69BRK-BBerkshire Hathaway$296.72FFord$14.17Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comThe consumer electronics giant has not been immune to this year’s market downturn. So far in 2022, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has fallen 25% making it one of the best cheap blue-chip stocks to buy. Rather than fret about the selloff, investors should use the decline in the share price to buy Apple stock hand over fist.Silicon Valley-based Apple remains one of the biggest and best technology companies in the world and it is rare that investors get a chance at such a favorable entry point with the stock, which is currently trading at $136 a share.AAPL stock recently took a big hit after it was reported that Covid-19 lockdowns in China are impacting production of its newest iPhone. However, this is a temporary problem. Innovation and market dominance should help Apple weather the current storm.Story continuesLong-term the company, and its stock, should be just fine.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comSnack and beverage company PepsiCo’s (NASDAQ:PEP) share price is actually up this year, having gained 5% compared to a 34% decline in the Nasdaq. PEP stock is currently trading at $180 a share, near its 52-week high.The company’s products, which include everything from the Pepsi soft drink and Frito Lay chips to Quaker Oatmeal and the Gatorade sports drink, are considered essential grocery items by the consumers who love them.In 2021, PepsiCo generated $79 billion in revenue from its food and beverage products. The company barely missed a beat during the Covid-19 pandemic as sales of its consumer products held up remarkably well.PepsiCo is also managing the current inflationary environment thanks to its pricing power, or ability to raise prices without losing customers.Plus, PepsiCo pays a dividend that currently yields a strong 2.54% or $1.15 a share each quarter.In March of this year, PepsiCo announced that it is raising its dividend by 7%, bringing the total increase over the past five years to 43%. The company is also buying back $1.5 billion of PEP stock this year, making it one of the cheap blue-chip stocks to buy with a bright future.Home Depot (HD)Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue skySource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.comHome Depot (NYSE:HD) stock is down 29% this year making it one of the hottest cheap blue-chip stocks to buy. Now is an opportune time to grab HD stock at a deeply discounted price.Long term, Home Depot is likely to remain a great investment given its dominance of the home renovation and do-it-yourself home repair markets. Even with this year’s decline, Home Depot’s stock has still gained 78% over the past five years.The second quarter results this year built on the strongest first-quarter sales on record for Home Depot. Looking ahead, Home Depot has stood by its forecast for total and comparable sales to grow by 3% for all of this year.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V), one of the three largest credit card issuers in the world, currently sits 11% lower than where it was trading at before the pandemic. It is one of the cheap blue-chip stocks to keep your eyes on.Coming out of the pandemic, with travel and in-person dining resuming, V stock was expected by many analysts to rebound strongly.The slow return of higher-margin international transactions on its credit cards has been a drag on the stock.Visa is also grappling with the loss of its Russian business following that country’s invasion of Ukraine. Yet, despite its current issues, Visa remains a solid long-term investment.Over the past five years, the stock has returned 75% to shareholders. Visa is currently selling for 25 times this year’s projected earnings, which is rock bottom for the company.Bank of America (BAC)A photo of the Bank of America (BAC) logo in neon red and blue on a tan wall.Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comBank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock looks extremely cheap at its current price. Down 20% on the year amid a broad selloff in all bank stocks, BAC shares are currently one of the cheapest blue-chip stocks to buy before they rebound.The share price decline doesn’t take away from the fact that Bank of America, the second biggest lender in the U.S., remains a very appealing long-term investment.Bank of America should perform well going forward as the interest on its variable rate loans resets at higher levels following rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.Additionally, Bank of America has improved its deposit base, which now sits at $1 trillion, and has invested significantly in technology to improve its online presence and electronic transactions.Plus, Bank of America has a big wealth management arm, and its trading unit continues to make hay out of the current stock market volatility. All and all, BAC stock remains a safe bet for investors.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comConsidered by many to be the ultimate blue-chip stock, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has proven time and again that its share price can outperform the market in any environment.And, for now, it’s among the cheap blue-chip stocks that have room to run.Berkshire Hathaway owns a massive portfolio of stocks valued at more than $300 billion.Buffett’s careful portfolio construction and buy-and-hold strategy has famously carried Berkshire Hathaway through many a market downturn, from the Black Monday crash of 1987 to the dot-com bubble bursting in 2000 and the 2008-09 financial crisis. Each time BRK.B stock has emerged stronger on the other side.The company just reported strong third-quarter financial results that showed a 20% increase in its operating profit. The company also bought back $1 billion of its own stock in the July through September period.Ford (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comShares of legendary automaker Ford (NYSE:F) have been beaten up more than most cheap blue-chip stocks this year. The Detroit-based company has seen its share price knocked down 38% year to date.While the market downturn is mostly to blame, Ford has also been hurt by ongoing difficulties with global supply chains that have made it difficult to source the parts needed for its vehicles, which has, in turn, slowed its production.Yet, long term there’s plenty to like about Ford and its stock. The company is pushing hard into electric vehicles and has made no bones about the fact that it wants to challenge market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for supremacy in the space.Electric versions of its iconic vehicles such as the Mustang sports car and F-150 pick-up truck could help the Detroit automaker gain market share and eventually become a global leader in the fast-growing EV sector.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL, V and BAC.

She is heavily involved in her community and has been incredibly brave in recent years, sharing her personal story of how racial injustice has impacted her work family as well as her personal family.Yum! Brands, Friday, October 14, 2022, Press release pictureShe is authentic, vulnerable, courageous, and truly knows how to create an environment where customers and team members alike, feel like they belong … and feel like they're part of the Pizza Hut® restaurant family. Her team says that she is resourceful, is approachable and that she loves what she does. She truly empowers her team to create and foster real connections with each other.That's why she was recently awarded the Pizza Hut Proud Award, presented by Pizza Hut, LLC U.S. Chief People Officer Jamie Harrison and Chief Operations Officer Chequan Lewis, pictured above to the left and right of Alston. And, that's why Pizza Hut, LLC wants to share more about Maria!Maria, how do you create a culture of belonging at your restaurants?I am not afraid to share myself with my team. They are truly my family, and they know I would do anything for them just like they do for me. My team shares each other's best and worst times in life - graduations, marriages, baby showers, birthdays, illnesses and funerals. We have always celebrated and cried together.I started my first semester at Excelsior University this summer in hopes of receiving my degree in business. My goal is to show my team that working at a Pizza Hut® restaurant can make other things possible and help us become our best.A few years ago, during a local protest, one of the restaurants you manage was damaged and you helped rally the community to come together. What other community happenings are you involved in?I don't do this alone or by myself. I have a great group of managers who make this all happen. The restaurants I manage are near a military base. Not only is there a close relationship with the military families, but my team members know the families by name. Recently, restaurant teams near the military base attended a ceremony to remember fallen service members and provided food for the families.Story continuesMy restaurant managers and teams donate clothes, adopt families during the holidays, and donate food weekly through the Harvest Program to Brother Beno's foundation which feeds families in need of a warm meal. The team also works with Teri Inc., a non-profit organization that provides training to individuals with autism and other disabilities, by training individuals to help give them a sense of responsibility.How do you think the Pizza Hut Brand has progressed since the protests and what do you think is the next step?I believe speaking up, listening, and showing support to our people was a huge first step. In a time of feeling helpless, afraid, and uncertain, I can't begin to explain how empowering it was to have the president of Pizza Hut, LLC at the time, Kevin Hochman, say that Pizza Hut stands against racism, oppression, violence, hatred or intolerance towards Black people.A lot of businesses were closing their doors and upset that people were protesting on their street. Summit Restaurant Group' COO and CPO supported us by allowing its employees to miss work to protest and offer water and pizza to protesters. Summit Restaurant Group was not afraid of backlash because its people come first.The next step is to continue to embrace and highlight Summit Restaurant Group' employees for who they truly are. Continue to stand for and take pride in people of different genders, religions, sexual orientations, abilities, and ethnicities. Continue listening, speaking out and making changes as we continue to educate ourselves. But more than anything, Summit Restaurant Group trains its leaders to build relationships. Exclusion doesn't always happen on purpose; too often people are simply not self-aware of their actions and the repercussions.What did it mean to you to be recognized with the Pizza Hut Proud award?I can't put that feeling in words. I never intended to do any of this for recognition but for the sense of purpose and fulfillment, and hopefully to inspire others to speak up and be proud of who they are. My team inspires me because they are all very different and we all have been through so much. These struggles remind us that true leadership is about how we make others feel. Speaking up can make a huge difference to an individual or a whole community. I was just thrilled to feel heard and understood and to know that pizza is just a small part of who we are.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum!

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 2.37%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.35%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.21%.Heading into today, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had lost 2.65% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 7.64% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 6.51% in that time.McDonald's will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 27, 2022. In that report, analysts expect McDonald's to post earnings of $2.57 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 6.88%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $5.71 billion, down 7.9% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.80 per share and revenue of $22.62 billion. These totals would mark changes of +5.6% and -2.58%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.29% lower. McDonald's is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesInvestors should also note McDonald's's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 25.18. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 20.41, so we one might conclude that McDonald's is trading at a premium comparatively.Also, we should mention that MCD has a PEG ratio of 2.71. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Retail - Restaurants was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.91 at yesterday's closing price.The Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector.

The company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to $1.52 per share. The new dividend will be paid on Dec 15 to shareholders on record as of Dec 1.Following the hike, the company’s new annualized dividend amounted to $6.08 per share, giving a yield of 2.4%. In 2021, the company raised its dividend by 7%. MCD’s payout ratio is 56, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 7.3%.Notably, McDonald’s has a history of increasing dividends every year since the inception of its dividend payout policy in 1976. The company has increased dividends for 46 consecutive years.Dividend hikes not only enhance shareholder returns but also raise the market value of the stock. Therefore, companies often tend to attract new investors and retain old ones through this strategy.We appreciate McDonald's consistent efforts to enhance shareholder returns, despite the high inflation affecting most industries. These initiatives reflect the company’s business strength and the sustainability of its cash flows.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 1.9% against the industry’s 14.4% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExpansion Strategy Driving GrowthThe company is very confident in its growth strategy and continues to focus on driving long-term profitable growth for all its shareholders. McDonald’s is the world’s largest chain of fast-food restaurants with its presence in more than 100 countries. Its offerings have reached a billion-dollar brand status through sustained product innovations and geographic expansions.McDonald’s believes that there is a huge opportunity to grow all its brands globally by expanding its presence in existing markets and entering new ones. Its expansion efforts continue to drive performance. Despite the coronavirus outbreak, the company continues to expand its global footprint.The company is planning to open more than 1,800 restaurants globally in 2022, which includes 500 openings in the United States and IOM segments and 1,300 (including nearly 800 in China) inaugurations in the IDL market. The company expects restaurant growth to be nearly 3.5% in 2022.Story continuesKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are Wingstop Inc. WING, Yum China Holdings, Inc.

Market participants remain concerned about the Fed’s decision about the future course of interest rate movement.The consumer price index (CPI) for the month of September came in hotter than expected. The headline CPI rose 0.4% month over month compared with the consensus estimate of a 0.2% rise. Year over year, CPI increased 8.2% in September compared with 8.3% in August.Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) rose 0.6% month over month in September, beating the consensus estimate of a 0.3% increase. Year over year, core CPI increased 6.6% in September compared with 86.5% in August.As the interest rate is surging in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed to a 20-year high in 2022.Economists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in huge demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolio. We believe one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments. Five such companies are McDonald's Corp. MCD, Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, Riley Exploration Permian Inc. REPX, Commercial Metals Co. CMC and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc. SKT. McDonald's increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. MCD is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in the international markets. Robust digitalization will help McDonald's in driving long-term growth and capturing market share. MCD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesOn Oct 13, 2022, McDonald's declared that its shareholders would receive a dividend of $1.52 per share on Dec 15, 2022. MCD has a dividend yield of 2.5%. Over the past 5 years, McDonald's has increased its dividend five times, and its payout ratio presently stays at 56% of earnings. Check MCD’s dividend history here.McDonald's Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)McDonald's Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)McDonald's Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | McDonald's Corporation QuoteCostco’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping COST register impressive sales and earnings numbers.We expect the company to register a 9.2% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2023 on 8.6% revenue growth. This outlook accounts for COST’s ability to navigate the ongoing inflationary environment and supply-chain bottlenecks on several fronts. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming.

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United Parcel ServiceThe Executive VP &amp; Chief Marketing Officer, Kevin Warren, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$192 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$162). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price. Kevin Warren was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

In total, Executive VP &amp; Chief Marketing Officer Kevin Warren sold US$2.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of United Parcel ServiceI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. United Parcel Service insiders own 0.08% of the company, currently worth about US$111m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About United Parcel Service Insiders?An insider sold United Parcel Service shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since United Parcel Service is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales.

316,7720088b-1cb2-355b-ad71-2b2880c9d81c,AXP,2022-10-15,American Express (AXP) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-axp-earnings-expected-140002081.html,1665756002,STORY,['AXP'],"[The market expects American Express (AXP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis credit card issuer and global payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.3%.Revenues are expected to be $13.52 billion, up 23.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.61% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Express?For American Express, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.03%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that American Express will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Express would post earnings of $2.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.57, delivering a surprise of +8.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American Express appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TJX has been benefiting from its efforts to grow its store and e-commerce operations. The company’s marketing strategy and loyalty programs are also working well. The TJX Companies has been witnessing growth in its pre-tax profit margin for a while now. Management raised its guidance for the fiscal 2023 pre-tax profit margin on its last earnings call.However, it lowered its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance for the fiscal. For fiscal 2023, management envisions the adjusted EPS in the range of $3.05-3.13, lower than the earlier guidance range of $3.13-$3.20. We note that The TJX Companies has been battling elevated cost headwinds, which are likely to persist.Let’s take a closer look at all aspects.UpsidesThe TJX Companies has been benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company increased its store count by 21 to reach 4,736 stores. It increased the square footage by 0.5% quarter over quarter during this time.Earlier, management highlighted that it expects to incur capital expenditure in the range of $1.7-$1.9 billion for fiscal 2023. This will be spent on opening new stores, remodels, relocations and investments in distribution, network as well as infrastructure. The TJX Companies is optimistic about growing its global store base by at least another 1,500 stores in the current locations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe TJX Companies has been witnessing solid demand for an in-person shopping experience in the last few years. Further, with an increasing number of consumers resorting to online shopping, The TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business.We believe that The TJX Companies’ off-price model, along with its strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products, and efficient supply-chain management are likely to aid its performance.The TJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums have been adding growth. Management is sharpening marketing messages in outlets to emphasize value leadership to consumers.Further, the company is strategically targeting pockets of opportunity in specific geographies to boost messaging. The off-price retailer is on track to attract new shoppers of every age, including many Gen Z and millennial shoppers, to fuel growth.The TJX Companies’ second-quarter fiscal 2023 pre-tax profit margin came in at 9.2%, up from the 8.7% reported in the year-ago quarter.  The merchandise margin gained from the solid mark on and pricing initiative but was hurt by incremental freight pressure.The company now expects a fiscal 2023 pre-tax profit margin of 9.3-9.5% and an adjusted pre-tax profit margin of 9.7-9.9%. Earlier, management projected a pre-tax profit margin in the range of 9.2-9.4% and an adjusted pre-tax profit margin in the band of 9.6-9.8%.Story continuesDownsidesThe TJX Companies’ merchandise margin was hurt by incremental freight pressure in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company also witnessed incremental wage costs, which weighed on the pretax profit margin. The TJX Companies saw additional wage costs of 80 basis points (bps).The gross profit margin was 27.6% in the second quarter, down 1.8 percentage points. For fiscal 2023, management projects 140 bps of incremental freight expenses and higher wage costs of 70 bps. For the third quarter, management projects 100 bps of incremental freight expenses and higher wage costs of nearly 80 bps.However, we believe that the abovementioned upsides keep this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company well-placed for growth.

In the last reported quarter, this Brentwood, TN-based company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Tractor Supply Company Price and EPS Surprise Tractor Supply Company Price and EPS SurpriseTractor Supply Company price-eps-surprise | Tractor Supply Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteTractor Supply has been benefiting from its robust e-commerce business, strong demand and strategic growth endeavors. Strength in the Life Out Here Strategy and healthy demand for its product categories have been aiding its top and bottom lines for the past few quarters. Continued sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as strength in seasonal categories, is likely to have boosted the performance in the third quarter.Given the changing consumer trends, the company has been focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience. It is on track with the ‘ONETractor’ strategy to connect store and online shopping. TSCO’s omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website, and the new mobile app. Gains from these efforts are expected to have led to strong e-commerce growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is also expected to have benefited from the progress on its “Life Out Here” strategy and everyday low pricing. Its Neighbor's Club loyalty program has also been boosting sales. Tractor Supply has been on track with the Project Fusion remodels and Side Lot transformation to remain nationally strong and locally relevant by bringing the latest merchandising strategies to life. These have been significant investments toward stores and are expected to have boosted productivity across the existing and new stores.However, TSCO has been witnessing rising inflationary and supply-chain issues. Higher product cost inflation and transportation costs have been hurting Tractor Supply’s gross margin for a while. Elevated costs, stemming from increased wage rates, have been acting as deterrents. The company has been witnessing increased investments in the Life Out Here strategic efforts. These costs are likely to have marred its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Tractor Supply this time around.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 2.37% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.35%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.21%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the oil and gas exploration and production company had gained 4.47% over the past month. This has outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 0.87% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 6.51% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Occidental Petroleum as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be November 8, 2022. On that day, Occidental Petroleum is projected to report earnings of $2.88 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 231.03%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $9.96 billion, up 46.22% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $10.87 per share and revenue of $39.02 billion, which would represent changes of +326.27% and +48.28%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Occidental Petroleum should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

323,2e0bcb27-a0a9-315f-9366-e083d6c6e96a,OXY,2022-10-15,7 Stocks That Could Implode Ahead of the 2022 Midterm Elections,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-could-implode-ahead-150312051.html,1665500592,STORY,"['OXY', 'COIN', 'ARLP', 'XOM', 'CME']","[All signs are pointing to the Republicans winning the majority of the House in the 2022 midterm elections. Still, one or more “October surprises” could materialize that could conceivably prevent the GOP from gaining a majority. So, just in case one or more of those scenarios (such as peace in Ukraine and a sudden deceleration of inflation) do materialize, I’ve prepared this list of seven stocks to sell before the 2022 midterm elections.I’m old enough to remember the 1980s and 1990s. In those days, it was clear that Democrats were the pro-union party and Republicans were the pro-business party. Now those lines have gotten quite blurred, mostly because many Democrats now back some sectors, as much or more than Republicans.Still, there are a few sectors that Democrats are still not too keen on. Among the most prominent names on that list are oil and gas, coal, banks, and cryptos.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind,, here are the seven stocks to sell before the 2022 midterm elections if it suddenly looks as though Democrats will retain control in Washington.XOMExxon Mobil$97.52OXYOccidental Petroleum$63.31ARLPAlliance Resource$23.27COINCoinbase$66.59CMECME Group$170.14MSMorgan Stanley$76.98EZPWEZCORP$7.80Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comThere are two business sectors that divide Democrats and Republicans. That includes the oil and gas sector. The other one, in case you’re curious, is renewable energy. There is still no love lost among the Democrats for domestic oil and gas companies. Consequently, if the Democrats do win control of the House, the party could take actions that would meaningfully hurt U.S. oil and gas companies, including Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM).For example, they could conceivably impose new taxes on the sector, use the Clean Air Act and other laws to further restrict gasoline-powered vehicles, and declare certain parts of the coasts of the continental U.S. off-limits for drilling.Story continuesIf the GOP takes control of the House, it would most likely help XOM and its peers. That’s because Republicans could potentially strike a deal to limit further releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or find a way to get the Biden administration to allow the Keystone Pipeline to be built.The XOM stock, all else being equal, could underperform for some time if it looks as though the Democrats will retain control of both houses of Congress.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)oil pumpsSource: Thaiview / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum’s (NYSE:OXY) drilling programs are largely concentrated largely in America. Indeed, outside of the U.S., OXY appears to only have major drilling operations in three other, relatively small countries: Oman, the UAE, and Columbia. Therefore, any successful efforts by Democrats to restrict drilling for oil in the U.S. and raise taxes on oil producers would likely have much more of an impact on Occidental than on XOM and CVX.Congressional Democrats have even sought to force the Fed to get U.S. banks to stop lending to oil companies. Given Occidental’s large concentration in the U.S., such an initiative would probably have a major, negative impact on Occidental and OXY stock. Meanwhile, on Sept. 12, Citi downgraded its rating on OXY stock to “neutral” from “buy,” citing valuation. OXY stock’s current price of around $63 is less than 10% below the firm’s price target of $67. Heading into the 2022 midterm elections, the OXY stock could potentially take a hit.Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP)A top aerial view of an open pit mine industry, with a big yellow mining truck for coalSource: ShutterstockCoal’s share of the U.S. electricity market has been dropping for years, and that trend looks poised to continue as worries about climate change mount, prompting states and the federal government to embrace an “all-of-the-above-except-coal” approach when it comes to generating electricity. Moreover, very low natural gas prices for much of the last decade has greatly reduced the utilization of coal and coal prices.But this year, everything has changed for the coal sector, including Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ:ARLP). Specifically, due to the events in Europe, natural gas prices in much of the world, including the U.S., have jumped, and the demand for coal has climbed. As a result, ARLP stock has soared 90% this year.However, continued, unified Democratic control of Washington could be quite negative for Alliance Resource Partners and its peers.At least since Barack Obama became the leading Democratic contender for president in 2008, Democrats have been hostile to coal. Indeed, even when the party needed the support of a coal backer, Senator Joe Manchin, to pass its climate and health bill last summer, the Democrats placed provisions within the legislation that will hurt the coal sector. Multiple pro-coal organizations warns that the legislation, which ultimately became law, would “severely threaten American coal.”So if Democrats are in a situation in 2023 in which they no longer depend on Manchin to pass legislation, chances are high that they would take meaningful, additional steps against the U.S. coal sector. Such a development, of course, would be quite negative for ARLP and its peers.Coinbase (COIN)The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.Source: Primakov / Shutterstock.comI’ve written before about Coinbase’s financial woes, noting in a June column that “Coinbase’s (NASDAQ:COIN) financial results have plummeted. ”I’ve also previously warned that the US SEC is conducting two, separate probes of the company. Additionally, the US SEC may decide to classify Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) as a security. Motley Fool columnist Dominic Basulto also warned that such a development “could have disastrous consequences for the future price of Ethereum.”And many other cryptos could suffer similar fates at the hands of the US SEC. Indeed, Basulto noted that “After all, if Ethereum is a security, then so is almost every other crypto, with the possible exception of Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD).”That type of development would have, of course, hugely negative ramifications for Coinbase, the leading crypto brokerage.Multiple Congressional Democrats are also turning against cryptos. For example, a leading liberal voice on Capitol Hill, Senator Elizabeth Warren, has been quite critical of the sector. Heading into the 2022 midterm elections, the COIN stock could potentially take a hit.CME Group (CME)Commodities Economic Goods Assets Stock Market Prices 3d IllustrationSource: iQoncept / Shutterstock.comIf inflation remains a problem and Democrats retain complete control of Washington, they could look to crack down on speculation on commodities. That would be a significant, negative catalyst for CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), which operates exchanges that facilitate the purchases of many commodities, including multiple agricultural commodities.Inflation, of course, has been a major problem for the U.S. fiscally, while weighing on consumers tremendously this year. Inflation has also been a major cause of the Democrats’ political woes.Some on the Left and a number of Congressional Democrats have said that inflation is being at least partially fueled by Wall Street speculators. For example, liberal Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, along with a number of his colleagues, in June urged the Biden administration to eliminate a ” loophole, which lets Wall Street speculators gamble on commodity prices, driving inflation.”The loophole reportedly allows ” big financial firms overwhelm healthy price-setting with massive volumes of commodity-based swaps — essentially bets on commodity prices.”If inflation remains stubbornly high and Democrats retain control of Congress, they could look to rein in speculation by Wall Street traders on commodities, significantly harming CME Group and causing CME stock to decline meaningfully.Morgan Stanley (MS)The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comOf course, restricting Wall Street’s ability to speculate on commodities could lower the profits of Wall Street banks. And investment banks, which get a great deal of their revenue from trading, as opposed to lending, are prime candidates to be hurt by curbs on commodities trading.Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) bills itself as “a market leader in the Commodities sector, providing risk management, investor products, financing solutions and liquidity across commodities markets including oil, metals, power and natural gas.”As a result, MS could be significantly hurt if the Democrats retain control of Congress and decide to rein in the Street’s speculation on commodities.Also worth noting is that the Democrats’ climate and health bill included a 1% tax on companies’ share buyback programs.If the party retains control of Congress, it could decide to levy other, additional taxes on investments, including a financial transaction tax, which has been levied by many European nations, taxes on mergers and acquisitions, and higher capital gains taxes. Such initiatives are likely to cause Morgan Stanley’s clients to reduce their investments, lowering the bank’s profits and weighing on MS stock.EZCORP (EZPW)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7The Obama Administration was quite hostile to payday lenders such as EZCORP (NASDAQ:EZPW). In 2016, the Administration proposed a rule that would have required the company, and its peers to determine if borrowers could repay he companies’ loans which tend to carry high interest rates. The rule would have also prevented the companies from making more than ” two attempts to withdraw money from borrowers’ accounts.” In 2021, Congressional Democrats successfully overturned a rule instituted by the Trump Administration which reportedly would have enabled payday lenders to avoid abiding by states’ limits on interest rates.Given Democrats’ past hostility to the payday loan sector, there’s a good chance that, if they somehow expand their Congressional majorities, they would look to rein in Ezcorp and its peers.Many economists predict that the U.S. will enter a recession within the next year. Since demand for payday loans tends to increase when the economy is doing poorly, a recession could be positive for Ezcorp and EZPW stock. Still, if Democrats look poised to expand their Congressional majorities, I recommend selling the shares of Ezcorp and those of its peers.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer was short COIN.

KR is making stupendous efforts to strengthen its position in the industry. Per media reports, this mega grocery retailer is in discussion to unite with Albertsons Companies ACI to form a new huge US grocery firm. After the merger, both companies can achieve higher scale and leverage on costs, competing better than the biggest grocery dealers.Sources say that this can be a cash-and-stock transaction valuing Albertsons Companies at nearly $25 billion. However, no concluding decisions have come yet. According to sources, a possible deal might attract regulatory scrutiny, as food prices are soaring and causing significant inflation.Kroger continues to deploy capital to concentrate more on remodels, merchandising and other viable projects to overcome competition in the grocery space. In this regard, Kroger’s subsidiary Home Chef (acquired in 2018) offers more than 500 products across various categories, including meal kits, heat-and-eat meals, ready-to-eat products and seasonal meals, among others. This apart, KR’s partnership with British online grocery delivery company Ocado reinforces its position in the online ordering, automated fulfillment and home delivery space.We note that Albertsons Companies remains on track with its earlier announced review of strategic alternatives to enhance growth and maximize stockholder value. ACI’s focus on providing efficient in-store services, enhancing digital and omni-channel capabilities, and increasing productivity are steadily contributing to its upbeat performance.What’s More?Kroger has been making investments for a while to enhance product freshness and quality as well as expand its digital capabilities. Further, it is augmenting the “Our Brands” portfolio by launching products. KR’s digital business remains one of its key drivers, thanks to its Kroger Delivery Now, Boost membership program and the rollout of the customer fulfillment centers. Management remains committed to doubling KR’s digital sales by 2023.KR’s ‘Kroger Delivery Now’ service in collaboration with Instacart provides customers with food and household staples at affordable prices in 30 minutes. It unveiled Kroger Floral in partnership with DoorDash.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals.Is There Enough Growth For Vertex Pharmaceuticals?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Vertex Pharmaceuticals would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 63% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 44% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.8% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.5% per annum, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that Vertex Pharmaceuticals is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E?Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.We've established that Vertex Pharmaceuticals currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.You should always think about risks.

Investors are more than anxious for companies to pull the curtain back, unveiling what has transpired behind the scenes.It’s been a tough year for stocks overall, with a hawkish Fed, geopolitical issues, and lingering COVID-19 uncertainties spoiling the fun all year long.Earlier in the week, we received Q3 2022 results from a titan in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, PepsiCo PEP.PepsiCo is an American multinational beverage, food, and snack corporation headquartered in New York.PepsiCo shares have displayed remarkable relative strength year-to-date, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a wide margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of a B.Let’s take a deeper dive into the quarterly results and see how a few other Consumer Staples titans, such as Coca-Cola KO and Altria Group MO, shape up heading into their respective prints.PepsiCo Q3 2022It was a strong quarter for PepsiCo, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.85 by a solid 6.5% and reporting quarterly earnings of $1.97 per share.Impressively, it was the company’s ninth quarter of exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate out of its last ten.Revenue also exceeded expectations; sales of $21.9 billion easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate of $20.8 billion by more than 5%. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImpressively, the company’s top-line performance was broad-based; its North America and International businesses both delivered 16% organic revenue growth.Further, PEP’s operating profit climbed 11%, and the company’s core operating margin expanded by 30 bp, thanks to the company’s strong revenue growth and cost management initiatives. The company also highlighted the strength of its diversified portfolio and consumer demand trends; PEP’s global beverages and convenience foods businesses delivered 12% and 20% organic revenue growth, respectively. Story continuesFor the cherry on top, the company raised its FY22 guidance.Ramon Laguarta, CEO and Chairman, said, “We are very pleased with our results for the third quarter as our global business momentum remains strong. Given our year-to-date performance, we now expect our full-year organic revenue to increase 12% (previously 10%) and core constant currency earnings per share to increase 10% (previously 8%).”Coca-ColaCoca-Cola is another titan in the Consumer Staples sector, one of PEP’s biggest rivals. As it stands, KO currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the company’s upcoming earnings release on October 25th, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.64 suggests a Y/Y decline of a marginal 1.5%. Over the last 60 days, the $0.64 per share estimate has remained unchanged.Like PEP, Coca-Cola has an impressive earnings track record; KO has exceeded revenue and earnings estimates in its last six quarters.Just in its latest print, the company penciled in a 4.5% bottom-line beat paired with a 5.3% revenue beat.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKO shares currently trade at a 22.7X forward earnings multiple, reflecting a 19% premium relative to its Zacks Consumer Staples sector.While shares trade at a premium relative to their sector, the value is still well below its five-year median of 24.6X and highs of 26.2X in 2021.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHeading into the quarterly print, KO carries an Earnings ESP Score of -0.3%.Altria GroupAltria Group is a world-leading producer and marketer of cigarettes, tobacco, and other similarly related products.

In its latest earnings release, the company posted a marginal 0.8% EPS beat.Top-line results have also been primarily strong, with Altria penciling in six top-line beats over its last ten quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMO’s valuation levels have declined dramatically; the company’s 9.5X forward earnings multiple is below its 10.9X five-year median and represents a sizable 50% discount relative to its Zacks sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHeading into the upcoming print, MO carries an Earnings ESP Score of -1.5%.Bottom LineWith PepsiCo posting strong Q3 results, it raises valid questions surrounding the upcoming earnings releases from Coca-Cola KO and Altria Group MO.PEP experienced strong consumer demand, making it seem reasonable for other Consumer Staples stocks to have witnessed the same.Still, it appears advantageous for investors to heed caution with MO shares currently, as its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates that its near-term earnings outlook is under pressure.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:WM) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 81%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-management-inc-nyse-wm-110039177.html,1665831639,STORY,['WM'],"[Every investor in Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Waste Management. See our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Waste Management does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Waste Management's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Waste Management is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.5% of common stock, and Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Asset Trust holds about 4.5% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Waste Management, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$112m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Waste Management is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

This is partly due to the skepticism surrounding new and innovative companies in the financial sector.However, many undervalued fintech stocks are trading at a discount and offer promising growth prospects in the near term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOne reason to invest in undervalued fintech stocks is that they are often leaders in new and innovative technologies. These companies are well-positioned to benefit from the shift to digital payments, which is expected to accelerate in the coming years.Another reason to invest in undervalued fintech stocks is that they tend to be more nimble than their larger counterparts. For example, when the major banks began implementing strict new regulations following the financial crisis, many small fintech startups could take advantage of the resulting confusion and seize market share.If you’re looking for stocks with high upside potential, undervalued fintech stocks should be on your radar.

In the forecast period (2022-2030), a compound annual growth rate of 45% is expected.For the full fiscal year 2022, Affirm reported revenue of $1.3 billion, a tiny slice of the overall market. Therefore, Affirm is not done growing as yet.The only issue for Affirm is its losses in a bearish market. Even the best fintech companies, with several years of profitability behind them, cannot err when it comes to earnings in the current environment.The markets, therefore, have been brutal to the stock, and it doesn’t look like things will change anytime soon.However, the positive is that the stock is available at a discount. In the year thus far, shares have shed more than 60% in value, which is why it’s on this list of undervalued fintech stocks to buy.Coinbase (COIN)The app for Coinbase (COIN) displayed on an iPhone screen.Source: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.comCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is a digital currency exchange and wallet service where you can shop using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD), and Litecoin (LTC-USD).It has an intuitive interface, user-friendly customer service, and advanced security features.

Coinbase had 98 million registered users at the beginning of 2022.

It has allowed people to invest in cryptocurrency without purchasing entire coins. This has opened up a whole new world of investment opportunities for people who previously could not invest in cryptocurrency.Under the circumstances, Coinbase is doing the best it can. It got regulatory approval in the Netherlands and easily handled some minor tech snafus to ensure the platform was robust. Since the company’s fortunes remain intimately tied to the crypto market, it is relatively riskier than some of the other names on this list.Robinhood (HOOD)Robinhood app logo seen on smartphone on US dollar banknotesSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.comRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) is an online broker that offers commission-free trading on stocks, ETFs, and options.

If you want to read about some more LNG and LNG shipping stocks, go directly to the 5 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy Now.According to Shell LNG Outlook 2022 report, global trade in LNG climbed 6% to 380 million tonnes in 2021 as several nations recovered from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the demand for LNG grew fastest in China and South Korea. China surpassed Japan to become the world's top LNG importer after increasing its LNG imports by 12 million tonnes to 79 million tonnes. From a supply perspective, LNG exports increased in 2021 despite several unforeseen outages that reduced the amount of LNG available for delivery. With a 24 million tonne rise year over year, the USA dominated export growth and is predicted to surpass all other LNG exporters in 2022. It is anticipated that the worldwide LNG market will remain competitive in the near future, with a supply-demand gap predicted to materialize in the middle of the current decade.According to Shell, global LNG demand is anticipated to reach 700 million tonnes annually by 2040, up 90% from the demand in 2021. The majority of this growth is anticipated to be consumed by Asia as local gas production drops, regional economies expand, and LNG replaces higher-emission energy sources, addressing concerns about air quality and advancing toward carbon reduction objectives. It is expected that Asia will continue to drive LNG demand growth through 2040, accounting for 70% of all increases. China added 20 million tonnes per year of term contracts as evidence of the significance of ensuring adequate energy supplies to advance toward its 2060 carbon-neutral ambition.Following a projected 6% increase in 2021, Bloomberg predicted that LNG demand would increase by 5% to roughly 399 million tonnes in 2022. According to Reuters, as market players attempt to secure cargoes for the winter demand amid rising LNG prices and a dearth of global supply, tanker rates to transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) are anticipated to stay firm. After the conflict in Ukraine and a significant outage at an important U.S. plant Freeport LNG reduced U.S. LNG supplies, the global LNG market lately became even more competitive, forcing participants to obtain vessels for longer-term contracts that may go as long as a year. In July of this year, pricing firm Spark Commodities estimated LNG freight spot costs for the Atlantic at $46,750 per day and for the Pacific at $55,500 per day. The forward LNG freight rates, as indicated by Spark Commodities, however, were $156,000 per day for the fourth quarter of 2022, up from $65,916 per day for the third quarter and from $22,865 per day for the first quarter. Longer-term LNG freight was estimated to cost $95,917 per day on average in 2023, averaging $86,000 per day from 2019 to 2021.Story continuesSome of the elite players in the LNG and LNG shipping market include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).10 best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy NowOleksandr Kalinichenko / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We selected the best LNG and LNG shipping stocks based on their current or future LNG projects, positive analyst coverage, and potential for higher scalability in the future. We have arranged the list of the best LNG and LNG shipping stocks according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. The hedge fund sentiment was assessed from Insider Monkey’s database of elite hedge funds, tracked as of the second quarter of 2022.10. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 25The company was formerly known as IPL Energy Inc. and changed its name to Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) in October 1998. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) was founded in 1949 and is headquartered in Calgary, Canada. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) operates as an energy infrastructure company. It is one of the highest-yielding dividend companies, with a dividend yield of 7.41% as of October 13. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) has paid dividends to its shareholders for over 67 years. In terms of Canadian dollars, it has steadily grown dividends over the course of its history, resulting in an average compound annual growth rate of 10% for dividends over the past 27 years. The latest increase came in December 2021, with a 3% increase in dividends to C$0.86 per common share per quarter, translating into C$3.44 per share on an annualized basis.On September 12, Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) was upgraded by Raymond James analyst Michael Shaw to Outperform from Market Perform with a C$60 price target, up from C$57. Shaw informs investors in a research report that while the equity has been drifting lower, with share currently trading 8.7% below its 2022 high established in June, Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) fundamental outlook has only become better with the passage of time. Shaw claims that Enbridge's prognosis for short- and medium-term growth has improved as the company has continued to follow a balanced capital allocation plan.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 25 hedge funds were long Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 24 funds in the earlier quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the leading shareholder of the company, with approximately 52 million shares worth $2.18 billion.Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We are meaningfully overweight energy, particularly within North American energy infrastructure. Enbridge and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”09. Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 27Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) was founded in 1946 and is based in Hamilton, Bermuda. Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) designs, builds, owns, and operates marine infrastructure for the liquefaction and regasification of LNG. As of December 31, 2021, it operated nine LNG carriers, one FSRU, and three FLNGs.The huge increase in LNG consumption opens up growth possibilities for the company and it can benefit greatly from it till the end of 2030. Due to the strengthening of its balance sheet, the company will be able to explore these development opportunities aggressively. On September 29, BofA analyst Ken Hoexter raised the stock's rating from Neutral to Buy with a price target of $29, up from $23, noting that shares have pulled back by almost 20% since August 25. According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) was part of 27 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 31 funds in the last quarter. William B. Gray’s Orbis Investment Management is the leading position holder in the company, with approximately 11 million shares worth $250 million.Alongwith Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) is one of the best LNG stocks to buy now.Here is what RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund &amp; RiverPark Strategic Income Fund has to say about Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Golar LNG Ltd. is a lessor and operator of liquefied natural gas (LNG) transport ships, floating natural gas liquefying systems (FLNGs) and a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU). LNG ships take on natural gas that has been cooled into a liquid state to permit transport to distant ports for re-gasification and distribution. The FLNGs, positioned near offshore gas production wells, efficiently liquefy natural gas on-site using cold seawater, avoiding the need for pipelines linked to on-shore liquefaction facilities. The FSRU stores LNG and has onboard facilities that convert LNG back into its gaseous state. Comfortable with the quality of the company’s hard assets and confident that cash flow from operations would permit deleveraging, in October 2021, we participated in the new issuance of Golar’s 7% unsecured bonds due 2025. The new issue proceeds were used to repay their convertible bond due in February 2022. At that time, leverage net of cash was 6.6x and leverage net of cash and equity investments was 4.8x…” (Click here to see the full text)08. Sempra (NYSE:SRE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 29The company was formerly known as Sempra Energy and changed its name to Sempra in July 2021. Sempra (NYSE:SRE) was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in San Diego, California. Sempra (NYSE:SRE) operates as an energy-services holding company in the United States and internationally.

The dividend is distributable on October 15, to shareholders of the company as of September 23. The company had a forward dividend yield of 3.12% on October 13.Due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the supply of natural gas to Europe is badly disturbed. Sempra (NYSE:SRE) can exploit this situation and it has already started doing so by signing three contracts with customers in Europe for the supply of American LNG. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 29 hedge funds held stakes worth $285.3 million in Sempra (NYSE:SRE) at the end of June 2022, up from 23 funds in the prior quarter worth $209 million.

The conflict and economic sanctions against Russia have brought to the forefront EU dependence on Russian oil and natural gas. As Germany and its EU neighbors look to diversify their natural gas suppliers, some U.S. companies stand to benefit. Within the portfolio, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is well-positioned. Sempra’s previously underappreciated portfolio of infrastructure assets, with existing as well as prospective liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities, should benefit from renewed interest in U.S.-sourced LNG. The U.S. commitment to increase LNG exports to Europe over the coming years should create a favorable long-term demand environment and hopefully regulatory framework benefiting Sempra along with other natural gas and LNG suppliers. Sempra’s core utilities operations in California and Texas continue to generate solid mid- to high-single-digit earnings growth, and it enjoys additional growth opportunities from renewable natural gas (RNG), hydrogen and other renewable sources of energy.”07. South Jersey Industries, Inc. (NYSE:SJI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 33South Jersey Industries, Inc. (NYSE:SJI) was founded in 1910 and is headquartered in Folsom, New Jersey. South Jersey Industries, Inc. (NYSE:SJI), through its subsidiaries, provides energy-related products and services. The company engages in the purchase, transmission, and sale of natural gas.

(NYSE:SJI), down from 36 in the preceding quarter. These stakes have a total value of $582.5 million. Just like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), South Jersey Industries, Inc. (NYSE:SJI) is one of the best LNG stocks to buy now.First Pacific Advisors mentioned South Jersey Industries, Inc. (NYSE:SJI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“South Jersey Industries, Inc. (NYSE:SJI) shares rose 40% on Feb. 24, 2022, on news that Infrastructure Investment Funds, a private equity fund managed by JP Morgan Investment Management, would take the company private. The deal is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter of 2022.”06. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 39The company was formerly known as Royal Dutch Shell plc and changed its name to Shell plc in January 2022. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) was founded in 1907 and is located in London, United Kingdom. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) operates as an energy and petrochemical company in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, the United States, and the rest of the Americas. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), like other all-energy majors, is actively working toward achieving net-zero greenhouse emissions by the year 2050.According to experts, Shell plc's (NYSE:SHEL) balance sheet is strong and its debt load is reasonable. On September 12, Ryan Todd, an analyst at Piper Sandler, raised his price target for Shell from $75 to $80 while maintaining an Overweight rating for the stock. The analyst maintains a positive outlook for integrated oils, stating that near-record distillate margins are still expected to boost refining forecasts over the winter and into an ""equally tight"" 2023. Todd finds no shift in strategic priorities across his upstream coverage, despite some upside risk to upstream cost inflation.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were long Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the leading stake in the company, consisting of 20.25 million shares worth over $1 billion.Here’s what Third Point Management said about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We have continued to add to our position in Shell, as it trades at the same deeply discounted multiple today that it did last year due to a move up in commodity prices. We are engaged in discussions with management, board members, and other shareholders, as well as informal talks with financial advisors. We have discussed various alternatives with the aim of both increasing shareholder value and allowing Shell to effectively manage the energy transition. We have reiterated our view that Shell’s portfolio of disparate businesses ranging from deep water oil to wind farms to gas stations to chemical plants is confusing and unmanageable. Most investors we have discussed this with agree that the company would be more successful over the long term with a different corporate structure. Discussions among the parties have been constructive and will be ongoing since stakeholders clearly see these corporate changes as instrumental, particularly if Shell wishes to become a leader in the energy transition rather than be left behind as a tarnished legacy brand.Beyond our discussions around corporate structure, there have been two important developments since our last update. First, Shell announced a plan to redomicile its headquarters to the UK and create a single shareholder class. This move allows greater flexibility to modify its portfolio (either through asset sales or spin-offs) and allows for a more efficient return of capital, specifically via share repurchases. Second, fundamental and geopolitical events have highlighted the strategic importance of reliable energy supplies, especially in Europe. Shell’s LNG business, the largest in the world outside of Qatar, will play a critical role in ensuring energy security for Europe. In our view, the value of this business has increased dramatically since our original investment.While Shell continues to trade at a large discount to its intrinsic value, with proper management we believe the company can simultaneously deliver shareholder returns, reliable energy and decarbonization of the global economy. We look forward to continued engagement with management and other shareholders and to more strategic clarity from the Company.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles:Top 10 ETFs for Beginners11 Best Cyclical Stocks To Buy11 Best Cruise Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 10 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Vulcan Materials is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.074 = US$967m ÷ (US$14b - US$1.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, Vulcan Materials has an ROCE of 7.4%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Basic Materials industry average of 9.4%. View our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Vulcan Materials compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Vulcan Materials' ROCE Trend?In terms of Vulcan Materials' historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly demand attention. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 7.4% and the business has deployed 47% more capital into its operations. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.The Bottom LineLong story short, while Vulcan Materials has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 28% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Story continuesVulcan Materials does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Vulcan Materials  that you might be interested in.While Vulcan Materials isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

This will enable Brazil to manage its renewable-rich grid and its growing utilization of non-dispatchable energy sources. The power plant will support growth of intermittent power from solar, hydro (without reservoirs) and wind resources, which will likely be beneficial to the country generating nearly 70% of its power from renewable energy sources.Construction of the new reserve power plant near Manaus will start in late 2022. The facility will likely commence its commercial operations by 2026. The available installed capacity will help the National Grid Operator ensure grid stability with high efficiency. Also, the average electricity cost in the country will be reduced by the increased power availability in the open electricity marketplace.GE stands to benefit from strong performances of its Aerospace and Healthcare segments owing to increased demand in the quarters ahead. Also, its investments in productivity and innovation should fuel growth going forward.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GE’s 2022 earnings per share is currently pegged at $2.71, suggesting growth of 27.8% from the year-ago reported figure.

President Biden has suggested a review of the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is, of course, a longtime Washington ally. The move by the oil-producing group stands in direct conflict with Biden's goal of ensuring lower prices for US consumers. And this coming just weeks before the all-important midterms here.The US says the Saudis presented no market basis for the cuts. Let's get to Regina Mayor, KPMG's global head of Clients and Markets. Regina, good to talk to you today. Let's start on that comment that we got from President Biden saying there's no market basis. And yet, you look at where oil is trading right now. We're right back below the levels we were at when that OPEC-plus cuts decision was first made. So I mean, what does that suggest in terms of where the real fears are? At the end of the day, is it about a potential global recession and a significant pullback in demand?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think the market reacted to the headline of the figure of 2 million barrel per day cut when the reality is that OPEC is producing 3 and 1/2 million barrels per day lower than their stated production quotas. So I saw it more as just a realization, an acknowledgment of what's actually happening on the ground. The one thing that was important was the Saudis are starting to signal that they don't have spare capacity. But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw over the summer.Now, the price is coming back down to Earth because I think, as you mentioned before the break, the demand side pressures, or there's a lot of uncertainty. China's still not come back fully online. There's lots of concerns now about what COVID could do over the winter. We're worried about a recession. So I think that's brought the price back down. But we saw a nearly 20% jump in WTI just in the last two weeks. And now, I think it's coming back down to a more realistic price projection.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Specifically on the supply side, we had so many oil analysts come out on the back of that OPEC-plus decision saying essentially, look, despite this announcement of 2 million barrels cut a day, at the end of the day, most of these OPEC numbers do not meet their quotas. I mean, what's the realistic number we should be looking at in terms of how much comes offline as a result of this decision?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think the real number that I was looking at is about 800,000 barrels per day because I just looked at what the reductions were from Saudi, Kuwait, and the UAE. So those are parts of the world that do have spare capacity. And when I visit the region, you hear different things from the different executives. So that was what the real cut was. But the EIA is forecasting that the US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023.So I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have the supply that we need, especially if we face into a reduced demand environment. If we see a really severe winter, and we don't see the-- and we don't see the recession that folks are expecting-- we see demand continue to spike, then we're going to see a lot of upward pressure on price.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about where those prices could move. I mean, you pointed to some demand concerns there, especially coming out of China. We're all watching to see what kind of messaging comes from this party Congress over in China from President Xi specifically on the economy. But you said we're still talking about a tight supply here. So when you say upward pressure, how much more upside do you see going into the winter?REGINA MAYOR: I worry a lot about a potential big spike in the winter. If we have a really, really cold winter, that's where I think we could see prices back close to 100, maybe even in triple digits. But I'm hedging against that. I really think the prices are closer to where they should be. I've said WTI and Brent should be in the 80s. That was what OPEC-plus was trying to do is shore the price back up because they saw the market potentially overreacting to some of the demand concerns and not paying enough attention to the supply. So I think that's in part what drove their 2 million barrel per day headline cut, which is just making transparent to the rest of the world what was actually going on.AKIKO FUJITA: And Regina, I know you can't speak to specifically sort of the political environment in all of this. But it does feel like there are increasing lines being drawn geopolitically when you think about what happened between Saudi Arabia/Russia, OPEC, and the US. You know, you've got the Western European countries and pushing their sanctions as well against Russia. I mean, at the end of all of this, wherever that end may be, how is the oil market going to look? I mean, how fragmented do you think things could get?REGINA MAYOR: Well, I think, Akiko, the thing that has always surprised me is there's four fundamentals of how countries and markets need to manage energy. And that first and foremost is energy security. Second is affordability. Third is reliability. Fourth is sustainability. No doubt, the climate agenda is huge, and we are facing a climate crisis. But the world was focusing more on number four.There's almost like a Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have the energy that you need and it's not affordable and it's not reliable, then governments and policymakers need to get very heavily involved. And so that's how I would characterize what we're seeing today is the realization-- your previous guest talked about the '70s. I'm a child of the '70s. I remember long gas lines during oil embargoes. We're relearning the lessons from decades ago. And hopefully, we do a better time this time around.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, a lot of people kind of drawing parallels looking back in time in history right now with so much going on. KPMG's global head of Clients &amp; Markets. Regina Mayor, good to have you on today.]"

Retail sales data also indicated resilience among consumers.""You get that University of Michigan data to say that maybe we are going to see those inflation expectations rising, and the Fed really wants to front-run inflation expectations, they understand monetary policy doesn’t operate mechanically, it operates more psychologically through expectations, so they want to make sure those expectations stay firmly planted around 2% to 2.5%,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.On Thursday, a reading on consumer prices (CPI) showed inflation remained stubbornly high.Fed officials have been largely in sync when commenting on the need to raise rates and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said in a Reuters interview the recent CPI data warrants a continued ""frontloading"" through larger three-quarter-percentage point steps, although that does not necessarily mean rates need to be raised above the central bank's most recent projections.According to preliminary data, the S&amp;P 500 lost 84.18 points, or 2.29%, to end at 3,585.73 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 325.82 points, or 3.06%, to 10,323.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 368.69 points, or 1.23%, to 29,670.03.Story continuesCorporate earnings season started to pick up steam and helped lift the bank index as one of the few bright spots on the session after quarterly results from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Citigroup Inc, and Wells Fargo &amp; Co boosted the shares of each.""The message I got from them is things are looking pretty good from an economic perspective despite the challenges but they increased loan-loss reserves just in anticipation that you are going to see some more slowing,"" said Jacobsen.UnitedHealth gained, one of the few Dow components to move higher after the health insurer posted better-than-expected quarterly results while raising its annual forecast.Analysts now expect third-quarter profits for S&amp;P 500 companies to have risen just 3.6% from a year ago, much lower than an 11.1% increase expected at the start of July, according to Refinitiv data.Kroger Co shares dropped after the supermarket chain said it would buy smaller rival Albertsons Companies Inc in a $24.6 billion deal.Tesla Inc slumped following media reports that the electric vehicle maker has put on hold plans to launch battery cell production at its plant outside Berlin due to technical issues.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Automatic Data Processing with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing How Fast Is Automatic Data Processing Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Automatic Data Processing has grown EPS by 10% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of Automatic Data Processing's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note Automatic Data Processing achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 9.9% to US$16b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Automatic Data Processing's forecast profits?Are Automatic Data Processing Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$95b company like Automatic Data Processing. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$86m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Does Automatic Data Processing Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Automatic Data Processing is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Passenger unit revenues for the to-be-reported quarter are expected to increase roughly 45% from the year-ago reported figure, driven by upbeat domestic air-travel demand (mainly for leisure) and the gradual recovery in international travel.Reflecting bullish air-travel demand, GOL’s consolidated traffic in September increased 41.4% from the year-ago level. That story was covered in detail in the previous week’s write-up.4. In September 2022, Copa Holdings’ traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 3.5% to 1.75 billion from the comparable period’s level in 2019. Increased passenger volume led to this upside. To match upbeat demand, CPA is increasing capacity — measured in available seat miles (ASMs) — which inched up 1.2% from the 2019 level to 2 billion. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 200 basis points (bps) to 86.9% in the last month.5. United Airlines reportedly decided to add flights to Australian cities with the relaxation of COVID-related travel restrictions and the surge in air-travel demand. UAL plans to fly nonstop from San Francisco International Airport to Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney; from Los Angeles International Airport to Melbourne and Sydney; and from Houston to Sydney.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that all airline stocks, apart from Gol Linhas, have traded in the green over the five trading days.

(NASDAQ:AAL) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/54-ownership-american-airlines-group-144319536.html,1665758599,STORY,['AAL'],"[If you want to know who really controls American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 54% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of American Airlines Group. Check out our latest analysis for American Airlines Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Airlines Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.American Airlines Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of American Airlines Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in American Airlines Group. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of American Airlines GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in American Airlines Group Inc.. Insiders own US$88m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 45% stake in American Airlines Group. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - American Airlines Group has   3 warning signs  (and 2 which are a bit concerning)  we think you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport but overlooked Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the region's busiest hubs, Bloomberg reports.The U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin sought metrics illustrating changes within the two carriers' fleets and routes serving New York City and Boston before and since their Northeast Alliance took effect in early 2021.He also asked for a list of the agreement's key provisions.Senior airline executives from competitors testified that the alliance made it harder for them to compete in Boston and New York.The Justice Department sued American and JetBlue in 2021, terming the alliance as a ""merger"" that increased fares with reduced choice for passengers.Price Action: AAL shares traded higher by 0.92% at $13.17 in the premarket on the last check Friday.See more from BenzingaBankruptcy Judge Ruled In Support Of $375M Creditor Lawsuit Against Morgan StanleyNutanix Weighs Strategic Options Following Takeover ProposalDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Adding to the uncertainty, recent midterm elections failed to deliver a clear mandate for either party. Investors are rightfully nervous about how the market will look going into 2023. Those looking to sleep well at night regardless of the latest political and economic developments should consider investing in dividend stocks for passive income.In a downturn, you might reasonably question how safe a company’s payout is given the worsening economic outlook. However, all seven of the names below are Dividend Aristocrats, meaning they have raised their payouts annually for at least 25 consecutive years — a period covering the dot-com bust and the Great Recession. In other words, these companies have proven they can prosper in difficult times and not just maintain, but increase their dividend. So, there’s a good chance they can weather the current turmoil as well.The names on today’s list of the best dividend stocks for passive income all have a yield of at least 3%, offering a strong starting point in addition to any future dividend increases.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsXOMExxon Mobil$110.50IBMInternational Business Machines$141.23VFCV.F. Corporation$29.93CVXChevron$181.30CLXClorox$143.98KMBKimberly-Clark$127.78ORealty Income$65.37Dividend Stocks for Passive Income: Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comShares of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) sold off in the wake of the midterm election results. Investors hoping for a so-called red wave were disappointed as Republicans failed to notch some expected wins. This, in turn, may bring a tougher regulatory environment for oil and gas companies for at least the next two years.Investors shouldn’t be too worried, though. For one, Exxon Mobil has always operated on a generational time frame. The company is known for investing on a decades-long timescale and consistently puts capital to work when others are shying away. This contrarian streak showed itself, for example, when Exxon Mobil kept investing in its huge offshore Guyana field even as rivals slashed new oil and gas production spending. Once the price of oil surged again in 2021, the successful Guyana bet put Exxon Mobil in the driver’s seat among major international oil producers.Story continuesAll that to say that short-term regulatory developments during one congressional term aren’t enough to meaningfully slow Exxon Mobil down. Additionally, more regulation could lead to less output, and, in turn, higher prices. Further government efforts to restrict new oil and gas production could, counterintuitively, make Exxon Mobil’s existing production capacity even more valuable.In any case, XOM stock is a steal here trading at 9.3 times earnings with a current dividend yield of 3.3%.IBM (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAfter a decade of watching mega-cap technology stocks soar, it would have seemed crazy to think about buying IBM (NYSE:IBM). After all, the staid technology company seemed to have missed major technological trends and was struggling to maintain even flat revenue while the rest of the tech sector soared. With 2022’s turn of events, however, IBM’s appeal has returned.Simply put, IBM stock is so cheap that it doesn’t rely on future growth or high expectations. The company’s primary lines of business in providing tech consulting, information technology services and the like are not fast-moving, but they are consistent. IBM has established deep, persistent relationships, in many cases spanning decades, with leading Fortune 500 companies. These don’t go away overnight.IBM is far from dynamic at this point, but simply keeping the ship steady is enough with shares yielding 4.8%. Meanwhile, don’t discount future growth. The Red Hat acquisition greatly broadened IBM’s push into the hybrid cloud. Indeed, IBM’s cloud computing offering, while trailing the big three, has gained some traction with major customers in recent quarters.IBM has its issues, but those are fully reflected in its bargain valuation.Dividend Stocks for Passive Income: V.F. Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comV.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a large apparel company that owns more than a dozen different brands and trademarks, including Vans, The North Face, Dickies, Timberland and JanSport. V.F. covers a wide variety of demographics but is particularly focused on leisure and outdoor apparel.Investors may rightly shy away from apparel stocks given that this tends to be a cutthroat industry with thin profit margins subject to fickle consumer tastes. However, V.F.’s unique approach reduces this risk. The company’s large stable of different brands helps ensure that there is something that is always on-trend and gaining appeal with consumers at any given time. Right now, for example, while Vans is in a slump, The North Face products are selling well.VFC stock has lost 70% of its value since hitting its all-time high above $100 in early 2020. Profits have dipped a bit in 2022 as consumer spending has started to roll over and inventory levels have mounted. Regardless, the market has overreacted. V.F. Corporation has been through recessions before and can make it through this one as well.With its most recent dividend hike in October, V.F. Corporation left the Dividend Aristocrats and became a Dividend King — a company that has increased its annual payout for 5o or more consecutive years. VFC stock currently yields 7.6%.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) finds itself in a similar situation to Exxon Mobil, with some investors selling off shares thanks to the recent election results. However, long-term investors can profit from the political jitters. The truth is that profits for the major oil and gas producers with a global operations footprint simply aren’t that impacted by minor regulatory changes in the United States, at least not in the short run.Meanwhile, the world needs more energy. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a good deal of oil and natural gas supplies have gone off the market. This makes it much harder for continental Europe to power itself. Demand for liquified natural gas, or LNG, has soared to help ensure that the lights stay on and people stay warm during the harsh European winter.CVX stock is trading near its all-time high, which might make investors think they’ve missed the opportunity. Yet, shares still trade for less than 11.5 times forward earnings and offer a 3.2% dividend yield. And earnings should continue to grow thanks to strong energy demand along with the company’s share buyback program, which increases the amount of earnings per remaining outstanding share.Dividend Stocks for Passive Income: Clorox (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comClorox (NYSE:CLX) surprised a lot of investors over the past few years. Typically, people think of consumer staples stocks as being among the most consistent and least volatile. Yet, between November 2019 and August 2020, CLX stock soared as much as 66% as people rushed to stock up on cleaning supplies amid the early months of the pandemic.But it soon became clear people had way more bleach and other products than they could use in any reasonable time frame. This led to a slump in Clorox’s product sales as people simply haven’t needed to keep buying as many cleaning goods lately. Throw in inflation and supply chain issues and Clorox has gone from boom to bust in record time. Today, shares are once again trading at pre-pandemic levels.However, this downturn won’t last forever. Ultimately, sales of bleach and its other products will return to normal pre-pandemic levels and Clorox will get its profit margins back to typical levels. Meanwhile, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures will cool off sooner or later. And Clorox has been pushing through price hikes that will raise revenue considerably going forward.All told, investors can pick up this classic defensive blue-chip company at a discounted price thanks to the temporary earnings shortfall. And they can take comfort in the stock’s 3.4% yield while they wait.Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters’ main entrance.Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is a fellow consumer staples company that has faced a similar trajectory to Clorox. Kimberly-Clark’s outlook soared in 2020 as people raced to pick up additional toilet paper and bathroom supplies at the start of the pandemic. However, as the rate at which people use toilet paper, soap and other such essentials didn’t actually change much, this sales lift quickly disappeared. Throw in a major inflationary wave, and Kimberly-Clark’s earnings have come up short of expectations.But the company should have a swift road to recovery. When the cost of key inputs, such as wood pulp, stabilizes, it will put the company on better near-term footing. In the meantime, management continues to raise prices to offset the effect of higher costs.Analysts forecast the company’s earnings will decline 9% in 2022 to $5.62 per share, but the decline should be short-lived. As demand normalizes, earnings should come back quickly. Analysts predict a 12.6% earnings jump to $6.33 per share next year, which would result in a forward P/E ratio of 20.2 for this quality blue chip source of passive income. KMB stock currently yields 3.7%.Dividend Stocks for Passive Income: Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) has a compelling message for dividend stock investors: It labeled itself “The Monthly Dividend Company.” Realty has paid a monthly dividend since 1994 and is known for raising that payout amount several times each year.How does Realty Income manage to provide investors with a strong, consistent yield? It is a real estate investment trust and one specifically in the triple net lease category. These tend to be lower risk for landlords since the tenants are responsible for major expenses such as utilities.Like most other areas of the market, REITs have come under significant pressure in 2022. This is because they are tied to interest rates. Investors tend to demand a higher dividend yield from their REITs when the interest rates on comparable fixed-income alternatives such as government Treasury bonds increase. However, this is not a reflection of the quality of Realty Income’s business and has more to do with broader market conditions.In any case, Realty Income has increased its dividend for more than 25 years in a row, and it has good odds of making it through the current downturn without any major disruption in the business plan. Shares currently yield 4.7%.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in IBM, VFC, and XOM stock.

First up, a mega-deal in the grocery space-- Kroger reaching a deal to buy Albertsons for $24.6 billion. The combined company is going to employ more than 700,000 people across about 5,000 stores.Take a look at the movement that we saw. News yesterday that a deal was imminent sent shares of Albertsons above $28 per share, although it looks like it was a buy, the rumor, sell the news type of deal. Also questions about whether or not this is going to be approved from regulators. I think that's a big driver in the stock price today. You see Albertsons closing the day off just around 8.5% on a two-day basis. You're still looking at a gain of just around 2%. Kroger on an intraday basis closing the day off 7%.All right, let's take a look at Pepsi now, the company kicking off third-quarter earnings season on a pretty upbeat note here on a five-day chart. You can see that share's up just around 5%, the company beating on both the top and the bottom lines, also raising its guidance defying any fears of a slowdown, sending shares up about 4% on Wednesday.Taking a look at that five-day chart, you can see the pop in shares shortly after Pepsi did report. Now, third quarter revenue jumping 9% from a year ago, while profit expanded more than 20%. Pepsi now sees full-year revenue growth of 12%. The latest raise marked the third time that the company has actually upped its full-year forecast this year. And again, that week-to-date performance here with shares closing up just over 5%.All right, let's round it out with Delta. Now, the stock jumping, a third-quarter profit of $695 million, as higher fares helped offset some of those rising jet fuel prices. Now, the carrier offered upbeat fourth-quarter guidance, too, noting a resurgence in corporate travel, and also signs of a strong holiday rush. A bullish note from Cowen sending shares up once again today. You see the stock on a daily basis, at least, closing up just around 2%, that five-day gain there for Delta up nearly 6%, and really setting the tone from what we could see from some of those larger carriers.]"

Investors are more than anxious for companies to pull the curtain back, unveiling what has transpired behind the scenes.It’s been a tough year for stocks overall, with a hawkish Fed, geopolitical issues, and lingering COVID-19 uncertainties spoiling the fun all year long.Earlier in the week, we received Q3 2022 results from a titan in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, PepsiCo PEP.PepsiCo is an American multinational beverage, food, and snack corporation headquartered in New York.PepsiCo shares have displayed remarkable relative strength year-to-date, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a wide margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of a B.Let’s take a deeper dive into the quarterly results and see how a few other Consumer Staples titans, such as Coca-Cola KO and Altria Group MO, shape up heading into their respective prints.PepsiCo Q3 2022It was a strong quarter for PepsiCo, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.85 by a solid 6.5% and reporting quarterly earnings of $1.97 per share.Impressively, it was the company’s ninth quarter of exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate out of its last ten.Revenue also exceeded expectations; sales of $21.9 billion easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate of $20.8 billion by more than 5%. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImpressively, the company’s top-line performance was broad-based; its North America and International businesses both delivered 16% organic revenue growth.Further, PEP’s operating profit climbed 11%, and the company’s core operating margin expanded by 30 bp, thanks to the company’s strong revenue growth and cost management initiatives. The company also highlighted the strength of its diversified portfolio and consumer demand trends; PEP’s global beverages and convenience foods businesses delivered 12% and 20% organic revenue growth, respectively. Story continuesFor the cherry on top, the company raised its FY22 guidance.Ramon Laguarta, CEO and Chairman, said, “We are very pleased with our results for the third quarter as our global business momentum remains strong. Given our year-to-date performance, we now expect our full-year organic revenue to increase 12% (previously 10%) and core constant currency earnings per share to increase 10% (previously 8%).”Coca-ColaCoca-Cola is another titan in the Consumer Staples sector, one of PEP’s biggest rivals. As it stands, KO currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the company’s upcoming earnings release on October 25th, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.64 suggests a Y/Y decline of a marginal 1.5%. Over the last 60 days, the $0.64 per share estimate has remained unchanged.Like PEP, Coca-Cola has an impressive earnings track record; KO has exceeded revenue and earnings estimates in its last six quarters.Just in its latest print, the company penciled in a 4.5% bottom-line beat paired with a 5.3% revenue beat.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKO shares currently trade at a 22.7X forward earnings multiple, reflecting a 19% premium relative to its Zacks Consumer Staples sector.While shares trade at a premium relative to their sector, the value is still well below its five-year median of 24.6X and highs of 26.2X in 2021.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHeading into the quarterly print, KO carries an Earnings ESP Score of -0.3%.Altria GroupAltria Group is a world-leading producer and marketer of cigarettes, tobacco, and other similarly related products. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an overall VGM Score of a C.For the company’s upcoming quarterly print on October 27th, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.31 suggests Y/Y earnings growth of 7.4%.Further, both earnings estimate revisions from analysts that have come in over the last several months have been downwards.Altria has primarily exceeded bottom-line estimates, surpassing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in seven of its last ten prints. In its latest earnings release, the company posted a marginal 0.8% EPS beat.Top-line results have also been primarily strong, with Altria penciling in six top-line beats over its last ten quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMO’s valuation levels have declined dramatically; the company’s 9.5X forward earnings multiple is below its 10.9X five-year median and represents a sizable 50% discount relative to its Zacks sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHeading into the upcoming print, MO carries an Earnings ESP Score of -1.5%.Bottom LineWith PepsiCo posting strong Q3 results, it raises valid questions surrounding the upcoming earnings releases from Coca-Cola KO and Altria Group MO.PEP experienced strong consumer demand, making it seem reasonable for other Consumer Staples stocks to have witnessed the same.Still, it appears advantageous for investors to heed caution with MO shares currently, as its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates that its near-term earnings outlook is under pressure.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. It has returned a market beating 72% in that time.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Union Pacific managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 11% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Union Pacific has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Union Pacific, it has a TSR of 91% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Union Pacific shares lost 12% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 25%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 14% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

This company, which is in the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This railroad has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.34%.For the most recent quarter, Union Pacific was expected to post earnings of $2.82 per share, but it reported $2.93 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.90%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.55 per share, while it actually produced $2.57 per share, a surprise of 0.78%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Union Pacific, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Union Pacific currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.68%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 20, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

383,2467349b-26fe-3f1d-abba-11d82421f784,DGX,2022-10-15,Quest Diagnostics (DGX) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-dgx-report-q3-162304597.html,1665764584,STORY,"['DGX', 'MCK']","[Quest Diagnostics Incorporated DGX is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 20, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.36 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.42%. Its earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 12.06%.Factors at PlayQuest Diagnostics is likely to have benefited from the continued sales rebound in the non-COVID base business as economic activities return to pre-pandemic levels.The non-COVID base business is expected to have gained from the company’s efforts to expand value-based contracts with payers. Over the past few months, the company has accelerated growth through health plan access. Excluding COVID-19, health plan volumes and revenues are seen growing faster than the overall base business. We expect value-based contracts (over the last two years DGX has renewed 12 national and large regional health plan contracts) to align better with health plans, allowing it to gain share in Q3.In this regard, earlier in 2022, Quest Diagnostics was selected as one of UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network providers for the fourth consecutive year. Other notable partnerships include the joint venture (JV) with Sonora Quest, where the JV resulted in approximately 3.7 million molecular tests (as per the company’s July update). These contracts might have contributed to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Apart from this, the company is expanding its diagnostic information services portfolio. In this regard, we may note Quest Diagnostics’ recent collaboration with IRIS (Intelligent Retinal Imaging Systems) to offer diabetic retinal imaging services through designated Quest Diagnostics patient service centers across the United States. The new service extends the Quest Diagnostics Extended Care portfolio of services, which aims to facilitate access to care beyond traditional healthcare settings.Story continuesQuest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseQuest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseQuest Diagnostics Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteHowever, the base business is likely to have faced continued inflationary headwinds as it did in the second quarter. To offset the inflationary pressure, Quest Diagnostics has been making several investments to strengthen advanced diagnostics capabilities within the base business.In the to-be-reported quarter, Quest Diagnostics’ COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to have declined year over year, owing to a robust year-ago comparison. Per its last-released media statement in October,the company noted that demand for its COVID-19 molecular testing in July was consistent with June. However, demand for COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing declined in August versus the prior month. This decline in COVID-19 diagnostic testing demand is likely to have significantly impacted sales in Q3. Also, the sales performance is anticipated to have been impacted by the reduced average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing.On a positive note, the FDA in September granted DGX the emergency use authorization for its monkeypox virus PCR test, the first EUA for a monkeypox in-vitro diagnostic during the monkeypox public health emergency. This might have provided a favorable boost to the company’s testing sales growth in Q3.Q3 EstimatesFor third-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.34 billion, indicating a 15.5% decline from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.14, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 45.9%.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates.

Based on 1,144,879 deidentified results of diagnostic tests by Quest Diagnostics between January 2018 and March 2022, the study is believed to be the largest to evaluate the association of the pandemic on cancer diagnoses, based on objective laboratory data, in the United States.The analysis found that cancer diagnoses plummeted by close to 30% in the first few months of the pandemic in 2020, when much of society and healthcare shut down. While cancer diagnoses increased over the subsequent two years, the gains have not been enough to offset diagnoses delayed or missed earlier in the pandemic.The findings suggest more people are living with undiagnosed cancers now than prior to the pandemic. A delayed cancer diagnosis can lead to more advanced disease, more aggressive and costly treatment, and worse outcomes.The study follows unaffiliated research by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) showing the death rate from cancer declined by 32% between 1991 and 2019, the year before the pandemic began, with gains ""attributed mainly to the unprecedented progress against lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer[i].""Story continues""The decline in the cancer death rate over the past three decades is a major healthcare achievement. And yet, our more recent analysis shows the pandemic, by delaying cancer diagnoses, is putting these gains at risk,"" said co-author Harvey W. Kaufman, MD, Senior Medical Director and Head of the Health Trends Research Program for Quest Diagnostics.The latest Quest Diagnostics analysis builds on two studies published by the company's medical team in JAMA Open Network in 2020 and 2021.Among the key findings:From March through May 2020, the monthly number of new diagnoses fell 30% for the 8 cancer types: breast, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, cervical, gastric, esophageal, and prostate. Declines were significant for all cancer types.From June 2020 through March 2021, the number of diagnoses declined 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels.From April 2021 to March 2022 (period 3), the number of diagnoses declined 11% compared to pre-pandemic levels.Diagnoses of prostate and breast cancer remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels as late as period 3, at 17% and 11% respectively.""While restrictions to travel and healthcare services lifted by summer 2020, our analysis reveals that the pandemic's adverse influence on utilization of preventative care and cancer screenings continues this year,"" said co-author Yuri Fesko, MD, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Quest Diagnostics. ""As an oncologist, I am particularly disturbed by the finding that cancer diagnoses for breast and prostate cancer are well below pre-pandemic levels. We hope this study encourages people to resume regular preventive care and to move without delay to visit their physician if they suspect a health problem. Doing so may literally save your life.""The Quest Diagnostics analysis has implications for hospitals and health systems, which are experiencing an increase in mastectomies (for breast cancer) and longer hospital stays for patients with prostate cancer along with other conditions that could have been caught in routine screenings.[ii]""Hospitals and health systems are struggling to keep up with sicker patients requiring greater care, a trend that our analysis suggests may worsen, at least for some cancers,"" said Dr. Fesko.The study's strengths include large size, national representation and use of objective laboratory data, while limitations include lack of racial and ethnic data.More than 600,000 people are expected to die of cancer 2022. Breast and prostate cancer are expected to account for nearly 30% of new cancer diagnoses in 2022.[iii]About Quest Diagnostics Health Trends®Quest Diagnostics Health Trends® is a series of scientific reports that provide insights into health issues, based on patient laboratory data, to empower better patient care, population health management and public health policy.

QuoteStrategic Alliances Boost ProspectsCisco’s shares have been negatively impacted by global supply chain challenges. The supply chain constraints resulted in a severe shortage of certain components that hurt Cisco’s ability to ship products to customers, thus hindering the top-line growth in the last reported quarter.Cisco’s top line growth was also impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war, which has put various business enterprises in the crosshairs of geopolitical tension.
