Ideally, you make consistent investments throughout your career to set yourself up to be as financially stress-free as possible in retirement.', ""With that thought process in mind, I like to add investments to my retirement account that I can passively invest in without worrying too much, which generally leads me to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Going the ETF route allows you to check many boxes at once, which is why I'm adding the following two to my retirement account in February."", ""If there is one stock I'll consistently add to my retirement account, regardless of the month, it's the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) because it's as close to a one-stop shop for stocks as you'll find."", 'The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF mirrors the S&P 500, which tracks the 500 largest stocks trading on the U.S. market. It has become the primary benchmark for the U.S. stock market and how most companies and funds measure their performance in a given year.', 'I like to view an investment in an S&P 500 ETF as an investment in the broader U.S. economy because of how much ground it covers and the importance of the companies it includes. The S&P 500 includes companies from all 11 major sectors, but maybe more importantly, it includes virtually all market leaders from these sectors. Below are the included sectors and a notable example from each:', 'Communication services: AT&T', 'Consumer discretionary: Amazon', 'Consumer staples: Procter & Gamble', 'Energy: ExxonMobil', 'Financials: Bank of America', 'Health Care: Johnson & Johnson', 'Industrials: Honeywell', 'Information technology: Apple', 'Materials: Ecolab', 'Real estate: Simon Property Group', 'Utilities: Duke Energy', ""The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is also one of the cheapest ETFs on the stock market, with a 0.03% expense ratio ($3 per $10,000 invested). I always stress that even though differences in expense ratios may seem small on paper, they can cost investors thousands of dollars over time. This is especially true when you're investing for retirement and potentially have decades' worth of fees."", ""For perspective, if you were to invest $1,000 monthly and average 10% annual returns over 25 years, you'd have around $1.17 million with a 0.03% expense ratio. If the expense ratio were 0.75% (like Cathie Wood's popular ARK Innovation ETF, for example), the investment value would drop to around $1.05 million. In this case, a slight 0.72% difference in fees would cost investors roughly $120,000 over that span. Fees matter."", ""You also can't go wrong with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF's historical results. There's no way to predict if it will continue at this rate, but it's a good indication of what's possible."", ""The second ETF I'm adding to my retirement account is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) because of its dividend focus. A lot of attention gets paid to stock price growth (or lack thereof), but dividends can often account for a lot of investors' total returns. In the past five years, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF stock price is up just over 50%. When you include its dividends, its total returns jump to over 78%."", ""The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF contains many large-cap stocks you'll find in the S&P 500, except the focus is on companies that pay above-average and sustainable dividends. It has a dividend yield of around 3.4%, around 2.5 times more than the S&P 500's current yield. Stock price growth is great, but when investing for retirement, it's nice to know you have consistent income coming in, regardless of stock price performance."", ""Using a dividend reinvestment program (DRIP) -- which takes the dividends you're paid and reinvests them into the stock that paid them out -- can drastically add to the effects of compound earnings. It's a way to maximize your total shares until retirement, when you'd ideally begin accepting your dividends in cash payouts."", ""I think it's always a good choice to have dividend-focused stocks in a well-rounded retirement portfolio because they can provide an additional income stream in retirement when many people need it most. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF can be a good low-cost (0.06% expense ratio) go-to investment."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for U.S. Bancorp the TSR over the last 3 years was -8.3%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!', ""Investors in U.S. Bancorp had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.7% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 28%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period.

Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Investors got an example of this when the retailer posted its Q4 earnings results in late February. That report showed some encouraging signs around growth combined with robust profit gains. Walmart also announced an unusually large dividend increase for 2024.', ""The report didn't dramatically shift the investing narrative around this established market leader. But there are some important things for investors to know about Walmart and its brand-new dividend payment."", ""Many national retailers, including Home Depot and Target, offer solid dividends and have boosted these payouts despite weakening sales trends.

Customer traffic at the world's leading retailer rose 4%, too.

""Our team delivered a great quarter,"" CEO Doug McMillon told investors on Feb. 20.', ""Walmart raised its dividend by 9% this year to mark a big improvement over last year's 2% increase. That's another way in which the retailer is standing out from its peers, who have had to scale back on the pace of their hikes."", 'Walmart can easily afford the much higher payout. Adjusted operating profit grew at a 10% rate this past fiscal year compared to declines of about the same magnitude at Home Depot.', 'Cash flow trends are even more instructive, since ultimately the dividend will track that metric over time. Walmart is sitting on $10 billion of cash today and it generated $15 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2024, up from $12 billion a year ago. The dividend is well covered by that production given the annual payout is less than $7 billion.', ""Investors have some good reasons to like Walmart's opportunities for growth and earnings in 2024 (the chain's fiscal 2025). It entered the year with excellent sales momentum and a light inventory position. These factors have management projecting sales will rise by between 3% and 4% this year as profits expand at a faster pace yet again."", ""Investors can find more impressive growth rates by looking outside of the retailing industry, of course. And Walmart's 4% profit margin sits below peers including Amazon and Target."", ""Yet this mature business still has the power to surprise Wall Street -- and not simply by announcing its latest stock split.

As long as their fundamentals don't change, these stocks can generate an increasing amount of dividend income for your portfolio over the years. And during that time, their valuations may also rise and boost your overall gains from holding these stocks."", ""Three top dividend growth stocks that recently raised their payouts are Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), and Walmart (NYSE: WMT). Here's how large their recent increases were, and why they can be excellent stocks to buy right now."", ""On Feb. 15, soft drink company Coca-Cola announced it would be increasing its dividend by 5.4%. The new quarterly dividend of $0.485 means investors who buy the stock now can collect a yield of around 3.2% -- that's the highest on this list. At that rate, you would need to invest approximately $31,250 into the stock to earn $1,000 in annual dividends."", ""Coca-Cola's dividend is a great reason for investing in the stock for the long term. The stock is a Dividend King and this recent rate hike is the 62nd consecutive year in which the company has raised its payouts. Given the company's strong position in the market, it's highly probable that Coca-Cola will continue hiking its dividend for years to come. "", ""The company is coming off a strong year in 2023 where net revenue increased by 6% to $45.8 billion and operating income jumped by 4% as Coca-Cola was able to pass rising costs on to consumers. While that strategy won't always work, it's a great indicator of the company's strong brands and overall resiliency, which highlights another reason this can be a fantastic stock to hold for the long haul."", ""Another resilient brand investors shouldn't hesitate to load up on is Home Depot. It's a brand that has become synonymous with home repair. And while demand for home repair isn't strong right now as consumers prioritize spending amid inflation, it's bound to bounce back in the long run."", ""And Home Depot doesn't appear to be concerned. While net sales of $34.8 billion for the period ending Jan. 28 were down 2.9%, the company still announced a generous 7.7% increase to its dividend. Although the company doesn't have a dividend growth streak as impressive as Coca-Cola's, Home Depot has been paying dividends for nearly 150 consecutive quarters and has been raising its payout since 2010. "", 'For the current fiscal year (which ends in January), the company expects sales to grow by a fairly modest rate of 1%. It may take some time for demand to recover but buying the retail stock for its growing dividend, which currently yields 2.4%, could give investors plenty of incentive to be patient.', 'The largest dividend increase on this list belongs to big-box retailer Walmart. Like Coca-Cola, this is another Dividend King with a remarkable track record for increasing its payouts. ', 'On Feb. 20, Walmart announced it was going to raise its dividend for a 51st consecutive year. But what stood out was the rate of the increase. At 9.2%, it was the biggest hike the company had made in more than a decade. ', ""Normally, companies with long dividend growth streaks make more modest increases, which can be more sustainable. Walmart's big increase shows that management has a lot of confidence in its ability to grow earnings in the future."", ""For the three-months ending Jan. 31, the company reported consolidated revenue of $173.4 billion, which was up 5.7% year over year. Its global e-commerce revenue rose at an even higher rate of 23%. The company's operating income of $7.3 billion was up an impressive 30.4% year over year as Walmart's operating expenses rose at a slower rate (3.8%) than revenue."", ""The company also recently announced plans to acquire smart TV maker Vizio, which could further bolster Walmart's growth opportunities. For long-term investors, Walmart can make for an excellent stock to buy and hold. With the increase, the stock now yields 1.4%, which is in line with the S&P 500 average."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

Roku\'s results were almost exactly in line with the average analyst\'s expectation, showing 13.5% year-over-year revenue growth while erasing two-thirds of its bottom-line losses.', ""Roku's stock plunged on the news. It closed 24% lower the next day, and the bearish action has added up to 33% since the report."", 'Is Roku suitable as an investment today? Was that report a harbinger of terrible business trends to come, or was it an invitation to pick up Roku stock on the cheap?', ""(Spoiler alert: I doubled down on my Roku investment last week. Here's why.)"", ""Fellow Fool David Jagielski recently explained why Roku's big price drop made sense to him, boiling it down to four main issues:"", ""The company faces many powerful rivals, led by the Amazon Fire line of smart-TV solutions. Retail titan Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is joining the fray by picking up smart-TV specialist Vizio (NYSE: VZIO) in a $2 billion buyout. The lineup of deep-pocketed industry giants is overwhelming for Roku's smaller-scale business."", ""Roku's profit margins may have improved in recent quarters but are still quite slim. In particular, the devices segment weighs on the company's bottom line with a steady stream of negative gross margins -- so it's bound to lose money every time a Roku-branded streaming stick, set-top box, or smart TV makes it from store shelves to living rooms. That's not a sustainable business plan."", ""David feels that the Vizio deal highlights how expensive Roku's stock is. Roku's annual revenue stream may be twice as large, but that doesn't mean it deserves more than four times Vizio's market cap. After all, Vizio currently generates a small profit while Roku is losing money."", ""Finally, David isn't impressed by the Roku experience. Alternative vendors like Samsung and Amazon offer comparable user experiences, and he may even prefer a Samsung TV's built-in software over adding a Roku stick. So where's Roku's business moat?"", ""As you might imagine, I don't agree with David's bearish Roku analysis. In fact, I see a couple of these purported problems as actual business advantages."", ""Heavy competition is nothing new for Roku. The company has faced behemoths like Amazon, Samsung, and Apple since the very beginning -- and still racks up a 55% market share in recent media-streaming system sales, according to Pixalate. Giving Vizio a Walmart-backed budget may shift the balance a little bit, but the deal doesn't look like a game changer."", ""Roku has chosen to run its business with slim profit margins since the inflation-based downturn started in 2021. Rivals protected their margins and contributed to the inflation problem by raising their prices, while Roku largely held its pricing flat, instead. As expected, gentler price tags drove strong unit sales throughout the economic crisis. You can call the devices segment's weak margin a marketing expense, as it helped Roku lift its active user count from 60 million to 80 million in two unprofitable years."", ""The company actually reported $176 million of free cash flow (FCF) in the most recent quarter, despite $104 million in negative earnings. Vizio's FCF stopped at $12 million in its latest earnings report. Again, Roku can control its profit margins by adjusting device prices. It's simply too early to sacrifice high growth at the altar of richer bottom-line profits."", ""On that note, I'm not convinced that Vizio's stock is any cheaper than Roku's. Sure, Vizio's stock trades for 1.3 times sales, while Roku's is worth 2.6 times sales, but that's comparing potatoes to oranges. Roku's sales are up 89% over the last three years, while Vizio's dropped 16% lower. If anything, I'm scratching my head over Walmart's willingness to pay $2 billion for that struggling business. Roku has earned its market cap the hard way."", ""I can't debunk David's personal experience with Roku's platform and comparable options. Beauty is in the eye of the TV viewer. However, Roku's 55% share of smart media device sales speaks volumes about the platform's combination of a polished user experience, reasonable price, and unbeatable support for different streaming services. Sector rivals may leave streaming platforms from direct competitors unsupported by their future media services, but it doesn't make sense to skip the world's most popular streaming software provider."", ""Feel free to do your own research and see where you land on the bull-to-bear scale. Some will side with David's analysis, leaving more bargain-priced Roku shares on the table for the rest of us. Only time will tell who's really right."", ""Still, I'm happy to bet real money on Roku's long-term future. The markets for smart TV sales and digital advertising will surely rebound as the era of skyrocketing inflation fades into a distant memory. It's a big world out there, and Roku's growth story is just getting started -- and this tasty growth stock looks incredibly cheap."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This teen clothing retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +246.9%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $1.42 billion, up 18.6% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.09% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Abercrombie would post earnings of $1.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.83, delivering a surprise of +60.53%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

The data come from the 24th edition of the Global Fleet and MRO Market Forecast 2024-2034."", '""Having clawed its way back from COVID, the industry is finally out of recovery mode and on a growth trajectory,"" said Anthony DiNota, Vice President of Oliver Wyman\'s CAVOK. ""But the pandemic is having a lasting impact. Before COVID the fleet was slated to reach 39,000 aircraft by 2030. However, this won\'t happen until 2036, with COVID wiping out six years of growth.""', 'Meanwhile, the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) sector will grow almost 3% in 2024, reaching $104 billion, and expand 1.8% annually on average through 2034.', 'Key findings of the forecast include:', ""Growth rate –\xa0The industry has now matched its pre-COVID peak, but growth moving forward will be slower. The fleet will expand 2.5% annually (compound annual growth rate) versus the 2.9% projected in last year's 2023-2033 forecast. Narrowbodies are expected to see a steady increase in their share of the fleet, rising from 61% in 2024 to 63% in 2034. This growth is driven by the resurgence of domestic air travel worldwide, which is projected to surpass the pre-COVID peak."", ""India leads in growth –\xa0For the first time ever,\xa0India will overtake China as the industry's growth leader, with the Indian fleet expected to expand almost 13% over the first five years of the forecast period and nearly 10% for the entire 10 years.

It is expected to expand to $124 billion by 2034. A raft of next-generation engines has entered the market over the past year, all of which have experienced their fair share of operational issues. For this reason, engine MRO will grow faster than other segments of the aftermarket, at a compound annual growth rate of 2.3%."", 'Pilot shortage –\xa0The industry is seeing relief from the pilot shortage as salaries for all pilots rise and more candidates seek their airline transport pilot certification. In North America, where the shortage has been the most acute, the gap between supply and demand will peak in 2026 at 24,000. The\xa0shortage will continue to put pressure on airlines – particularly regional airlines and ultra low-cost carriers in the United States – for the next 10 years.\xa0', ""Climate change\xa0– There remains uncertainty over how climate change will affect the industry's ability to grow. Already, some countries in the European Union have eliminated short-haul flights, and EU Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates will go into effect in 2025 when 2% of all fuel at European airports will have to be SAF. With the capability to cut emissions 50% and 80%, SAF can have a significant impact. While the technology exists and some airlines are already utilizing SAF, the current supply is insufficient to support the necessary growth in consumption required to achieve substantial reductions in aviation emissions."", '""The aviation industry is grappling with a multitude of challenges, including a fragile manufacturing supply chain, labor shortages, and higher capital costs. These obstacles are further complicated by geopolitical tensions and the pressing issue of climate change. The industry needs to position itself for sustainable growth while addressing the challenges it currently faces,"" said Brian Prentice, Partner, Oliver Wyman, and co-author of the report.', 'About the Global Fleet and MRO Market Forecast 2024-2034', ""The 2024-2034 edition of Oliver Wyman's Global Fleet and MRO Market Forecast represents its more than two-decade commitment to the understanding and assessment of the commercial airline transport fleet and the associated MRO market outlook.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', 'Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

I want to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call. It's such a great time to be in the cruise industry with wonderful new products available across all 3 of our award-winning brands. The demand for cruise vacations is certainly as robust as we have ever seen it. And the continued innovation on board is leading to outstanding financial performance and exceptional guest satisfaction scores and guest repeat rates. Today, it's my pleasure to discuss some of our key milestones in 2023, our progress on our near-term priorities, recent booking trends and our outlook for 2024. Later in the call, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our 2023 performance and guidance for 2024."", 'Now 2023 can best be described as a landmark year for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. We started the year on the heels of the last of the impact from COVID and the last of the cruise ports reopening in the Asia Pacific region throughout Q1. But as you can see on Slide 5, consumer demand was quick to rebound in full and we were pleased to return to full ships and full year profitability. It is so incredibly rewarding for our staff and crew to be able to operate full ships and deliver vacation experiences of a lifetime to our happy guests. While that in and of itself would have made for a spectacular 2023, we were further going by the introduction of 3 new world-class ships into our fleet, one for each of our 3 award-winning brands. This was an unprecedented achievement and a first in the 57-year history of our company.', 'We welcomed Oceania Cruises Vista in May, Norwegian Viva in August, and most recently, the highly anticipated Regent Seven Seas Grandeur in November. The successful launch of 3 vessels in 1 year would not have been possible without the hard work and unwavering commitment of crew and team members across the globe. Thanks to their dedication and passion for providing an unmatched guest experience, the reception for these new ships continues to be overwhelmingly positive across the board. This reception, combined with the strong demand environment, we continue to experience across all 3 of our brands, has enabled us to successfully absorb an 18% increase in capacity in 2023 versus 2019 levels at record pricing levels. As a result, we have driven revenue per passenger cruise day up 17%, allowing us to finish the year with year-end advanced ticket sales of $3.2 billion up an incredible 56% compared to 2019.', 'At the same time, we continue to maximize onboard revenue generation, as shown by growth onboard revenue per passenger cruise day, which is up 27% over 2019. A main driver of this large improvement is through enhanced presold onboard revenue, so our guests come on board with a fresh wallet. But none of this is new news. As we have been and continue to be the industry leader in net yields. We are proud of the work our teams do day in and day out to drive the highest yields in the industry. But today, I also want to emphasize that we are equally passionate about the cost side of the business. Our relentless focus on cost optimization has produced 4 sequential quarters of year-over-year adjusted new -- of year-over-year adjusted net cruise cost per capacity day reduction with full year 2023 coming in 21% lower than the prior year.', 'We achieved this by focusing our efforts on optimizing spend and investments across all areas of the business, from fuel to food and consumables and marketing. We are committed to continuing to optimize our margins by balancing products, revenue and cost considerations through better leveraging data and analytics to drive decision-making and accountability. The net result of these healthy revenue and cost metrics allowed us to get back to driving results. As we generated $1.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2023, allowing us to generate the adjusted free cash flow to further strengthen our balance sheet with the repayment of nearly $2 billion in debt. On the product front, we are strategically enhancing the guest experience by identifying smart ROI-driven investments and decisions to profitably maximize guest satisfaction.', ""Our recent success has been the rollout of Starlink high-speed Internet. We moved quickly and have been able to roll out this cutting-edge technology across half of our fleet since the spring of 2023 and expect to finish the full fleet by year-end this year. In addition, to significantly elevating the guest experience aboard our ships, we've been focusing on improving the pre-cruise guest experience and better leveraging digital tools across all 3 of our brands. For example, we've been making improvements to our pre-cruise planning functionality at Norwegian to allow guests to book even more before they leave their homes, and we rolled out a flexible air program at Oceania, sharing an innovation which began at Norwegian earlier in the year."", 'This innovation gives guests the few day window to deviate their air at the beginning and end of their cruise so they can have more time to explore and enjoy destinations before and after they sail with us, while at the same time, allowing us to spread air demand over multiple days and save costs, a true win-win for us and our guests. On the digital side, we recently launched the Regent onboard mobile app on Seven Seas Grandeur, and we continue to see strong adoption of the NCL mobile app, which reached record high guest usage in January. These improvements are not only resonating with our guests, giving them a better and more frictionless experience before, during and after their cruise, but are also generating positive returns. Finally, we announced important interim sustainability commitments, announcing our target to reduce greenhouse gas intensity on a capacity a day basis by 10% by 2026 and by 25% by 2030 versus 2019 levels.', 'The company is truly firing on all cylinders. These solid operational and financial results have laid the foundation for a strong 2024 and position us to deliver sustained profitable growth in the future and incredible vacation experiences to the millions of guests who sail with us every year. In addition to these priorities, a key cornerstone of our long-term strategy is delivering measured capacity growth and optimizing our fleet to drive strong financial results. Our new build pipeline of 5 ships, which you can see on Slide 7, represents a capacity growth of 28% from 2023 to 2028 with a 5% CAGR over the period. Historically, capacity growth has led to outsized revenue and EBITDA growth and we expect this capacity growth to be no different and deliver meaningful top and bottom line growth.', 'We believe that these measured capacity additions will enable us to further enhance our long-term profitability and continue to significantly strengthen our balance sheet while providing guests new and innovative experiences. Shifting our discussion to the current booking environment shown on Slide 8. We continue to experience strong and resilient customer demand across all 3 of our brands. The strong momentum we saw in 2023 has continued into 2024 with an all-time high book position and pricing buoyed by strong wave season demand. This has led to some of the best booking weeks in the company history, which began with successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions. In general, we continue to see healthy demand across all markets, brands and products.', ""Let me walk you through some recent trends. First, close-in demand for Caribbean sailing is particularly strong prompting the redeployment of Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway from offering shoulder season full 2024 voyages in the med to offering Caribbean sailings from Port Canaveral and New Orleans, respectively, beginning in October. As a result, our Caribbean capacity for the NCL brand is expected to increase by approximately 300 basis points in 2024 versus the prior year. Our industry's advantage lies in our ability to redeploy our ships and adapt to changes in consumer demand and preferences. These changes demonstrate our team's responsiveness to our guests' preferences. We have also seen demand return for sailings in Hawaii. While only accounting for approximately 4% of capacity in this period, these sailings are performing exceptionally well in 2024."", ""Next, our Norwegian Cruise Line brand continues to see exceptionally strong demand and our book position and pricing are higher than last year for all 4 quarters of 2024. Oceania, Regent also continued to see strong demand across all geographies with the exception of redeployed voyages due to cancellations in the Middle East and Red Sea. Turning to the Middle East. Last quarter, we made the preemptive decision to cancel all calls to Israel in 2024. And recently, we have announced the rerouting of our cruises sailing through the Red Sea for the rest of the year. As a reminder, just 1% and 4% of our capacity in Q1 and full year '24, respectively, was expected to dip in the broader Middle East region. However, the Middle East represents a larger percentage of our capacity for our Oceania and Regent brands making up 12% and 8%, respectively."", 'We now have no calls in the region in 2024 and all replacement cruises have been or are in the process of being put on sale. Overall, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for 2024, which remains at all-time highs with commensurate higher pricing. As a result, 2024 is shaping up to be a solid year. We expect healthy full year net yield growth of approximately 5.4% this year on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by improved occupancy and pricing strength. Onboard revenue continues to be a bright spot with strength seen across the board, an encouraging indicator that our target consumer remains healthy and resilient. We are continuing to see strong demand for pre-cruise purchases which typically results in higher overall spend throughout a guest cruise journey.', 'And while we have talked about our strong cost focus during 2023, we want to emphasize that this was not just a 1-year exercise for our team. Rather, it is a cultural shift in the way our entire company looks at cost to ensure that we are operating as efficiently as possible while delivering experiences our guests truly value. This company-wide focus should allow us to not only continue to reduce costs but even more importantly, create operating leverage to enhance profitability, which will be foundational for our long-term success. Our recently established transformation office is allowing us to monitor and track these changes holding each area accountable for their initiatives. We believe this is apparent in our guidance where we expect our core cost to be flat in 2024 versus 2023.', ""In conclusion, our strong top line growth, combined with our continued focus on cost and margin enhancements are expected to drive 2024 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to grow by 18% and 76%, respectively, over last year. We are very excited about the future, and we plan to discuss our multiyear targets with the investment community in mid-May. We look forward to meeting with you all then. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mark?"", ""Mark Kempa: Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth quarter 2023 financial results, 2024 guidance, and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2023 and 2024 net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2019 and 2023, respectively. Let's begin with our fourth quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 11. Starting with the top line, results were strong with net per diems increasing approximately 14.5% and net yield increasing approximately 8.6%. As discussed last quarter, Several factors contributed to the exceptionally strong growth we saw, including the favorable comp from the rapid exit of Cuba in 2019 as well as a very strong close-in demand for Caribbean sailings."", 'Looking at costs. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day was in line with guidance at $151 in the quarter marking our fourth consecutive quarter of improvement on this important metric. As expected, this included approximately $1 of certain nonrecurring net benefits realized in the quarter. We have made significant progress streamlining our cost base during 2023, demonstrating our focus and commitment to our margin enhancement initiatives, and expect to continue this focus in 2024 and beyond. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $360 million, in line with guidance, while adjusted EPS was a loss of negative $0.18 slightly below guidance due to a $0.06 impact from FX below the line. Overall, we were very pleased with the results we generated in the fourth quarter and full year.', ""Strong top line growth combined with continued progress on reducing costs, enabled us to generate full year adjusted EBITDA just short of $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.70. All of which drove strong adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion. I am confident that our improved financial performance in 2023 has set the foundation for a solid 2024 and beyond. Moving on to expectations for '24. Our outlook for the first quarter and full year can be found on Slide 12. Starting with the full year, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, an 18% improvement versus 2023 with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to improve by almost 250 basis points. Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $635 million with adjusted EPS expected at approximately $1.23, a 76% increase versus 2023."", 'Before I get into our top line expectations, there are a couple of important points to keep in mind for your models. First, given our strong expected net income growth for the year, shares related to our exchangeable notes are expected to be dilutive and are included in our share count for 2024. As a reminder, we must settle the exchangeable notes due in 2024 and 2025 in shares while both of our exchangeable notes due 2027 can be settled in cash or shares at our sole election. However, the accounting treatment requires we consider all notes as if they were settled in shares. As a result, we assume our full year 2024 average share count to be approximately 516 million. Secondly, we successfully migrated our tax residency from the U.K. to Bermuda as of December 31, 2023, and we do not expect recently enacted Bermuda corporate income tax legislation to have a significant impact on our overall tax rate as this was already assumed in our planning.', 'Taking a closer look at the components of the outlook, occupancy is expected to be approximately 105%. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 5.5% inclusive of the headwinds from the outsized impact of the Middle East and Red Sea on our Oceania and Regent brands primarily in the second and fourth quarter. For modeling purposes, our year yield growth will be highest in the first quarter as we are lapping lower load factors and a non-optimized itinerary mix in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we are seeing strong demand for Caribbean sailings in the first quarter of 2024, which represents approximately 58% of our total deployment in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, yield growth is expected to return to more normalized levels despite the pressure from the aforementioned Middle East and Red Sea headwinds.', 'Moving to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $159 for the full year. This represents a 3.4% increase versus full year 2023, but -- which includes the incremental impact of more dry dock days in 2024. Excluding that impact, our core costs are essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. To put this in perspective, this effectively represents approximately $100 million of cost savings given our expected core inflation rate of around 3% for next year. For modeling purposes, keep in mind that 2023 had less dry docks than normal as we took the opportunity to dry docks ships while they were out of service, this year we are returning to a more normalized dry dock schedule and expect roughly a 175 dry dock days in the year.', 'This will impact adjusted cruise cost ex fuel by approximately 325 basis points on a year-over-year basis or approximately $5 on a unit cost basis. This includes both the impact of dry dock costs and the related reduction of capacity days. Excluding the impact of that, we expect full year adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel would be approximately $154 essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. Note that the timing of this impact is expected to be weighted more to the first half of the year, with approximately 2/3 of our dry dock days occurring in that period. This year we will continue to be relentless in our efforts to enhance margins and reduce costs. We are leaving no stone unturned and are continually identifying opportunities big and small across the business.', 'Our transformation office is running full speed ahead in identifying operating inefficiencies and operating -- and opportunities for improvement across all areas of our operating platform in order to enhance the acceleration of our margin recovery and related cash generation. One key focus area for us has been optimizing both our fuel consumption and bunkering strategies. Fuel costs are one of our largest expense line items, and our teams have been hard at work at fostering partnerships with the likes of DNV on decarbonization and long term agreements with industry leader ABB to drive new opportunities to lower our fuel consumption per capacity day. In addition to the consumption side of the equation we have made a big leap in the optimization of our fuel bunkering strategy that allows us to maximize price leverage across the various ports and suppliers we use during a season and in many cases even during a single voyage.', ""We believe this will drive double-digit millions in savings in the first year alone. This is just one of the many examples that support our relentless drive to improve our unit costs and leverage our scale all without impacting the guest experience. I look forward to sharing many more tangible examples at our upcoming Investor Day in May. The combination of our more efficient cost structure and strong expected top line growth for the year is expected to drive the expansion of our full year adjusted EBITDA margins up by approximately 250 basis points. Now let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. As I said earlier, net yield is strong in the first quarter and is expected to increase approximately 15.5%. Adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day is expected to be $165 or approximately 3% versus the same quarter last year."", 'As mentioned, we expect an increase in dry dock days in the quarter, which will have a $6 or a 350 basis point impact on adjusted net cruise cost in Q1. Excluding that impact, adjusted net cruise costs would be $159, essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the impact of inflation with our cost savings. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $450 million. Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $50 million and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.12. Given the quarter is essentially complete, we do not expect significant outperformance in the top line versus expectations as the vast majority of our inventory is already sold. Any limited upside would result from our onboard revenue generating performance during the month of March.', 'Moving on to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile on Slide 14. In 2023, we generated almost $2 billion of net cash from operating activities, which included $500 million return of cash collateral. And we repaid $1.9 billion of debt, including the full paydown of our $875 million revolving loan facility. Most recently, we successfully negotiated a refinancing of our $650 million backstop commitment from a secured to an unsecured basis. And in connection with this refinancing $250 million 9.75 secured notes due in 2028, our highest interest rate debt is expected to be repaid. This refinancing, which is expected to close in early March will reduce interest expense, improve leverage while also releasing all of the related collateral, another important step forward in improving our balance sheet.', ""Moving to leverage on Slide 15. The company has a solid track record of delevering the balance sheet. From 2014 to 2019, we successfully delevered by over 3 turns. We will continue to be opportunistic and look for further ways to strengthen our balance sheet. We are confident we can make meaningful progress on this front going forward. At year-end '23, with reported net leverage of approximately 7.3x or approximately 6.75x when excluding the impact of ships delivered in the second half of the year. We continue to expect significant improvement in this metric over time, driven by our organic cash generation and scheduled debt amortization payments. Over the course of 2024, we expect to reduce our reported leverage by almost 1.5 turns with sequential improvements in each quarter."", ""This improvement does not assume any prepayment of debt, apart from the aforementioned takeout of our $250 million notes expected in early March. Going forward, we are refining a multiyear plan to further accelerate the reduction of leverage and derisk our balance sheet in order to drive shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks."", ""Harry Sommer: Well, thank you, Mark. Truly encouraging results. Moving forward, our entire team will be focused on the most important work. First, we will continue to execute on our near-term priorities and capitalize on the strong demand from cruising from our target upscale demographic. Second, we will build upon the progress we've already made with our ongoing margin enhancement efforts with further improvements in costs. And finally, we will continue to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage over time. In closing, I couldn't be more excited about the year ahead. I am confident that we have the right resources in place to capitalize on the strong demand environment and deliver exceptional vacation experiences for our guests across all 3 of our brands, execute on our operational and financial goals for 2024 and ultimately deliver long-term profitable growth and shareholder value."", ""I look forward to share you the results of our strategic assessment of our business and defining our vision for the future of the company, including long-term financial targets at our Investor Day this coming May. With that, I'm happy to turn it over to the operator for questions."", 'See also 44 Countries With Hot and Wet Equatorial Climate and 15 Countries With Most Cyber Crime In The World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

When it comes to identifying the best employee benefits companies, it's important to explore various sectors, including tech giants and manufacturing firms.

(The stock fell back into the red later on Wednesday, though its decline was still less severe than before Benioff's comments)."", 'Demand to implement AI among Salesforce customers is ""heavy,"" Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said on the earnings call, although Salesforce executives acknowledged that they were not banking on any boost from AI in the company\'s sales forecast for its current fiscal year.', ""Salesforce said that it expects revenue in the current year to range between $37.7 billion and $38 billion, an increase of 8% to 9% from the prior year. That continues a slowdown in Salesforce's topline growth, which increased by 11% in the recently ended fiscal 2024, 18% in fiscal 2023, and 25% in fiscal 2022."", 'On the other hand, Salesforce has bulked up its profit margins in recent years thanks in large part to significant cost cutting in headcount and real estate. Operating margins increased to 14.4% in fiscal 2024, up from 3.3% the year before, and Salesforce projected operating margins of 20.4% for the current year. The company also announced Wednesday that it would pay investors a quarterly cash dividend of 40 cent per share.', 'During the call, Benioff seemed to delight in calling out examples of companies—some of whom he said were longtime Salesforce customers—who had been stung by high-profile AI mishaps after using products from other companies. Without naming names, he cited a recent court case involving Air Canada, in which the airline was forced to honor a refund policy after its customer service chatbot provided a customer with inaccurate airfare information.', '""This company, which is a great company and a customer of ours but did not use our technology, went out there and used some kind of rogue AI that they picked off the internet,"" Benioff said during the call. ""Some engineer just hobbled it, hooked it up, and then it started just spewing these hallucinations and falsehoods around their loyalty program, and the courts are holding them liable. Good.""', 'It was one of several cautionary tales Benioff ticked off, including The New York Times\' legal battle with OpenAI. ""Let every CEO wake up and realize we are on the verge of one of the greatest transformation in the history of technology but trust must be our highest value,"" Benioff said.', '""In the enterprise, you need deep integration of data and metadata for the AI to understand and deliver the critical insights and intelligence that customers need across their business, across sales, service, marketing, commerce, whatever it is. That deep integration of the data and metadata. That\'s not too easy,"" Benioff said. ""That\'s not just some amalgamated, stolen, public data set. In the enterprise, that deep integration of data meant data and metadata. Oh, that\'s what Salesforce does.""', 'Benioff also name-checked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, likening the company\'s AI chips to the indispensable ""Levi\'s jeans"" for modern-day gold miners. However, Benioff said, the true treasure trove resides in data, which is where he said Salesforce shines brightest with its portfolio of products to help businesses leverage all their internal data and ready it for AI applications.', 'The message: let others play with the clothing and pick axes in the AI gold rush, Salesforce has the gold.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Through the later focused efforts of our global team, excluding payments and deposits related to the resolution of certain prior year’s tax matters, we delivered $467 million of free cash flow well above our guided estimate. Dustin will provide a more comprehensive overview of our financial performance shortly. Now, let us move on to our 2024 market and business update. While our end markets in 2024 should be better than 2023, we expect the best and L-shaped recovery with no near-term growth catalyst. We are continuing the transformational actions that we detailed during our third quarter call. We will continue to focus on our core business and customers, restore underlying fundamentals, and position ourselves for accelerated growth in 2025 and beyond.', 'I will now share some updates across our transformational initiatives. First, as we previously mentioned, we recognize the need to reallocate global resources back into our regions to enhance customer proximity and improve commercial effectiveness. As part of our reorganization efforts, we also determined that blending the protective and food commercial teams contributed to a loss of customer centricity and reduced commercial rigor. Consequently, we have reorganized our commercial teams by reestablishing food and protective operating units within each region and shifted global resources to our regional teams. This is an initial step in our broader transformation to improve our commercial execution and capture incremental market share as conditions improve.', 'Second, with sustainability as an accelerating mega trend in both food and protective, now more than ever, innovation will play a critical role in driving outside market growth. To maximize our opportunity, we are shifting our innovation focus from the laboratory to the field. What does this mean? We have a strong material science research and development capability, but we need to take the next step forward by better leveraging the voice of the customer to help prioritize and shape our innovation pipeline. Making this shift combined with our scale will allow us to outpace our competition, ultimately improving time to market and the commercial success of our new products. Throughout 2024, we will be introducing new recycle ready products at an accelerating rate, bringing to market full automation solutions within case ready, and expanding applications within our fluids and liquids businesses.', ""Moving to Slide 4. You can see a practical example of where sustainability pressures, driven by new regulations and consumer preferences, are driving unprecedented shifts in the protein trays market. In response, we recently introduced the first bio-based industrially compostable tray for protein packaging. These trays provide comparable performance and stability to traditionally expanded polystyrene trays, allowing us to gain share in an estimated $5 billion tray market while supporting our customer sustainability goals. Next, we have continued our portfolio optimization efforts, investing in core growth products while deprioritizing those that no longer align with our strategic objectives. We have made a lot of progress in redefining the long-term strategy for our portfolio of solutions, in large part getting back to SEE's differentiated material science, automation and service expertise."", 'As our transformation takes hold, end markets recover and financing environment improves, we will be in a much stronger position to take actions to drive further shareholder value. Meanwhile, our primary focus remains on making improvements we can drive regardless of the operating environment. Finally, our cost reduction initiatives within CTO2Grow are progressing as planned. In 2023, we drove actions culminating in an annual run rate savings largely in 2024 of $50 million, up from $40 million at the end of the third quarter. As part of the effort, we have completed three plant closures in 2023, and are in the process of closing four additional sites as part of our footprint rationalization efforts with more sites on the review. In addition, we are rightsizing our Argentina operation given recent regulatory and economic instability.', 'With the actions we have driven so far, we are currently at a total of $65 million in annual run rate savings. Building upon this momentum, we are confident in our ability to achieve $90 million in year-over-year cost savings in 2024. Moving on to updates on our Food and Protective segments. We observed ongoing challenges in the Food segment, where volumes declined year-over-year. However, sequential performance improved in Q4 due to increased holiday demand. The challenges we faced in the fourth quarter stemmed from multiple factors, including the rebuilding of the cattle herd in North America, shifts in the European protein production and consumption and consumer trade down in retail food. The depressed capital cycle, coupled with higher interest rates, negatively impacted our equipment business as customers scaled back their capital expenditures to preserve cash.', ""We expect these trends to continue into 2024. For Protective, 2023 was a turbulent year. Real industrial production contracted year-over-year in most advanced economies. High inflation and the subsequent drag on real income continued to squeeze household spending power and is reducing the demand for consumer goods. Additionally, sustainability and new business models like shipping your own container and buy online, pick up in store continue to reshape e-commerce packaging choices and demand. Pricing pressures have intensified as competitors step up to address weak market demand. On a positive note, the destocking of downstream inventories is largely complete. Different from previously expected, while market indicators are signaling an improving 2024, we have not yet seen this translate into improving demand for our customers' businesses and subsequent restocking or uptick in volumes for our packaging solutions."", ""While we do not see an immediate near-term market catalyst, we are anticipating a gradual recovery in our end markets throughout 2024 with volume lift towards the end of the year and continuing into 2025. As our markets recover, our focus on innovation and sustainability, coupled with our CTO2Grow and strategic commercial initiatives, gives us confidence in SEE's continued recovery. Now I'd like to turn it over to Dustin to review our financial results. Dustin?"", ""Dustin Semach: Thank you, Emile, and good morning, everyone. Moving to the fourth quarter and full year results. Let's turn to Slide 5. Net sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, flat on a constant currency basis, and were $5.5 billion for the full year of 2023, down 1% at constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $274 million, down 8% compared to last year. For the year, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.1 billion, down 9%. Volumes have improved sequentially in Q4 as holiday demand drove a low single-digit seasonality pickup. As reported, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.88 were down 11% compared to a year ago. Our adjusted tax rate was 18% compared to 26.1% in the same period last year, driven by a onetime benefit due to the reversal of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions."", 'We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $144.9 million. For the year, adjusted earnings per share of $3.18 was down 22%, primarily driven by lower adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower tax expense. Turning to Slide 6. In Q4, Liquibox contributed 5% to total company sales or approximately $70 million, but was offset by lower pricing in Protective and lower volume in both businesses. The volume declines were driven by continued market pressures in Protective, lower automation sales as well as continued weakness in food retail end markets. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $274 million, which included $50 million contribution from Liquibox, decreased $23 million or approximately 8% compared to last year with margins of 19.9% and down 120 basis points.', 'This performance was mainly driven by lower volumes within both segments, offset by contributions from Liquibox. Moving to Slide 7. In the fourth quarter, Food net sales of $893 million were down 3% on an organic basis, primarily due to the volume declines driven by lower automation sales as customers enforce tighter controls on capital expenditures and by continued weakness in retail demand. Food adjusted EBITDA of $195 million in the fourth quarter was down 3%, with margins at 21.8%, down 130 basis points compared to last year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was mainly driven by higher operating costs and lower volumes, partially offset by contributions from Liquibox and favorable net price realization of $10 million. Protective fourth quarter net sales of $485 million were down 10% organically, driven by lower pricing and volume declines in Americas and EMEA from continued market pressures in the industrial fulfillment markets.', 'Protective adjusted EBITDA of approximately $90 million was down 12% in the fourth quarter, with margins at 18.7%, down 50 basis points. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was driven by unfavorable net price realization and lower volumes, partially offset by favorable productivity benefits. On Slide 8, we review our fourth quarter net sales by segment and by region. In constant dollars, net sales were flat with 5% growth in Food, mainly driven by the Liquibox acquisition, while Protective was down 10% due to weak end market demand. By region, Asia Pac grew 5% organically driven by a strong Australian cattle cycle. Americas was down 6% due to lower automation sales, a weak U.S. cattle cycle and lower pricing in Protective. EMEA declined 11% on challenging market conditions across both segments and continued destocking within Protective.', ""In constant dollars, full year net sales were up 9% in food, while Protective was down 15%. By region, we were up 3% in Asia Pac, offset by declines of 2% in Americas, and 1% in EMEA. Now let's turn to free cash flow and leverage on Slide 9. Through the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the payments and deposits related to the resolution of certain prior year tax matters, free cash flow was $467 million compared to $376 million in the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 24% year-over-year. The primary driver of this improvement was significant inventory reduction, partially offset by lower earnings and higher interest costs. Since the peak in the second quarter of 2023, we have reduced total debt by approximately $280 million, exiting the year with a net leverage ratio of 3.9x, down from 4.1x in the third quarter."", ""Our total liquidity position was $1.3 billion, including $346 million in cash and the remaining amount in committed and fully undrawn revolver. We will continue to focus on driving net debt to adjusted EBITDA to below 3.5x over the next two years. Let's turn to Slide 10 to review our 2024 outlook. We expect L-shape recovery through 2024 and into 2025. As a result, we expect net sales to be in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion, which at the midpoint assumes a 2% decline in organic growth with flat volume growth offset by negative pricing. Portfolio exits represent 0.5% lower volume in both segments. While the global protein end markets continue to be challenged, our food volume is expected to grow approximately 1%, driven by competitive wins in our core businesses, momentum in our fluids and liquids businesses, including Liquibox, and our new product launches, offset by pricing declines of 2%."", 'Our work on integration and operational momentum at Liquibox is taking hold, and we expect the business to continue to improve across 2024, further supported by a positive outlook for the food service end markets. We see a slower market recovery in Protective than previously anticipated with a full year volume decline of approximately 1%. Pricing pressures have increased, further reducing top line by 3% as the competitive landscape has intensified in a lower volume environment. Protective volumes are expected to recover towards the end of 2024 as our new commercial model gains traction and market dynamics improve. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which assumes adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 20% at the midpoint.', 'This outlook is lower than our soft guide provided during our Q3 earnings call, mainly driven by lower volume expectations. We anticipate continued softness in the first half of 2024 as volume reaches the trough and gradually improves as the market conditions and seasonality improve in the second half. We remain disciplined to drive the necessary cost actions to offset further volume weakness. The midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance is in line with 2023, with $90 million year-over-year cost savings offsetting flattish overall volumes, negative net price realization and restoring bonus pools. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $3.05 per share. The lower 2024 adjusted EPS is largely driven by higher depreciation, interest and tax expense with an assumed tax rate of 26% to 27%.', 'We expect full year 2024 free cash flow in the range of $325 million to $425 million. At the midpoint, our free cash flow conversion as a percent of adjusted net earnings is expected to be 90%. We are assuming approximately $80 million in restructuring charges, and approximately $20 million incremental cash interest payments, offset by favorable working capital of roughly $30 million. Lastly, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect net sales and adjusted EBITDA to be ranged around $1.3 billion and $240 million, respectively, with earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.60. Our ranges and outlook reflect the dynamic environment we continue to operate in. As we gain more visibility throughout the year, we will be able to adjust and update expectations accordingly.', 'Turning to Slide 11. We closed out the year in line with our expectations and remain committed to executing against our caustic up to growth efforts. While our expectation for 2024 has reduced to a weaker and longer recovery period for our end markets, we are encouraged by the feedback from our customers and our distributors that destocking is largely behind us and are more confident in a second half modest recovery in volumes. We are focused on driving a transformation at SEE in 2024, improving commercial execution and restoring business fundamentals. We expect 2025 to be the year we return to a normal growth trajectory and where our cost reduction and operational excellence initiatives will position us well to return to adjusted EBITDA growth in 2025 and beyond.', ""Lastly, I'd like to close by thanking the global SEE team, who are at the center of our transformation for their efforts solving our customers' most critical packaging challenges day in and day out. With that, Emile and I look forward to your questions. Operator, we would like to begin the Q&A session."", 'See also 25 Companies with the Best Benefits and Perks and 20 Countries With the Longest Coastlines in the World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

PG&E is pre-staging crews and materials and is prepared to use helicopters, snow cats and four-wheel drive to gain access to hard hit areas; however, customers in remote areas should prepare for extended outages given the unique circumstances of this storm.', 'The utility also has been communicating with cities and counties to share preparation and plans.', 'Storm Safety Tips', 'Just as PG&E follows its plan to prepare for and respond to a storm, customers are urged to prepare their families and neighbors as well.

Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&E at 1-800-743-5002.', 'Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should ensure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on powerlines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.', 'Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, animals and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.', 'Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running.', 'Have fresh drinking water and ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer to prevent food spoilage.', 'Secure your outside furniture:\xa0Strong winds can blow lawn chairs and other outdoor items into powerlines.', 'Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns.', 'Safely clean up:\xa0After the storm has passed, be sure to safely clean up.

With a market capitalization of approximately $13.7 billion as of mid-2023, and a global workforce of 21,610 employees, the company has demonstrated resilience and innovation in its sector. The financial overview reveals a company that has effectively leveraged its flagship Invisalign product and iTero intraoral scanners to maintain a dominant market position, treating over 2 million cases in 2022 alone. Despite a slight decrease in the workforce, Align Technology Inc remains committed to its growth pillars, focusing on international expansion, GP dentist treatment, patient demand, and orthodontic utilization. The following SWOT analysis delves into the company's internal and external factors that influence its operational and strategic decisions."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with ALGN.', ""Brand Dominance and Market Share: Align Technology Inc's Invisalign system is a powerhouse in the orthodontic industry, commanding over 90% of the clear aligner market. The brand's strength is not just in its market share but also in its widespread acceptance by dental professionals, with over 230,000 Invisalign-trained dentists and orthodontists worldwide. This extensive network is a testament to the company's successful marketing and training initiatives, which have entrenched Invisalign as the go-to solution for malocclusion treatments. The brand's dominance is further bolstered by its ability to treat roughly 90% of all malocclusion cases, showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of its product line."", ""Technological Innovation and Integration: Align Technology Inc's commitment to technological advancement is evident in its iTero intraoral scanners, which are integral to the Invisalign treatment process. With over 85% of Invisalign cases submitted by digital scans, iTero's role in the company's ecosystem is crucial. The scanners not only streamline the treatment planning process but also enhance the patient experience with quick and accurate digital impressions. This integration of technology across the treatment workflow underscores Align's position as a leader in digital orthodontics, setting a high bar for competitors."", ""Workforce Reduction and Operational Challenges: Despite its strong market position, Align Technology Inc has experienced a reduction in its workforce by approximately 6.7% in 2023. This downsizing could indicate underlying operational challenges that may impact the company's ability to innovate and expand at its previously rapid pace. A smaller workforce may lead to increased pressure on existing employees, potential delays in product development, and challenges in maintaining the high level of customer service that has been a hallmark of Align's success."", ""Cybersecurity Risks: In an era where data breaches and cyber threats are increasingly common, Align Technology Inc acknowledges the importance of robust cybersecurity measures. The company has taken steps to assess the effectiveness of its security practices, but the risk of a breach remains a significant concern. A successful cyberattack could lead to substantial financial costs, damage to the company's reputation, and erosion of customer trust, which are critical for a company that relies heavily on digital technology for its products and services."", ""Global Expansion Potential: Align Technology Inc's strategic focus on international expansion presents significant opportunities for growth. With a presence in over 100 markets and strategic investments in manufacturing and treatment planning operations worldwide, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging markets with growing demand for orthodontic treatments. The potential to increase international revenues, particularly in regions with low market penetration, offers a promising avenue for Align to diversify its revenue streams and reduce reliance on the more saturated American market."", ""Digital Dentistry Advancements: The ongoing digital transformation in dentistry aligns with Align Technology Inc's core competencies in clear aligner and intraoral scanner technologies. As the industry continues to embrace digital solutions, Align's existing products and commitment to innovation place it at the forefront of this shift. The company's ability to offer an integrated suite of digital treatment solutions positions it to capture a larger share of the market as dental professionals seek out efficient, accurate, and patient-friendly technologies."", ""Macroeconomic Sensitivities: Align Technology Inc's performance is not immune to global economic conditions. Factors such as inflation, currency fluctuations, and general economic downturns can adversely affect consumer spending on elective medical treatments like orthodontics. The company's reliance on discretionary consumer spending makes it vulnerable to economic cycles, which could lead to reduced demand for its products and services during periods of economic uncertainty."", 'Competitive Pressures: The orthodontic and dental device markets are highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. While Align Technology Inc currently enjoys a dominant position, the emergence of new competitors or innovative technologies could erode its market share. The company must continuously innovate and improve its product offerings to stay ahead of the competition and maintain its leadership in the industry.', ""In conclusion, Align Technology Inc (NASDAQ:ALGN) stands as a leader in the orthodontic industry, backed by its strong brand, technological prowess, and strategic growth initiatives. However, it must navigate challenges such as workforce optimization, cybersecurity threats, and macroeconomic fluctuations. The company's opportunities for international expansion and digital dentistry innovation present pathways to further success, but it must remain vigilant against competitive pressures that threaten its market dominance. As Align Technology Inc continues to evolve, its ability to leverage its strengths and address its weaknesses while capitalizing on opportunities and mitigating"", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

After helming the technology company for a quarter of a century, the chief executive stepped down to spend more time on his charitable endeavors. Since then, Gates has grown his wealth and is now worth an estimated $127.7 billion, according to Forbes, making him the seventh-richest person in the world.', 'Gates\' charitable efforts are mostly focused on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. The mission of the trust is ""to create a world where every person has the opportunity to live a healthy, productive life."" The foundation has spent nearly $54 billion since 2000, ""taking on the toughest, most important problems."" As a result, the trust\'s holdings are in a constant state of flux. While it holds stakes in dozens of companies, four well-known stocks dominate the list.', ""It isn't a bit surprising that Microsoft would lead the pack, given Gates' inexorable ties to the company. Furthermore, he seeded the foundation by donating a chunk of his Microsoft shares. The Gates Foundation owns more than 38 million shares of Microsoft stock valued at $14.3 billion."", ""Yet this isn't your grandfather's Microsoft. Under the watchful eye of CEO Satya Nadella, the company has shifted its focus from on-premises software to the cloud — a strategy that's been wildly successful."", 'In the calendar fourth quarter of 2023, Microsoft Azure was the world\'s second-largest cloud infrastructure provider, controlling 26% of the market, according to technology analyst firm Canalys. Perhaps more importantly, it was the fastest-growing of the ""Big Three"" cloud providers, growing 30% year over year, beating out both Amazon Web Services and Alphabet\'s Google Cloud, which grew 13% and 26%, respectively. Moreover, cloud revenue now represents 54% of Microsoft\'s total revenue and is the fastest-growing of the company\'s major endeavors.', 'Perhaps Microsoft\'s biggest opportunity is artificial intelligence (AI). The company moved quickly to capitalize on the rise of generative AI, and its position as a cloud leader gives Microsoft the inside track to sell AI to its cloud customers. In fact, in the most recent quarter, Microsoft noted Azure\'s growth included ""six points of growth from AI services.""', ""Finally, Microsoft has been paying its dividend consistently since 2004, with 14 consecutive annual increases. The yield is a seemingly tepid 0.7%, but that is largely due to the strong stock price appreciation over the past two years. The stock has generated dividend gains of 265% over the past five years, despite the worst economic downturn in years. Furthermore, as Microsoft's profits have risen, its payout ratio has fallen to 25% — near its lowest level in a decade. That gives Microsoft plenty of resources to boost its dividend for the foreseeable future."", 'Warren Buffett has made no secret of his goal to eventually donate all his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) stock to charity. He joined Gates in 2006 and has since donated $36 billion through 2022 to the Gates Foundation — and has encouraged other wealthy individuals to become benefactors. As a result, the Gates Foundation owns nearly 20 million Berkshire shares valued at $7.1 billion.', ""While the shares were donated, there are plenty of reasons the foundation still holds much of the stock. Until the cash is needed for charitable causes, Berkshire Hathaway's vast collection of businesses and stock holdings provides instant diversification while also providing a steady stream of cash flow."", 'One example of the company\'s cash-gushing capability is its insurance businesses — which include National Indemnity, GEICO, General Re, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance, and Alleghany. These businesses ""performed exceptionally well last year, setting records in sales, float, and underwriting profits,"" according to Berkshire\'s recently released shareholder letter. In fact, these insurance businesses and the associated investment income accounted for 40% of Berkshire\'s operating income of $37.35 billion.', ""Given the company's long-term track record of success, significant cash flow generation, and large cash pile, it isn't surprising that it still represents a large portion of Gates' holdings."", 'Speaking of Warren Buffett, railroads are a subject near and dear to his heart. When Berkshire Hathaway snapped up ownership of Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2009, Buffett noted that railroads were a very ""cost-effective way"" to move goods, while releasing ""far fewer pollutants into the atmosphere."" After spending so much time with Buffett, the appreciation of trains must have rubbed off. The Gates Foundation owns nearly 55 million shares of Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI) valued at $6.9 billion.', ""It's easy to see the allure. Railroads are viewed as a linchpin of economic prosperity and are much more efficient for moving goods than competing methods, including trucking. Add to that a long operating history, wide economic moat, and steep barriers to entry, and you have the recipe for the perfect Buffett stock — and, by extension, a perfect Gates stock as well."", ""Finally, Canadian National has consistently increased its dividend for 18 consecutive years and currently yields 1.9%. Its relatively low payout ratio of 37% suggests there's likely plenty more where that came from."", ""One person's trash is another person's treasure, so the saying goes. In some cases, however, there's a treasure to be found in the trash. Such is the case with Waste Management (NYSE: WM). That likely explains the Gates Foundation's stake of more than 35 million shares of Waste Management stock valued at $6.3 billion."", ""Collection services for trash and recycling may not be the most exciting business, but the need is consistent and it isn't going away anytime soon. Furthermore, the company is harvesting gas from its landfills, which can be used to generate electricity or fuel vehicles."", ""Another attraction is the company's dividend. Waste Management has increased its dividend for 15 years running and currently yields 1.4%. And with a payout ratio of 49%, there's plenty of opportunity for future increases."", 'One common thread investors will note throughout the Gates Foundation Trust holdings is that many are dividend payers, which makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Money generated by dividend-paying stocks can be used to fund charitable giving without having to sell the underlying stocks. In fact, in 2023, the portfolio generated nearly $500 million in dividend income.', ""For investors looking to add some income to their portfolio, three of these four stocks aren't a bad place to start."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*', 'They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Microsoft made the list — but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.', 'See the 10 stocks', '*Stock Advisor returns as of February 26, 2024', ""John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Signet Jewelers is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.15 = US$623m ÷ (US$6.1b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""Thus, Signet Jewelers has an ROCE of 15%.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Signet Jewelers ."", ""Signet Jewelers has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 38% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking."", ""To sum it up, Signet Jewelers is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Since the stock has returned a staggering 357% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue."", ""Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price. That's where you can check out our  FREE intrinsic value estimation for SIG   that compares the share price and estimated value."", ""While Signet Jewelers may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

According to National Geographic, Earth is widest at its equator and runs around 40,075 kilometers (24,901 miles) distance.\xa0', ""Equatorial climate, also known as the tropical rainforest climate, usually falls upon the countries found within 10 to 15 degrees latitude of the equator. It is a tropical climate sub-type and is characterized by high temperatures of around 30 °C (86 °F), extreme humidity, abundant rainfall, and, most importantly, little to no variation in temperature throughout the year. Regions with Equatorial climates experience hot weather throughout the year as the sun remains almost directly overhead, keeping temperatures high. Also, the Earth's position and the tilt on its axis results in more direct sunlight.

The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.73 billion in the 2023 fourth quarter, 14.4% higher than net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter was 54.2% compared to 51.8% in the comparative 2022 fourth quarter.As a result of the Bang inventory step-up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $5 million during the 2023 fourth quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 54.5% for the 2023 fourth quarter, excluding the Bang inventory step-up. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter as compared to the 2022 fourth quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and lower input costs.During this call, we will talk about impairment charges of approximately $39.9 million recorded in the 2023 fourth quarter related to the Alcohol Brands segment due in part to the continuing challenges in the craft beer and seltzer categories. We will refer to these charges as the alcohol impairment charges. The alcohol impairment charges related to certain non-amortizing intangibles as well as property and equipment acquired as part of the CANarchy transaction. Operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $504.4 million compared to $390 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter included the alcohol impairment charges. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were 29.2% compared with 25.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter. Exclusive of the alcohol impairment charges as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were 26.8%.Distribution expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $79.6 million or 4.6% of net sales compared to $76.1 million or 5% of net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter.Operating income for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 10% to $434 million from $394.4 million in the 2022 comparative quarter.

The effective tax rate for the 2023 fourth quarter was 18.5% compared with 23.3% in the 2022 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in the stock compensation deduction.Net income increased 21.6% to $367 million as compared to $301.7 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Net income adjusted for the Bang inventory step-up and the alcohol impairment charges, net of tax, increased 33.1% to $401.5 million for the 2023 fourth quarter.Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 22.3% to $0.35 from $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for the Bang inventory step-up and the alcohol impairment charges, net of tax, was $0.38 for the 2023 fourth quarter, an increase of 33.8%.The company has implemented price increases in the first quarter of 2024 in certain international markets. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions in both the United States and internationally.

Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined, in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 19.9% for the month of January 2024.

Monster's market share in value decreased 1.7 points to 40.5%. Monster Energy remains the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of January 2024, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 14.9% to 16.3% in Belgium; from 31% to 31.6% in France; from 30.8% to 33.2% in Great Britain; from 4.9% to 6.2% in the Netherlands; from 32.7% to 34.4% in Norway; and from 40.5% to 40.9% in Spain.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended until the end of December 2023, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 20.1% to 22.4% in the Czech Republic; from 13.7% to 17.1% in Germany; from 30.2% to 31.1% in Italy; and from 27.6% to 30.1% in the Republic of Ireland.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of December 2023, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year remained flat at 18.6% in Poland.

Nasty Beast Hard Tea is available in 4 flavors and is available in 24-ounce single-serve cans as well as a variety 12-pack of 12-ounce sleek cans. Early response to the brand has been very positive.In the U.S., during the 2023 fourth quarter, we expanded NOS Original with a 0-sugar offering, NOS Zero Sugar.Our pipeline innovation continues in the first quarter of 2024. In January, we launched 2 additional flavors of Reign Storm, Guava Strawberry and Citrus Zest to add to the 4 flavors already in distribution. We are planning to launch 2 additional Reign Storm flavors, Apricot Strawberry and Mango in March 2024, bringing the total number of Reign Storm flavors to 8.In February, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red in 16-ounce and 12-ounce sleek cans. We also launched Monster Rehab Green Tea, Reign Total Body Fuel Sour Gummy Worm, Monster Juice Rio Punch, Java Monster Irish Cream and Monster Reserve Peaches and Cream.Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, we continue to innovate in our multipack and variety pack offerings. In Canada, during the first quarter of 2024, we launched several new innovations. In January, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams in 2 package sizes as well as Reign Total Body Fuel Cherry Limeade and Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle.In early February 2024, we launched Monster Energy Zero Sugar in a 710 ml receivable package as well as Monster Rehab Wild Berry Tea.In Latin America, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we launched several new innovations. In Brazil, we launched Monster Pipeline Punch. In Uruguay, we launched Monster Ultra Sunrise. And in Chile, we launched Monster Aussie Style Lemonade. In Colombia and Guatemala, we launched Monster Reserve White Pineapple. In Peru, we launched Fury Gold Strike, an affordable energy brand.In Latin America, during the first quarter of 2024, several new flavors have been introduced. In Mexico, we continued to expand our affordable portfolio and introduced Predator Tropical.In the 2023 fourth quarter in New Zealand, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Peachy Keen. In Australia, during the first quarter of 2024, we launched Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams and Monster Juice Papillon.In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Juice Monarch, Nitro Cosmic Peach, Reserve Orange Dreamsicle and Ultra Peachy Keen in a number of countries.

As of February 27, 2024, approximately $642.4 million remained available for purchase under the previously authorized repurchase program, that is dollars.We estimate on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the Alcohol Brands segment, January 2024 sales were approximately 20.5% higher than the comparable period January 2023 sales, and 19.7% higher than January 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment. We estimate January 2024 sales, including the Alcohol Brands segment to be approximately 17.8% higher than in January 2023 and 17% higher than in January 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment.January 2024 had one more selling day compared to January 2023. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers.Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be in future to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally. Two, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Three, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland.We have a robust innovation plan for 2024. The Beast Unleashed is performing to expectations. We're excited for Nasty Beast Hard Tea as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that Monster Brewing Company presents. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of additional countries internationally. We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands.And lastly, the company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.73 billion in the 2023 fourth quarter, 14.4% higher than net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis.I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the 2023 year. Thank you."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Peter Grom with UBS.', 'Peter K. Grom', ""I wanted to ask a question specifically on gross margin. Clearly, the quarter came in a bit better relative to some of the commentary from the investor meeting. Maybe first, did something surprise you in the quarter?And then second, just going back to that same commentary from the investor meeting, there seem to be a lot of optimism that the gross margin trajectory would improve nicely from 4Q looking out to '24. I know you don't give guidance specifically, but just any thoughts on how we should think about the margin trajectory given the very strong exit rate?"", 'Hilton H. Schlosberg', ""So I think at the investor meeting, as I recall, we already spoke about 2023 Q4. As you know, we don't give guidance, and we really do try not to give guidance. So if I could just talk about Q4 for a minute, Q4 was strong. But there were a number of really nonrecurring items included in GP in Q4, mainly related to true-ups of various promotional items, various true-ups with partners as well as -- we have a few, we don't have very many, but we have a number of rebate programs.So looking at Q4 of 2023, I would say to you that on an ongoing basis, Q4 came up very much in line with what we expected, which was an increase over Q3. And it's at the level probably of about 53.5% on a kind of stand-alone basis excluding these nonrecurring items."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Filippo Falorni with Citi.', 'Filippo Falorni', ""I wanted to ask you about the energy drink category in the U.S. We've seen a bit of a slowdown in January. How much do you think it was the weather? How much would you think we're some other external factor on the consumer? And then maybe you can comment a bit on market share trends in the U.S. We've seen a little bit of pressure on the core Monster brand. So any color you could give would be helpful."", 'Hilton H. Schlosberg', ""Yes. Firstly, I don't think one should discount the fact that the weather was a factor. Secondly, we do have a lot of nonmeasured channels. And if you heard earlier in the call, January sales were -- in my book, were really impressive, the increase in January sales. Added to that, Nielsen doesn't cover everything, as we've discussed before, and there were some interesting things in January, for example, one of the big club store chains had what we call an MVM, which is a club store chain that is not read by Nielsen, and in itself is pretty substantial.Adding to that, if you go back to January 2023, we had very robust increases mainly because of the launch of 2 brands that really hit it out of the park. One was Monster Zero Sugar and the other was Ultra Strawberry Dreams.On the call, you would have heard that our innovation for 2024 has really kicked off in February and is going through February through to March, so we didn't have the benefit of that innovation program earlier on as we did in 2023. So these are all factors that one must take into account when one examines so-called slowness in the Nielsen volumes.Also, I might add that we have a number of important resets coming up, the trade reset from January on through the early part of the second quarter. So -- and we're anticipating big gains in shelf space not only for our legacy brands, not only for the SKUs that we are about to launch, but also for the Bang brand, where a number of retailers that had hitherto really discontinued Bang because of all the litigation and all of the issues are now taking it back, and we'll see that benefit starting really in the second quarter and -- sorry, starting in the first quarter and moving into the second quarter. So there's a whole number of factors that I think are worth bearing in mind when one looks at the Nielsens, for example, in January."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.', 'Andrea Faria Teixeira', ""Just -- you said that you continue to look at opportunities for pricing in the U.S. What is preventing you to announce pricing at this point? Do you see -- I mean, obviously, the key competitor announced pricing back when we all saw you here in New York, you were talking about potentially looking at the impact of elasticities. It seems that things have been moderately positive. Is there any reason why you'd wait?And then second, Hilton, when you spoke about a normalized gross profit margin of 53.5%, should we expect margins to continue to build from here given that potentially the high 50s, it's still below where you were before the pandemic at 60. Is there any reason why these new plans would not leverage as fast or any structural reasons that you would be below the high 50s?"", 'Hilton H. Schlosberg', ""No, the only structural reason is we don't give guidance. So that's the only structural reason I can think of. Obviously, we're working on margins. I'm proud to say that the Midwest premium and aluminum, which is one of my big bug beds are coming down. But against that, we've said that we have increases in other commodities and other pricing.So we're bringing up our own manufacturing facilities up and we're doing whatever we can to improve gross profit percentages. But we don't give guidance and I don't know what's going to happen with freight, for example. We had a good benefit from freight-in this quarter -- this last quarter, and I'm not sure what's going to happen as we look forward into 2024 and the implications of the election and everything else. So that's about that.And then on pricing, we're taking pricing in a number of markets internationally. We've taken pricing in January in a number of markets. And we're moving through with an aggressive price increase program internationally. As regards to the U.S., we really are just -- we're waiting and evaluating. We run a very sizable business here. We have a number of customers that we deal with. And we want to make the right decision. So we're not saying no to a price increase, and we're not saying yes to a price increase this time. What we are saying is that we are honestly really evaluating and constantly evaluating the retail pricing environment. And if we believe there are opportunities, we will take them."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.', 'Dara Warren Mohsenian', ""So the comments on some of the U.S. performance were helpful. Just given the strength of that global January number, can you spend some time discussing what you're seeing internationally in terms of category growth and your market share progression? And any thoughts on maybe key expansion plans internationally in terms of some of your key brands and how we should think about that for 2024?"", 'Hilton H. Schlosberg', ""So Dara, on the call, we did talk about progress internationally in very great detail. I think sometimes we give far more detail than we should, but we do. We gave market shares in various countries we indicated the new product innovations that are going to happen throughout our international territories, and I'm not sure what other question -- what part of your question, we possibly have an answer. And I don't mean to be disrespectful. I just feel that a lot of your question has been covered.Rodney, I don't know if you've got anything to add."", 'Rodney Cyril Sacks', ""No. Other than the -- there's -- if you look at the international markets, they've sort of been a little bit all over the place in many ways. But generally, they've been good. There was a little bit of slowing in Asia Pacific. We're taking steps to see some growth. But obviously, we are very substantial in those markets and the actual markets have been a little flatter.But we've got great opportunity in some of the international markets that are developing. We look particularly to markets like China and India. We're at the beginning of a growth phase in India, particularly focusing on not only Monster, but also Predator there. So I think that it is mixed. Some of the markets have had some sort of ups and downs, but overall, we're in growth in most of the markets, and we still see that as very exciting. And you can see from the results in January, we're still seeing -- despite the Nielsen numbers, we're still seeing good growth in the U.S. as well."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.', 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', 'Yes. Two questions for me, if I could. The first one is just on G&A expenses in the quarter. They were up a lot relative to our expectations of almost 25% in the fourth quarter. Just anything to unpack there and anything anomalous in that number?', 'Hilton H. Schlosberg', ""Yes. We spoke about the -- sorry to interrupt, but let's just answer the first. So remember, we spoke about impairment charges of $40 million in this quarter relating to the Alcohol Brands."", 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', ""Yes. Sorry, I'm excluding that. It's still up a lot, excluding the impairment charges."", 'Hilton H. Schlosberg', ""We'll look at that, but it's not what I've been seeing."", 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', ""Okay. The second question is, in January, you highlighted plans just to step up focus on in-market execution in the U.S., specifically commercialization around placing of the full portfolio and innovation. And just any update you can share on progress made and cooperation you're getting on the -- from the Coke system on that effort?"", 'Hilton H. Schlosberg', ""Yes. I think that's not a one-fix issue. That's something that's ongoing, and we are working with the Coke bottlers to improve execution. As I said earlier, we're rolling out a number of new products and the new sets are all taking place in this first quarter from February onwards and early into the second quarter. And I think you'll see that -- well, I hope you'll see from those numbers when we report them, that the positioning should be somewhat different to where we are today."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.', 'Mark Stiefel Astrachan', ""I wanted to go back to international because I feel like it's one of those things that doesn't get the credit that's due, right? You built nearly a $3 billion run rate business at this point. And I think from the outside, it's a little bit hard to get a sense of kind of what's going on there.So not necessarily to Dara's question, but maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of number of SKUs that you have on shelf, not obviously by country, but sort of broader strokes of the opportunity you have to still develop your portfolio within those markets? How much opportunity is there broadly to develop the energy category.?And sort of related to that, margins have improved, but they're obviously still a lot lower than your domestic margins, both gross margin and EBIT margin in that international business. How do you think about improving that over time? Is that possible relative to current levels? And kind of how do you think about the progression of that?"", 'Hilton H. Schlosberg', ""We've always spoken about the fact that internationally, we compete very strongly against -- in the main Red Bull. And we really try and keep our pricing. We have a pricing strategy that's worked well for us, and that's really keeping within a particular percentage of Red Bull pricing. And the minute we stray from that, we find that our market shares really suffers.So we really have an interesting dynamic in that we have, obviously, relationships with The Coke partners. And we have a pricing structure that kind of has a ceiling, right? So it's -- while we are always on a mission to improve gross margins, and we do that on an ongoing basis, there are some areas where it is very difficult to get gross margin. And I've said this before, that I think it will be very difficult in the main to get gross margins internationally to the levels that we have enjoyed in the U.S.You can see what happened in EMEA. They nudged their margins up by 1% in the fourth quarter. And it's an ongoing battle to improve margins, bearing in mind the dynamics of what we are working against."", 'Operator', ""This concludes -- I'm sorry, go ahead, sir."", 'Rodney Cyril Sacks', ""Sorry, I just -- finish the other part of the question that Mark had raised just before we sign off.Just to talk about the international opportunity, I think what Mark is alluding to is correct. In many markets, the international markets have really followed the U.S. We have a far broader portfolio in the U.S. Innovation continues from year to year. But what -- the benefit that the international markets have is they see what we've introduced in the U.S. and the large number of additional SKUs and literally brand families we have in the U.S. And they're able to try and look to those and try and introduce selected SKUs, which gives them a very large runway.In some markets, the runway is focused on the Monster premium brands. And in some markets, the growth is coming from an affordable sector. And we have addressed that. So we have Monster in many markets, but we've also -- where we see that the premium sector has more of a limited percentage of the population that can really afford to have the buying power. We are growing, and that's where we're starting to grow brands like Predator in many international markets and that will help us continue to see growth and Predator also has a lot of depth.We were launching Predator in China this year. We've just launched Predator in India in cans. We're now just rolling out PET in India. We're trying to address some volume production issues because there's not a lot of availability, but that will sort itself out reasonably soon. And we see enormous opportunity once we get some availability for production in PET for PET in India.So there are a lot of opportunities, but they vary from market to market and continent to continent. As you know, we've just recently launch, for example, in Egypt, we launched both Monster and Predator. Predator's quickly made a name for itself as a growing brand. So we have these opportunities in different countries around the world. And so we're quite excited about seeing that.As I said, we did have some slowdown in some of the more developed countries in Asia. The category slowed, but I think that those -- we're taking steps to address and introduce more and different innovation in those markets and to grow them. So we do look forward to having a really attractive runway around the world for us."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.', 'Rodney Cyril Sacks', ""On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottler system. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy, and thank you very much for your attendance."", 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HST.', ""Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST), the largest publicly traded lodging real estate investment trust (REIT), released its 10-K filing on February 28, 2024, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial condition and results of operations. With a consolidated portfolio of 77 luxury and upper-upscale hotels, Host Hotels & Resorts Inc stands as a dominant player in the U.S. lodging market. The company's financial tables reveal a robust balance sheet, with a focus on maintaining an investment-grade rating and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. The strategic divestment of European and Asian joint venture interests, alongside the active management of its U.S. portfolio, underscores Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's commitment to optimizing asset value and shareholder returns."", ""Brand Power and Market Presence: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's portfolio predominantly features luxury and upper-upscale hotels, operating under esteemed brands such as Marriott and Starwood. This brand affiliation not only enhances the company's market visibility but also provides a competitive edge in attracting high-value clientele. The strategic focus on these chain scales is supported by the company's strong performance in key markets, which is indicative of a loyal customer base and a robust brand reputation."", ""Financial Resilience: The company's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and prudent fiscal management. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc maintains an investment-grade balance sheet, which is a critical factor in ensuring access to capital at favorable terms. The strong capital structure, coupled with a disciplined capital recycling program, positions the company to navigate market fluctuations effectively and pursue growth opportunities."", ""Geographic Concentration: While Host Hotels & Resorts Inc benefits from a geographically diverse portfolio within the United States, the recent divestitures in Europe and Asia may limit its global footprint and exposure to international markets. This concentration in the U.S. market could potentially amplify the impact of domestic economic downturns on the company's performance."", 'Operational Constraints: As a REIT, Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is subject to stringent regulations that restrict its ability to directly manage and operate hotels. This reliance on third-party hotel managers could lead to challenges in maintaining consistent service quality and operational control across its properties.', ""Strategic Acquisitions: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strong balance sheet and capital allocation strategy position it to take advantage of acquisition opportunities. The company's focus on iconic upper-upscale and luxury properties in markets with high growth potential presents a significant opportunity to enhance its portfolio and drive long-term shareholder value."", ""Value Enhancement Initiatives: The company's commitment to ROI projects and value enhancement initiatives, such as hotel expansions and green building certifications, offers a pathway to improve asset value and operational efficiency. These projects are designed to reposition Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's hotels within their markets, potentially leading to increased competitiveness and profitability."", ""Market Cyclicality: The lodging industry is inherently cyclical, with demand closely tied to the overall economic climate. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's performance, like that of its peers, is vulnerable to economic downturns that can lead to decreased travel and lodging demand, ultimately impacting revenue and profitability."", 'Competitive Landscape: The rise of alternative lodging options, such as short-term rentals facilitated by online platforms, poses a threat to traditional hotel operators. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate this evolving competitive landscape and adapt its strategies to maintain market share and customer loyalty.', 'In conclusion, Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) exhibits a strong market presence and financial resilience, underpinned by a portfolio of well-regarded luxury and upper-upscale hotels. However, the company faces challenges related to geographic concentration and operational constraints. Looking ahead, Host Hotels & Resorts Inc has the opportunity to expand its portfolio through strategic acquisitions and enhance asset value through targeted investments. Nevertheless, the company must remain vigilant in the face of economic cyclicality and a competitive market that includes emerging lodging alternatives. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats in the dynamic lodging industry.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Both companies recently reported financial results for 2023 that were far better than expected, and there's reason to believe that momentum will continue."", ""Here's why it's not too late to buy these two unstoppable stocks."", 'Netflix has long set the standard in the video streaming industry. It had 260.8 million subscribers at the end of 2023, which is more than any other platform.', ""And 13.1 million of those subscribers were added in the recent fourth quarter alone, a record number for the period. That gain also crushed Wall Street analysts' estimate of 9 million."", 'Netflix owes its recent success to a series of changes it made over the last couple of years to acquire more paying customers. First, it cracked down on password sharing to monetize some of the estimated 100 million global households that were borrowing Netflix from a friend or family member for free. Second, it introduced a cheaper subscription tier supplemented by advertising, to draw in new users who might want a lower price point.', ""And it continues to invest heavily in content. Earlier this year, the company announced a deal with TKO Group Holdings to acquire the global broadcast rights to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

So it's probably not too late to buy the stock."", ""Like Netflix, Spotify is also at the top of its streaming field. It's the largest music streaming and podcasting platform in the world, and after expanding into audiobooks around 18 months ago, it's already ranked second behind Amazon's Audible in that segment."", ""Music isn't quite like TV shows and movies. Spotify and its competitors, like Apple Music, are basically content distributors for the major labels, not creators. Therefore, each platform offers a very similar content catalog, so they have to compete on other things like technology instead."", 'Spotify continues to develop artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance content recommendations for users.

It cut 1,500 jobs in December (17% of its workforce), which followed 800 cuts earlier in the year.

Fans and authors mingled in a brand new Science Fiction Museum, designed by the prestigious Zaha Hadid Architects in the shape of a huge steel starburst over a lake.', 'But three months later, much of that goodwill turned sour as a scandal erupted over allegations that organizers of the Hugo awards — sci-fi’s biggest prize, awarded at Worldcon — disqualified candidates to placate Chinese censors.', 'The event embodied the contradictions that Chinese science fiction has faced for decades. In 40 years, it’s gone from a politically suspect niche to one of China’s most successful cultural exports, with author Liu Cixin gaining an international following that includes fans like Barack Obama and Mark Zuckerberg.

Please review our press release for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as the full safe harbor statements included in the Investors section of our website, tjx.com. We have also detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and in the Investors section of tjx.com, along with reconciliations to non-GAAP measures we discuss. Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Ernie."", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is John. I want to start today by recognizing all of our global associates for their excellent work in 2023. I truly appreciate their continued commitment to TJX and their focus on our customers. I especially want to thank our store, distribution and fulfillment center associates for their hard work and dedication to our company every day. Now to an overview of our results beginning with the fourth quarter. I am extremely pleased with our very strong finish to 2023. Our fourth quarter sales profitability and earnings per share all exceeded our expectations. Overall comp sales were up a strong 5% and were entirely driven by growth in customer transactions. This is great to see as it underscores our ability to continue gaining market share in all of our geographies. I am particularly pleased that our U.S. businesses, Marmaxx and HomeGoods, continued their very strong sales momentum. Also, it was great to see comp sales growth accelerate versus the third quarter at our Canadian and international divisions. We are confident that our exciting assortments and excellent values resonated with shoppers across all of our retail banners this holiday season. We believe our gift-giving selections offer customers something for everyone on their list, and we see being a gift-giving destination as a year-round opportunity for our business. For the full year, overall sales surpassed $50 billion, marking a milestone for our company. Even more exciting, we still see plenty of opportunities to continue our growth in our markets around the world. For the full year, consolidated comp sales increased 5%. Profitability increased significantly and earnings per share grew double digits, all well above our initial guidance for the year. Importantly, we saw comp sales growth across each of our divisions, again, all driven by increases in customer transactions. We are confident that we gain market share in every geography that we operate in. Our outstanding performance in 2023 is a testament to the sharp execution of our talented associates around the world and their relentless focus on delivering excellent value to our customers every day. Looking ahead, the first quarter is off to a good start. In 2024, we have many initiatives planned that we believe will keep driving sales and to attract more shoppers to our stores. Availability of quality branded merchandise in the marketplace continues to be outstanding. We are in a terrific position to continue flowing a fresh assortment of goods to our stores and online this spring and throughout the year. Longer term, we see many opportunities to capture additional market share across our geographies, and we are laser focused on increasing the profitability of TJX. We are convinced that our flexibility and commitment to value will continue to be a winning retail formula for many years to come. Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our fourth quarter and full year financial results in more detail."", 'John Klinger', ""Thanks, Ernie. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work. Now I'll share some additional details on the fourth quarter. As I recap the fourth quarter results, I'm going to speak to everything on a 13-week basis, which excludes the extra week in the quarter. Reconciliations detailing the impact of the extra week on our results and other adjustments can be found in today's press release and on the Investors section of our website. Adjusted net sales grew to $15.5 billion, a 7% increase versus last year. As Ernie mentioned, consolidated comp store sales increased 5%, above the high end of our plan and were entirely driven by an increase in customer transactions. A quick note that on prior calls, we have referred to customer transactions as customer traffic. But for the sake of clarity, we'll use the term customer transactions going forward. Back to the results. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated comp sales increased in both our apparel and home businesses. In terms of divisional sales performance for the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see strong comp sales increases at every division, all driven entirely by customer transactions. At Marmaxx, I also note that we saw comp increases in both our apparel and home categories. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax profit margin of 10.9% was up 170 basis points versus last year. Our adjusted pretax profit margin came in well above our plan primarily due to a higher merchandise margin. This includes a larger-than-expected benefit from shrink and freight, lower markdowns and better mark on. We also saw some expense leverage on our above-plan sales. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 340 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a higher merchandise margin, including a significant benefit from lower freight costs and shrink strong mark-on and lower markdowns. Fourth quarter adjusted SG&A increased 190 basis points versus last year, primarily due to higher incentive accruals and incremental store wage and payroll costs. Adjusted net interest income benefited fourth quarter adjusted pretax profit margin by 10 basis points versus last year. Lastly, we were very pleased that adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.12 were well above our expectations and up 26% versus last year. Now to our fiscal '24 results. Once again, for the full -- for our full year financial results, I'm going to speak to everything on a 52-week basis, which excludes the extra week in the fiscal year. Adjusted net sales grew to $53.3 billion, a 7% increase versus last year. Full year consolidated comp store sales were up 5%, entirely driven by customer transactions. We were very pleased to see mid-single-digit comp sales increases in both our apparel and home businesses. Adjusted pretax profit margin of 10.9% was up 120 basis points versus last year's adjusted 9.7%. Adjusted gross margin for the full year was 29.9%, up 230 basis points versus last year's 27.6%, primarily driven by a significant benefit from lower freight costs as well as strong mark-on and 10 basis points of shrink favorability. Shrink was an area that we were laser focused on as an organization all year long. I want to recognize and thank all the associates who worked extremely hard on our initiatives throughout the year. Importantly, we managed our in-store initiatives while delivering a very strong top line and providing a pleasant shopping experience for our customers. We remain focused on shrink and continue to look for ways to improve this area going forward. Full year adjusted SG&A was 19.3%, up 140 basis points versus last year's 17.9%. This was primarily due to incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals. Adjusted net interest income benefited full year adjusted pretax profit margin by 30 basis points versus last year. Lastly, full year adjusted earnings per share were $3.76, up 21% versus last year's adjusted $3.11. Moving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was up 3% versus fiscal '23. We are happy with our inventory levels and the plentiful availability we see in the marketplace. We are well positioned to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this spring. I'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. For the full 53-week year, we generated $6.1 billion in operating cash flow and ended the year with $5.6 billion in cash. In fiscal '24, we returned $4 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. Now I'll turn it back to Ernie."", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Thanks, John. I'll pick it up with some full year divisional highlights. As we saw with our strong fourth quarter sales, every division delivered comp increases for the full year, with customer transactions driving the increases across the businesses. Again, we believe this is a strong indicator of our ability to continue gaining market share and it underscores our wide customer demographic. Beginning with Marmaxx. Overall sales well exceeded $30 billion. Comp store sales increased a very strong 6%. We also surpassed 2,500 total T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores. Marmaxx's apparel and home categories, both comped up for the year. Further, we saw consistently strong comp sales increases across regions and income demographics. As to Marmaxx's profitability, we were extremely pleased to see full year adjusted segment profit margin improved significantly to 13.7%. As we look ahead, we are very excited about the opportunities to see -- that we see to grow our customer base, drive sales, open new stores and increase the profitability of our largest division. At Sierra, which is reported with Marmaxx, we were pleased with the continued sales growth. At our online businesses, we added new categories and brands throughout the year to deliver the same freshness and excitement online as we do in our stores. At HomeGoods, annual sales grew to nearly $9 billion and comps grew 3%. It was great to see the home business return to positive comp sales trends. We are particularly pleased with the acceleration we saw in the second half of the year, with comp sales increasing high single digits. Similar to Marmaxx, we saw consistent performance across regions and income demographics. HomeGoods adjusted profitability also improved significantly to 9.4% and getting closer to our goal of returning this division to a double-digit profit margin. During the year, we opened a combined 34 HomeGoods and HomeSense stores. Long term, we see exciting potential to bring our eclectic mix of home fashions to even more consumers across the United States. Moving to TJX Canada. Full year sales were $5 billion and comp store sales increased 3%. Adjusted segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 14%. With more than 550 stores across Canada, we are one of the largest apparel and home retailers in the country. We are a top destination for consumers seeking branded merchandise at amazing value. We continue to see opportunities to expand our footprint across Canada and attract new shoppers to all 3 of our banners. At TJX International. Full year sales approached $7 billion and comp store sales were up 3%. Adjusted segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 4.6%. As a reminder, in the second quarter, this division's profitability was significantly impacted by a reserve related to a German government COVID receivable. In Europe, we believe our sales growth outperformed many other major brick-and-mortar apparel retailers in a difficult economy. Australia delivered very strong sales growth, and we continue to open stores and new markets. Going forward, we are confident that we can grow our retail banners in each country that we operate in and are highly focused on improving this division's profitability. Going forward, I am confident that we are well positioned to continue our growth around the world and in many kinds of economic and retail environments. Let me briefly remind you of the key characteristics of our business that we believe are tremendous advantage. First is our relentless focus on offering our shoppers great value on every item every day. For us, value means delivering consumers the right combination of brand, fashion, price and quality as always. Second is the flexibility of our business model that allows us to shift our buying, distribution and store mix to quickly react to the hottest trends in the marketplace and changing consumer preferences. Further, the globalness of our business allows us to create a differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience in every country that we operate in. Third, we successfully operate stores across a wide customer demographic. Our ability to offer a differentiated mix of good, better and best merchandise at each of our stores allows us to appeal to value-conscious shoppers across a broad range of income demographics. Further, each of our divisions continue to affect an outsized number of younger customers to its stores, attract an outsized number of younger customers to our stores, which we believe bodes well for the future. Next, we are extremely confident that there is more than enough inventory available in the marketplace to support our growth plans. In 2023, our more than 1,300 buyers source goods from a universe of more than 21,000 vendors, including thousands of new ones. As we continue to grow our top line, we believe we become even more appealing to vendors as we offer them an attractive way to grow their business. Fifth, we continue to see opportunities for store growth around the world. We believe we can grow our global store base by at least another 1,300-plus stores over the long term with just our existing banners in our current countries. Last, but certainly not least, is our exceptional talent and strong culture. I truly believe the depth of off-price knowledge and expertise and the longevity of our talent within TJX is unmatched. We continue to invest in teaching and training our associates to develop the next generation of leaders within our company. Finally, I am so proud of our culture, which I believe is a major differentiator and another key component of our success. Turning to corporate responsibility. Our teams across the company did great work on our initiatives in each of our 4 pillars: workplace, communities, environment and responsible business. Our 2023 global corporate responsibility report summarizes our efforts and progress within this work, as I shared last quarter. Our value mission extends to our corporate responsibility efforts, including supporting our associates, giving back in our communities, helping mitigate our impact on the environment and operating our business ethically. I'm pleased to share that in fiscal 2024, we supported more than 2,000 nonprofit organizations globally through our TJX foundations including nonprofit partners in all 50 states within the United States. Through our grant funding and in partnership with our generous customers, we provided more than 30 million meals through our nonprofit partners that people experiencing food and security. And our associates across the globe continue to be engaged in this work, running give a dollar campaigns in our stores, participating in our associate nominated grants program, helping to build homes for those in need, serving his career coaches for students and more. These are just some examples of work our teams are doing in our communities, and we invite you to visit tjx.com to learn more. Summing up, we are very proud of our team's performance in 2023 and are in a great position as we enter 2024. We are confident in our plans this year, and as always, we'll strive to beat them. We remain committed to investing in our business to support our future growth. Longer term, we believe that the combination of our key strengths and history of strong execution sets us up extremely well to continue our successful growth around the world. I am convinced that plenty of opportunities remain to drive sales increased profitability and capture additional market share going forward. Now I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and first quarter guidance. And then we'll open it up for questions."", 'John Klinger', ""Thanks again, Ernie. Now to our fiscal '25 guidance beginning with the full year. We are planning overall comp store sales growth to be up 2% to 3% in fiscal '25 over a 5% comp increase in fiscal '24. For the full year, we expect consolidated sales to be in the range of $55.6 million to $56.1 billion. We're planning full year pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.9% to 11%. This would be flat to up 10 basis points versus fiscal '24 adjusted pretax profit margin of 10.9%. Moving to full year gross margin. We expect it to be in the range of 30% to 30.1%, a 10 to 20 basis point increase versus fiscal '24 as adjusted gross margin of 29.9%. We expect this increase to be driven by a higher merchandise margin partially offset by our supply chain investments. We're planning for both freight and shrink to be flat versus fiscal '24. For full year SG&A, we're expecting it to be approximately 19.3% and flat to last year's adjusted SG&A. We're planning incremental store wage and payroll costs to be offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a benefit from items that negatively impacted us last year. We're planning full year net interest income of about $118 million, which would delever fiscal '25 pretax profit by about 10 basis points. For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a full year tax rate of 26.0% and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.14 billion shares. As a result of these assumptions, we're -- we expect full year earnings per share to be in the range of $3.94 to $4.02. This would represent an increase of 5% to 7% versus last year's adjusted earnings per share of $3.76. Moving to our first quarter guidance. We are planning overall comp store sales growth to be up 2% to 3%. We expect first quarter consolidated sales to be in the range of $12.4 billion to $12.5 billion. We're planning first quarter pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.5% to 10.6%, an increase of 20 to 30 basis points versus last year. Next, we expect first quarter gross margin to be approximately 29.8%. This would be an increase of 90 basis points versus last year's -- last year primarily due to a higher merchandise margin which includes the annualization of lower freight costs from last year and favorable mark-on, partially offset by supply chain investments. We're expecting first quarter SG&A to be approximately 19.5%, up 50 basis points versus last year. We expect this increase to be primarily driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs. For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a first quarter tax rate of 25.8%, net interest income of about $37 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.14 billion shares. As a result of these assumptions, we expect for our first quarter earnings to be -- earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.86, up 11% to 13% versus last year's $0.76. Moving on to our fiscal '25 capital plans. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. This includes opening new stores, remodels and relocations as well as investments in our distribution network and infrastructure to support our growth. For new stores, we plan to add about 141 net new stores, which would bring our year-end total to almost 5,100 stores. This would represent a store growth of about 3%. In the U.S., our plans call for us to add about 45 net new stores in Marmaxx and 40 stores at HomeGoods, including 17 HomeSense stores. At Sierra, we plan to add 26 stores. In Canada, we plan to add 10 stores. And at TJX International, we plan to add 15 net stores, in Europe and 5 net stores in Australia. Lastly, we also plan to remodel about 480 stores and relocate approximately 40 stores in fiscal '25. As to our fiscal '25 cash distribution plans, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. As we outlined in today's press release, we expect our Board of Directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.375 per share. Additionally, in fiscal '25, we currently expect to buy back $2 billion to $2.5 billion of TJX stock. Looking beyond FY '25, we continue to believe that on a 3 to 4 comp increase, our pretax profit margin can be flat to up 10 basis points. As I've said before, this assumes no outsized expense headwinds. Also, our plans do not contemplate assumptions for macro factors such as geopolitical events, foreign exchange volatility or consumer behavior. In closing, I want to emphasize that we are laser-focused on growing our top line, increasing profitability and will strive to exceed our plans. We are in an excellent position, both operationally and financially to take advantage of the opportunities we see to further grow our business while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders. Now we are happy to take your questions. As we do every quarter, we're going to ask that you please limit your questions to 1 per person so we can keep the call on schedule and answer as many questions as we can. Thanks, and now we'll open up for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup.', 'Paul Lawrence Lejuez', ""You've got your margin guidance overall for the year, but I'm curious how you're thinking about profit margins at each of the segments this year? Where do you have the most opportunity? And what is assumed in your guidance, which segments are up, which are down? And then, Ernie, just having quick comments on the Macy's news yesterday, how you're thinking about the store closure opportunity, what that might mean for you guys?"", 'John Klinger', ""Yes. Paul, to start off, on this call, we're not going to get into the detail by division, just to say that we're very confident in the plans we have to execute them, and we're pleased to be increasing 10 basis points on a 2% to 3% comp."", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Yes. Yes. Paul, on the -- interesting, the Macy's store closure. This is a little similar to some of the other closures we've talked about over the last few years. Obviously, with the Macy's store closures, you do have a lot of overlap in categories that marry up, which marry up to the businesses that we run. So we would think that would be an additional, and it's probably what you're getting at. I'm guessing an additional market share opportunity depending on the categories and the locations they're in. So not that we would -- not that we would get all of that, but we would get some of it is what we always figure. And again, we've looked at that with any of the other stores over the last 18, 24 months that have closed, and we look at it similarly. I also think where our teams, I like to give is -- I like to give our planning and allocation organization, a lot of credit because they look for trends and our system is sophisticated enough to look for the trends in nearby store closures and how they affect our store in a HomeGoods or a Marmaxx store, and then we're able to watch that trend and ship back and capitalize on the market share opportunity. One indirect byproduct and I know you're not asking this, but I would like to mention to everyone on the call, one of the things that's happening with all the store closures is the importance to the vendor community keeps rising for our merchants amidst less brick-and-mortar competition, so to speak. So one of the -- that hasn't been a question yet because we're not there in the order. But merchandise margin opportunities, I think one of the benefits as we look forward is the importance that our buyers have to the vendor community. And that is one of the things that probably will continue to allow us to buy a little bit better on an ongoing basis. So it's indirectly related to the store closure question. I thought I'd point that out."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs."", 'Brooke Siler Roach', ""Ernie, you talked a little bit about this already about the opportunity for better buying which could help merch margin. But I was hoping if you could contextualize the drivers of merch margin expansion that you're forecasting this year as well as the drivers of expansion that you see on a multiyear basis, is this year a function of mark on markdown or further price increases, where do you see the most opportunity?"", 'Ernie L. Herrman', 'Yes. Great. question, Brooke. And John, are you going to...', 'John Klinger', ""Yes. I mean we see a combination of both mark-on and markdown favorability in FY '25. So we're quite pleased to see that."", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""I would tell you, Brooke, getting even a little more specific for your question is where the mark on, I think, comes which is still your, I guess, most important component here because we can kind of control that is it's a combination. What I just started to touch on with Paul's question on the buying better. Also linked with that, I didn't get to mention is clearly availability, which I did mention in the script, is outstanding across the board, as always, it varies by category and vendor. But at the end of the day, there's more goods out there than we can handle, and we're still holding our merchants back. What I like that's happened, and it's been -- this is a new thing. It's been happening over a number of years now is the importance that our buyers are to the vendor community. And the way they handle the vendors in a very courteous manner, but straightforward is allowing them to continue to buy better season after season. And I think as we continue to gain market share and the vendors see that they're just being placed in our store and an eclectic mix with even more and more better brands has been an incentive for them to continue to want to work with our buyers even more so than in the past. And obviously, this has been evolving over a number of years now. So we feel good about the mark on from the buying better perspective. And then I think you touched on this on the retailing of the goods, we still feel there's opportunity. Again, we've just started over the last few years on as we used to call it, selectively adjusting retails where it was appropriate, and we still think there's a lot of opportunity there. Our perception on value is at a very high level across all of our brands. And as you can see from our sales momentum, the customers are responding extremely well to the values that we have in the store. So I would tell you on the side -- John mentioned the markdowns, so that's one thing. I think the mark on opportunities still exist because of both buying better and retailing goods. And I think, again, continues to be midterm and longer-term opportunity. I hope that answers that."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan."", 'Matthew Robert Boss', 'And congrats on another great quarter. So Ernie, with holiday comps driven by transactions, could you elaborate on new customer acquisition and market share opportunity that you see. And just how do you think your apparel and home assortments are positioned in the spring, given the good start that you cited? And then maybe, John, on the margin side, just a follow-up. I mean, with margins now exceeding prepandemic is there any change to the historical margin flow-through on incremental of plan sales? It sounds like Ernie walked through a number of drivers, but just thinking about incremental sales and flow through in the model?', 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Yes, Matt, great question. Well, first, let's deal with the first one, which is the new customer acquisition. We've been very happy. We are skewing -- we continue to skew with new customers, we continue to skew a little younger, which is what we wanted. It bodes well for the future. I think I also mentioned that in the script. One other focus, though, and I think we had this recently at the meeting up where we talked about is we also are trying to acquire new customers, but we're trying to, in our market and create additional visits out of our existing customers because that is still a huge driver of market share is if we could get one additional visit out of only 10% of our customers, that is a monster. So yes, we are obviously looking for new customers and happy that they're skewing younger and where -- we've been happy with the acquisition of new customers. But just so we get equally. We are -- we have challenged the organization to try to increase visits. And our marketing team, we just had a bunch -- and I'm thrilled with what our marketing team has done on their creative for this coming year. We have some great creative and great messaging plans across each brand. I recently had marketing meetings for a couple of weeks with every division, and we love the messaging where we're going out. And in some cases, appealing to what you just mentioned, new customers, some of our messages are really geared at educating a customer what our price is in the messaging so that we can try to get those new customers. One other thing I'd like to point out on this, that's really encouraging. We always talk about how we trade broadly. And in the call here, we've talked about different income demographics. A really neat thing, I think, for everyone to remember is we are very balanced actually relative to the population of the United States we are balanced on age and income demographics in a very appropriate manner. We're not -- as some retailers can skew towards different categories, we actually are at the point now where we over-index in the age 18 to 34. So we're slightly over the population average with those shopping our stores, which I think bodes really well for the future. And then on income demographics, we're very balanced by category under $50,000, $50,000 to $99,000 over a 100. We skew a little bit more to the -- over the $50,000 and above that. So great question. Obviously, we spent a lot of time on it. So the second part..."", 'John Klinger', ""Yes. I would just say on the income demographic, when you look at our sales performance in the fourth quarter was very consistent across our income demographic bands that we look at, particularly in the U.S. divisions. But yes, as far as the sales incremental flow through, I would say that we -- it's very consistent with what we've been saying all along. We see our lever point somewhere between the 3 to 4 comp, as we said in the script. And I don't think anything has changed on that."", 'Ernie L. Herrman', 'And Matt, what was the last part of your question? Was that about our go forward? Was it about the home business?', 'Matthew Robert Boss', 'Yes, just opportunities. You mentioned spring off to a good start. Just any elaborating on your assortments in apparel and home into the spring.', 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Apparel at home, you had said right. So yes. I have to tell you, though, we did not -- we were not -- at the beginning of February, we were getting here with the weather that I think many of you know across the country. So we -- that was holding back our comps a little in the first couple of weeks of February even though we were -- it's in our guidance range. And then over the last -- really the last couple of weeks, our business got stronger when the weather was more normalized. From week 3 on, we were -- we were much happier with our comps. So that's why we're off to a good start. And by the way, I would say that we when -- the weather is like that, it can affect your apparel, but we were still pretty pleased with where we were trending given the weather. And our home business, I would tell you, again, I don't want to take up too much more time on this section, but our home business as you could tell from Q4. And as we go into spring and this year, as I mentioned in the script, we just feel just a massive opportunity in market share because our home business, we do it so differently than really anybody else. We don't have competition the same way, whether it's all the fashion aspects of what we do in our home, some of the categories that are more replenishment, where we increasing our steady traffic in HomeGoods because we have items that customers replenish. And then you have utilitarian items that we sell. So HomeGoods is such an eclectic treasure hunt that it's really a special place in terms of impulse buying and I think just a huge market share opportunity there. And we're positioned -- I love the way that team is positioned. And that isn't just -- I'm not talking just about HomeGoods. I'm talking about the home area in Marmaxx has been really strong home area over in T.K. Maxx and in winners, Marshalls in Canada, all the full family stores have been running a strong home business, and it's also continuing that way as we enter spring."", 'John Klinger', ""Yes. And Matt, let me just add on to what I was talking about as far as the incremental sales flow-through. So as we said in the past, it's for every point in comp, 15 basis points. And again, unchanged from what we've been saying."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. ."", 'Lorraine Corrine Maikis Hutchinson', ""Ernie, I was hoping to get your outlook for pricing for this year. Do you still see an opportunity for like-for-like price increases throughout the assortment? And then also, how will mix factor into your outlook for total AUR in fiscal '25?"", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Sure. No, both on point there, Lorraine. Yes. No, we feel there's still opportunity on the like-for-like pricing. As we look -- we comp shop so regularly, our buyers are so good at that. And we can see specific items here and there where we could be going up a price point. Again, it's -- you would never notice it because we're not -- we're doing it so sparingly throughout the assortment. It isn't -- it isn't a widespread thing, but there's enough that there's opportunity to be doing it surgically in different places throughout the store. We can just see because other retailers have had to go up, and they aren't coming down even though inflation has moderated. So much cost, John and I talk about all the time cost is embedded in all of the businesses out there. So I think that, Lorraine, is going to still continue for a while. This isn't just a season or this year thing. Yes. And then the -- I'm sorry, the second part was the mix. Was it mix really? Yes. So the mix is always -- we are always going after the hottest trending mix. I don't -- in our plans right now on our AUR, we don't see the AUR changing that much. We've been kind of going after some of the hotter categories and taking down some of the ones that aren't. And as you know, you know us well. We move very fast to the trends. So we still see some of those categories that were looking good that we were trying to maximize last year continuing this year. And in our plans right now, we're looking at the AURs as not changing that much, actually. We can always go. We don't top -- that's one -- as we talk about this all the time, we do not top-down manage that. But for what we see, our visibility right now looks like they won't change much."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Jay Sole from UBS."", 'Jay Daniel Sole', ""I'd like to ask about maybe some of the smaller banners. Just on HomeSense, there's a lot of talk in the market that some home categories broadly across the U.S. aren't doing that well. But I've said a couple of times, Home is doing really well. Can you just talk about HomeSense? How that's doing, what your store opening plans for next year are? And also just because you mentioned on the script, this Sierra Trading Post, do you plan to open more Sierra Trading Post? And can you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in that banner?"", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Definitely. So John is looking at the stores. One thing I'll go -- I'm going to tell you one thing on the HomeSense mix. We make adjustments just -- it's interesting. Just similar to what I was just saying to Lorraine, we will go with where the customer is voting. Again, our model allows us to do this, and our teams are experienced. So we are in the process and actually they started in the fourth quarter. The HomeSense team has started modifying the mix to go to what's more happening than some of the other categories that have not been -- that are big in HomeSense but that haven't been trending as strongly, and we started shifting and shoring up our HomeSense trend now has picked up dramatically since we made those adjustments. So -- by the way, in our Sierra sales trend all last year was strong, and we've been thrilled with where we're heading there, which is why in both of these situations where pretty aggressive on store comp."", 'John Klinger', ""Yes. I mean we're really pleased with what we're seeing in our -- we'll call them their seed businesses that we're adding 17 HomeSense stores. We're adding 26 stores in Sierra. And we're also very pleased with what we're seeing in Australia as well, where we're adding 5 stores down there. So we're really quite pleased with what we're seeing with the performance of these businesses."", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""(inaudible) because we don't get to talk about the small businesses often, so that's good."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of John Kernan from TD Cowen."", 'John David Kernan', ""Excellent. Congrats on a great [holiday]. John, you talked about unit growth within the guidance in fiscal '25. And just within the context of your long-term store targets and also some of the trends within new store productivity as you open new Marmaxx and HomeGoods stores. How should we think about real estate availability also the long-term outlook for stores?"", 'John Klinger', ""Yes. I mean -- so right now, the what we see in total is unchanged. It's just almost just under 6,300 stores we see as the potential. And as far as store availability, we play -- we want to make sure that the stores that we're opening across all our banners are the right stores for what we -- for us. So we're not necessarily going to pick a number and then shoot for that number. We make sure that the stores we're looking at fit right within our store mix. And we're quite pleased with the performance when they do open. So when we see these store openings performance, we're quite pleased with that as well. The other thing that gives us that really works well with us are the relocations that we do. So this year, we're planning 40 relocations. And here, we're actually finding better locations in the store trading areas that we're in for stores that are coming due as far as leases. So we're able to relocate those stores to the better shopping pitch in the area. So we see a definite improvement in the performance as we do move those stores. In Europe, we see more opportunity in Germany to open up stores and in the U.K. for more of our relocations. And in the U.S. and Canada, we're also -- as we see more department stores close we see the opportunity to -- if we don't have stores in those areas to put stores in some of those areas to be the department stores of that. So we're seeing opportunities there for new store growth. So that's kind of what we're seeing for the strategy."", 'John David Kernan', ""Understood. I guess one quick follow-up would be just on other categories outside of apparel, home, you spoke about quite a bit on the prior question. Just what about beauty. It feels like it's much more elevated in-store than has been in the past. What's the opportunity within beauty and the elevation of that category?"", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Yes, I'll jump in here, John. Yes, the beauty business is obviously, you can see from the presentation in the store that's been very healthy for us. And I would tell you, we see big upside there, obviously. And we're continuing to go after that. We have done something with the presentation, but you've seen the assortments expand as well. So as you can imagine, that's one of the businesses we feel has a lot more upside. If you look at things that go along with that health and wellness and beauty thing, some of those other categories in the store, obviously kind of go along with that, if you know what I mean. So beauty is the more noticeable one you're calling out, but that trend kind of spills over, I would say, to some other categories in the store that we're going after. And I think we've talked about this before. We don't just do it we love that our stores are very flexible. So you're bringing out beauty. One thing you probably noticed is the way we've done the beauty thing we still can flex the departments around it. And so that is an advantage. Again, as always, I'd like to point that out, when our buyers are able to -- in our planning organization, we're able to go after the [HUD] business and flex it in the store very quickly, and it doesn't take as much labor or capital to redo the stores because there aren't any walls, et cetera. So great question now."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley."", 'Alexandra Ann Straton', ""Perfect. I wanted to focus on the HomeGoods real quick here. So ended the year at just under a 10% margin. I was wondering if you could speak to kind of what's constraining that business below your long-term goal of low double digits and when you think it gets there. And then secondly, just on the ability to take market share over time. Just wondering if there's any color you could provide on particular categories or changes in the market landscape that are going to enable that going forward?"", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Yes. So I mean I'll start off. Yes. So with Home Goods, I mean it's a couple of things. I mean HomeGoods was impacted by freight more than some of the other divisions. But for HomeGoods, it's about continuing to drive that top line sales growth, while well, looking at the cost structure of that freight and continuing to try to be as efficient as possible on that freight line. The HomeGoods team executes very, very well, and it's just about continuing to focus on execution, drive that top line and be as efficient as we can."", 'John Klinger', ""And Alex, if you look when you're asking about one of the things that's going to also help with the margin is the market share and sales growth opportunity that we strongly believe that we have there. If you look at -- if you look at the year that we had there in HomeGoods, dramatic first half to second half. And then even as you went to Q4, you could see how powerful the HomeGoods sales trend is relative to competition. And so it's an unusual thing when the home business years ago, we've had really strong HomeGoods and home trends for years. Typically, yes, we'd be outpacing competition, but not as dramatically as recently. And so that just shows you that the market share, which is, I think, like a third part of your question, the market share is really up for grabs. And fortunately, what's going on, I think, in the landscape is you have the e-comm players on home as well as the brick-and-mortar are creating additional opportunity for our home business because of their execution and their lack of excitement. We do believe -- like our Marmaxx, we believe HomeGoods is one of the most exciting store shopping experiences on the planet, really. And you've seen whether you look on TikTok or any of the -- with third-party endorsements that come out on different talk shows had segments on HomeGoods lately. It's become a -- it's become a bit of a cult because people know that you can't go in there and spend less than a couple of hundred dollars, even though you're planning on doing it just for a bed pillow. So it's -- that's why we're so bullish. We also corporately, it's one of our most collaborative arenas. Our home merchants are so linked up across all the organizations, which is why we're bullish on total TJX Home business which, as you know, we've talked in the past, over 1/3 of our business will be home business in TJX this year, heading to a higher percentage over the next few years, that's what we believe. So you're touching on it, what I think is a competitive advantage and future continuing to be traffic driver for TJX."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of [Michael Binetti] from Evercore ISI."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Congrats on a great quarter. I just want to ask a little bit on the margins. I know you've talked about it a little bit today, but it's remarkable to see the profitability you guys are putting up, particularly when competitors are looking at stores and saying, look, the economics are going the other way, and we're going to close a few stores. So as we think about Marmaxx, that was a 14% to 15% margin business at its peak with labor and supply chain stabilizing a bit now and you have -- you have this pricing lever that you didn't really have or flex before COVID or are there any reasons why Marmaxx is in a structurally higher business in the long term, given it's now above 2019 levels? And then I guess as a follow-up, John, you did mention earlier that the long-term 3% to 4% same-store sales growth is flat to 10% -- or sorry, flat to 10 basis point leverage [algo]. But this year is flat to 10 basis points on a 2% to 3% comp, something is a little better this year and then it normalizes next year. And if we get out to the middle of the year and you're running above the 2% to 3% again any reason it wouldn't flow through at a better rate on a point of comp than the 15 basis points that you mentioned?"", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Yes. I mean -- so I'll pick up the last part of your question first. Yes, we had some onetime headwind. So whether it's the incentive accruals or homegoods.com that negatively impacted us last year that helped us to offset what we see as continued wage pressure. So we were able to be at flat to up 10% on a 2% to 3% versus a 3% to 4%. Does that make sense?"", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Yes, it does, yes. In this year, does it -- in this year, is the flow-through still the same though on a point of upside? Or is it also different margin profile on a better...', 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""That's 15 basis points holds true in FY '25 as well for every point of comp opportunity. And then as far as Marmaxx goes, a 13.7% pretax profit. Yes. I mean, obviously, we had a huge improvement during the year, up 100 basis points. And a lot of that has to do with, again, the lower freight rates. Even though freight is not back to where it was in FY '20, we're still 100 basis points off where we were. So we've had to -- through the merchandise margin has been able to offset some of that headwind. And again, we've talked about this in the past, we don't anticipate freight to come back all the way just because of the wage increases that we've seen in particularly domestic freight, whether it's people that work on the rail or in trucks. But we are looking for -- we continue to look for ways to be more efficient on how we move our freight, and that's really where we see the opportunity moving forward. But again, similar to when we talk about HomeGoods, with Marmaxx, it's -- again, it's about that strong execution, driving that top line and continuing to improve the merchandise margin through better buying."", 'Operator', ""And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker."", 'Marni Shapiro', ""Congrats on a fantastic year. And a lot of my questions have been asked. I do want to dig into 1 smaller part of your business. Can we talk a little bit about your credit card business lately as I've been in your stores, I've had some associates asking me if I want a credit card, I'm curious what percentage of your business is done on your own store credit cards? Is there an opportunity there? Is there a data capture that has been helpful to you? Is there an opportunity or a loyalty? Or does that just not really matter because everyone's so addicted, they don't need to actually -- you don't need to do loyalty because it's a physical addiction? Could you just dig into this part of the business a little bit? It's not something you guys usually talk about."", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""Yes. As far as our credit card goes, we don't get into the amount that goes through on our credit card. But I will say this that it's our penetration is not as high as some of the other retailers that offer incentives to use the card, our everyday value is our everyday value, and we don't want to train the customers into waiting on a discount day to use the credit card. So we're highly focused on making sure that the messaging for our -- the model itself is not affected. That being said, the -- it is the one way that customers can get. When they use the credit card, they get coupons back and that drives volume back into our stores. So we definitely see it as a positive for our driving customers back to our stores. And let's face it. It pleases with the customers when they get that coupon, they -- so -- but everybody's read the reports about whether it's delinquencies or the potential for having the late fees reduced that will impact us, but not as much as some of the other retailers that rely much more heavily on the credit card."", 'Marni Shapiro', ""Is there an opportunity to grow that penetration? Is that something you guys would look to do? Because I would think there's probably some level of loyalty and increased visitation with those customers."", 'Ernie L. Herrman', ""So, Marni, just -- we have been growing that penetration over a number of years or so. So as much as -- yes. As much as John pointed out, we're not at what other retailers doing their -- almost their credit card programs, but we are -- their amount higher than we were a handful of years ago. So, yes. Rightfully so. And those shoppers, right, John tend to also cross shop our different brands more and retain more. And so there's a lot of benefits in our sales, and as John said, when they do, it is the only way to get any type of a rebate from us, and it does create that extra visit. So yes, you're right. And we still -- by the way, that's why you get asked in the store. We're trying to still grow that percentage.All right. Well, I think that was our last question. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to updating you again on our first quarter earnings call in May. Thank you, everybody. ."", 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. You may disconnect at this time, and thank you for participating.']"

In addition, the company plans to raise its dividend by 13% in fiscal year 2025.', 'Jefferies Analyst Corey Tarlowe joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into consumer trends within the retail space and what investors should keep in mind when eyeing the sector.', 'Tarlowe: ""It\'s one of our top picks within large cap alongside Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST), the stocks perform very nicely. We do see continued out performance here and the fundamentals that we\'ve continued to observe all throughout 2023 and into 2024 so far have been very, very strong according to the data that we track with traffic, again driving the majority of the top sales gain. We really are very encouraged with what we are seeing alongside the strong sales trends.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""SEANA SMITH: TJX reporting same store sales rising 5% from a year ago in its fourth quarter results. And also saying that it plans to raise its dividend by 13% in fiscal 2025. The better than expected results here, the reason why we're seeing that stock move slightly to the upside ahead of the open is because many of those consumers are trading down to those off price retailer."", ""So let's talk about that landscape with Corey Tarlowe. He's an analyst with Jefferies Corey. It's great to see you here. I'm curious to get your reaction to the numbers that we're getting out here from TJX this morning. And what that tells us about the larger trend that we're seeing play out right now within the retail space."", ""COREY TARLOWE: Sure. Thank you for having me on and good morning. So what I would say is that, number one, the consumer has been largely much more resilient than I think we had expected. There's been relatively low unemployment. There's been relatively strong, spend in categories and channels like off price retail. Specifically in apparel. And the company has seen really great momentum in traffic."", ""So you pointed out what was a 5% same store sales gain. That's predominantly, if not entirely driven by an increase in foot traffic. So at a time when inflation has been up call it 3% to 4%, the sales gains have entirely been driven by new people coming into the store and existing shoppers going to TJ Maxx more often. That's a really great sign for the fundamentals of this business."", 'And the guide was very strong. The company talked about gift being being a highlight in the fourth quarter. And as you mentioned, they also raised the dividend and talked about, I think a 2 to $2.5 billion buyback. So this company generates a lot of revenue. A lot of margin. And a lot of cash flow that they can then return to shareholders.', 'BRAD SMITH: Does that make them then the prime portfolio play for a value conscious consumer or value hacking environment that consumers are currently in right now?', ""COREY TARLOWE: We certainly think so. It's one of our top picks within large cap, alongside Walmart and Costco. And the stock's perform very nicely. So we do see continued outperformance here and the fundamentals that we've continued to observe all throughout 2023 and into 2024 so far. Have been very strong according to the data that we track with traffic again, driving the majority of the Comp sales gains."", ""So we really are very encouraged by what we're seeing alongside the strong sales trends. You've now seen a return to growth and home goods now for the last few quarters. That's helped to unlock a little bit better margin, they've had lower freight expense. Also cited lower shrink and lower promotions. So everything seems to be trending in the right direction for this business at present."", ""BRAD SMITH: Corey, more broadly, when we think about the resilience of the consumer and that narrative that has continued on, how resilient is the consumer, especially if we're looking across the prices that are actually being realized or where there are deep discounts that consumers still continue to look for right now?"", 'COREY TARLOWE: Sure. I think that this is really emblematic. If you take a look at the TJ Maxx results today or if you look at the Walmart results from last week. I think that you continue to see value oriented retailers with attractive price points. That sell not only things that you need. But also things that you want are really trending quite well right now from a sales and a traffic perspective.', ""And you're seeing also some upward margin trajectory too. So that in and of itself tends to be conducive to upward earnings revisions which is a really great reason to buy stocks in retail. So that I think based on the underlying trends that we've seen thus far in the fourth quarter and quarter to date are really emblematic of again a continued upside for Walmart and also TJ Maxx."", ""SEANA SMITH: Corey when it comes to some of those broader trends that we're seeing in terms of where people are spending money. Yes, they are trading down but one of the categories that has remained relatively resilient is the beauty category, is cosmetics, is that something that you think is going to buck that downward trend and remain strong here for the remainder of 2024."", ""COREY TARLOWE: It's a great question and it's certainly a category that TJ Maxx has talked about being quite strong. And in fact, if you go into some of their newer stores-- the newer remodeled stores. What you'll see is a brighter section with new fixtures. You might even see some greater square footage allocated toward the category. And you'll see some new brands as well."", ""So I think that what TJ Maxx and other companies like target with its partnership with Ulta have recognized is that there's a lot of opportunity in this category. It helps to drive trip frequency because it's a consumable type product but it has a non consumable type margin. So it actually helps to benefit profitability.""]"

The company’s Computer & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+29.8% vs. +25.2%). The company’s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving its revenues. It expects net revenues to increase in the low double digits for fiscal 2024.Visa, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing bottom-line growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.The company beat earnings estimates by 3.4% in the fiscal first quarter of 2024. However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia-Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)Amgen’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+24.3% vs. -4.5%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in the future quarters.The addition of Horizon Therapeutics has given Amgen a significant rare disease business. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several data readouts are expected in the next 12 months.However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimates have gone up ahead of Q4 earnings release.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$11b, some 2.6% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$5.13, 34% ahead of expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Public Service Enterprise Group after the latest results."", ' See our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus, from the 13 analysts covering Public Service Enterprise Group, is for revenues of US$10.9b in 2024. This implies a noticeable 3.0% reduction in Public Service Enterprise Group's revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to plunge 28% to US$3.69 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$10.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.69 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$65.53. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Public Service Enterprise Group at US$70.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$61.00. The narrow spread of estimates could suggest that the business' future is relatively easy to value, or thatthe analysts have a strong view on its prospects."", 'Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 3.0% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 2.4% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 4.0% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Public Service Enterprise Group is expected to lag the wider industry.', ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Public Service Enterprise Group.

Good morning to everyone and thanks for joining us to review PSEG’s 2023 fourth quarter and full year results.

Non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $0.54 per share compared to $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP results, excluding the items shown in attachments 8 and 9, which we provided with the earnings release. For the full year of 2023, PSEG reported net income of $5.13 per share compared to $2.06 per share for the full year of 2022. Our non-GAAP operating earnings of $3.48 per share for the full year came in at the high-end of our 2023 guidance range of $3.40 to $3.50 per share and marked the 19th consecutive year that we delivered results meeting or exceeding our guidance.', 'Our fourth quarter 2023 financial results capped off a solid operating year. Building on this results, you can see on Slide 5 that we also reaffirm PSEG’s full year 2024 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.70 per share as well as our 5% to 7% earnings CAGR through 2028 and our $18 billion to $21 billion regulated CapEx plan that supports our rate base CAGR of 6% to 7.5% through 2028. In rolling forward our 5-year capital plan to 2028, we added approximately $3 billion of investments to the prior plan that started from a year end 2023 rate base of $29 billion. These are all unchanged from our January 2024 investor updates and we continue to identify potential investment opportunities for future rate base growth. Dan will discuss our financial results in greater detail following my remarks.', 'So I will focus on a quick look back then on our outlook and objectives for 2024. Since our last earnings call, PSEG has submitted two important filings at the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. In early December 2023, we filed our $3.1 billion Energy Efficiency II investment program. This significantly expanded offering is driven by an increase in work to achieve the savings targets required under the BPU’s updated energy efficiency framework. If approved, this program will launch the state’s second energy efficiency cycle beginning in January of 2025 and run through June of 2027 with investments made over a 6-year period. Our EE2 filing aligns with the annual reduction goals of 0.75% for gas and 2% for electric contained in New Jersey’s Clean Energy Act of 2018, which are all unchanged and extends through the 2027 program year.', 'In the interim, we continue to conduct our award-winning energy efficiency program, which remains oversubscribed. This last November, we filed for a second extension to this program totaling approximately $300 million covering the July through year-end 2024 period. As a direct result of these programs, PSEG is also advancing its Clean Energy Jobs program with a focus on lower and middle-income community hiring and training. Our EE programs continue to create value by lowering customer bills, reducing energy use and emissions and providing shareholders over the return of and on the energy efficiency spending. New Jersey continues to be a national leader in promoting the broad adoption of EE, and it remains an important tool in helping us reach New Jersey’s clean energy goals.', 'The second regulatory filing we made in December was our first distribution base rate case in nearly 6 years. This case addresses 57% of our rate base, given that the other 43% is regulated under FERC Formula Rate. You are aware that this filing was required pursuant to the settlement of our second gas system modernization program back in 2018. The filing proposes an overall revenue increase of 9% and the typical combined residential electric and gas customers seeing a proposed increase of 12%, or less than 2% of compounded growth over the 6-year period. We expect the procedural schedule for this rate case to be issued in near term. And based on previous rate case time lines, we anticipate that this rate case will conclude later in 2024. The largest item in the rate case is to obtain recovery of our capital expenditures, already made to modernize system infrastructure and improve reliability, but not yet in rates as well as to implement recovery of expenditures for the previously approved AMI and electric vehicle programs.', 'Besides capital recovery, the rate case proposes several mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of market volatility on customer bills, including insulating customers from swing in interest rates, severe weather events and revenue-related impacts of pension, providing for a more predictable monthly bill. We are also proposing a new time of use rates that will allow customers to save on their bills by shifting usage to off-peak periods, a rate option that can benefit all customers, including incentivizing residential customers to charge their electric vehicles during these off-peak hours. The BPU has added several commissioners in the past year. Governor Murphy recently appointed Michael Bange, a retired water utility executive with operations experience.', 'The new commissioners continue to advance a full agenda and we already have several data points over the past 6 months that are consistent with prior results, including two recent rate case settlements that adopted the existing New Jersey return on equity rate of 9.6%. These agreements between the BPU staff, Rate Counsel, other interveners and the utilities demonstrate a continued preference for settlements over adjudicated cases in New Jersey. In 2023, the BPU also approved settlements to extend our GSMP II program for 2 years to invest $900 million on infrastructure monetization and greenhouse gas reduction as well as a 9-month extension for $280 million, covering our EE1 program through June of 2024. If you’ve followed us for several years, you know that we are also laser focused on cost containment.', 'In 2023, we were able to lock in 4-year labor agreements with all our New Jersey represented employees, which addresses one of our largest O&M costs. This is just one example of our relentless cost discipline, which has positioned our distribution rate case increases to be the lowest in the state over the 6 years since our last rate case filing back in 2018. A comparison of our in-state electric and gas distribution rate increases since our last rate case is shown on Slide 12. PSE&G’s electric distribution CAGR was less than one-third of the average New Jersey electric CAGR and our gas distribution CAGR was less than half of the average New Jersey gas CAGR. PSE&G’s customer bills continue to compare very well with regional peers for residential electric and gas service and remain lower from a historical share of wallet basis.', 'Of considerable note was our ability to reduce monthly bills for typical net residential natural gas customers with three commodity reductions during 2023 prior to the 2024 heating season. In addition to this focus on affordability, we continue to provide outstanding reliability. For the 22nd consecutive year, PSE&G received a ReliabilityOne award in the Mid-Atlantic metropolitan service area from PA Consulting, an industry benchmarking group. We are very proud this combines our reputation for reliability and our regionally favorable affordability with nationally recognized customer satisfaction scores. PSE&G ranked number one for the second consecutive year in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. electric utility residential customer satisfaction study in the East among our large utilities.', 'We also secured the top position in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. electric utility business customer satisfaction study in that same region. Now, let’s turn to our capital investment programs. During the fourth quarter of 2023, PSE&G invested approximately $1 billion in energy infrastructure and clean energy, bringing the full capital spend to $3.7 billion, our largest ever single year expenditure. As I mentioned earlier, PSE&G finished 2023 with a total rate base of approximately $29 billion, which was a 10% increase over year end 2022 rate base. A key driver of this growth is our energy efficiency program, which continues to experience higher demand for residential and C&I offerings, accounting for close to $480 million of the $3.7 billion. Our infrastructure advancement program, which is focused on modernizing the last mile of our system, has never been more critical as activity in response to new service requests for EV make-ready and additional large specific projects, including data centers picks up.', 'We also installed and placed into service 1.5 million smart meters through our CEF Advanced Metering program or AMI. The total AMI program, which is intended to replace more than 2 million meters in total, is expected to be completed this year, still on schedule and on budget. Now turning to our nuclear operations. The nuclear production tax credit provided in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act began on January 1 of this year and extends through 2032 with a payment of up to $15 a megawatt hour based on nuclear units gross receipts. Our nuclear fleet operated 93% capacity factor for the full year of 2023, producing approximately 32 terawatt hours of carbon-free baseload energy, which included a Salem 1 breaker-to-breaker run between refuelings.', 'In wrapping up, I want to note a few other highlights. For the 16th consecutive year, PSEG has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. And for 2024, PSEG will also be included in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook. U.S. News & World Report also recently named PSEG to its inaugural list of 200 best companies to work for. And in 2023, we were recognized by the CPA-Zicklin Index as a trendsetter for corporate political disclosure practices and accountability. We also completed the sale of our last fossil unit in Hawaii last year, making PSEG Power, one of the few carbon-free baseload generating fleets in the country. This fleet is well situated to benefit from potential data center growth, hydrogen hubs and a license extension with none of the potential upside in our current 5-year plan.', 'PSE&G continues to execute on a robust set of growth investments aligned with New Jersey’s energy policy goals as well as expected growth from increased electrification, including EV adoption, port electrification as well as new business, including data center loads. These last two mentions were recently recognized by PJM in their January 2024 load forecast report for RPS zone. We are very pleased with the progress made thus far to increase the predictability of PSEG, an important part of achieving this comes from our ability to execute on our current 5-year capital investment plan without the need to issue new equity or sell assets. PSEG has delivered on what we said we would do, and I look forward with confidence in this team’s ability to continue to execute on our business plan in the years ahead.', 'I’d like to close my remarks by thanking all 12,500 plus PSEG employees for their dedication and safety, reliability and our customers. I’ll now turn the call over to Dan to discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail and I’ll be available for your questions after his remarks.', 'Dan Cregg: Thank you, Ralph and good morning everyone. As Ralph mentioned earlier, PSEG reported net income of $5.13 per share for the full year of ‘23 compared to net income of $2.06 per share for 2022. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year of 2023 were $3.48 per share compared to $3.47 per share for 2022. For the fourth quarter of 2023, net income was $1.10 per share compared to $1.58 per share in 2022, and non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $0.64 per share in 2022. We’ve provided you with information on Slide 7 and 9 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings per share by business segment for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Slides 8 and 10 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes, the quarter-over-quarter and full year periods and non-GAAP operating earnings per share by major business.', 'Starting with PSE&G, we reported fourth quarter 2023 net income of $0.58 per share compared to $0.70 per share in 2022. The PSE&G had non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.59 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $0.70 per share in 2022. The main drivers for both net income and non-GAAP operating earnings results for the quarter were growth in investments in transmission and gas distribution. These favorable items were offset by the expected decline in pension income and lower OPEB-related credits as well as anticipated higher depreciation, amortization and interest expense resulting from higher investments, not yet reflected in rates and the timing of O&M in the quarter that was within our expectations for the full year. Compared to fourth quarter 2022, margin was $0.03 higher, driven by transmission at $0.01 per share, and gas margin also at $0.01 per share higher, primarily driven by the clause recovery of our GSMP investment.', 'Other utility margin was also $0.01 per share favorable. Distribution O&M expense increased $0.05 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting seasonality and operational timing. But for the full year, distribution O&M was flat versus 2022. Depreciation and interest expense each increased $0.02 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting continued growth in investment. Lower pension income resulting from 2022’s investment returns, combined with lower OPEB credits, which ended in 2023, resulting in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison to the year earlier quarter. Lastly, the timing of taxes recorded through an effective tax rate, which nets to zero across the full year and other flow-through taxes had a net unfavorable impact of $0.01 per share in the quarter compared to 2022.', 'Weather during the fourth quarter, as measured by heating degree days, was 15% warmer than normal and 13% warmer than the fourth quarter of last year. As we’ve mentioned, the Conservation Incentive Program, or SIP mechanism limits the impact of weather and other sales variances positive or negative on electric and gas margins while helping PSE&G broadly promote the adoption of its energy efficiency programs. Growth in the number of electric and gas customers, the driver for margin under the SIP mechanism has remained positive with each up by about 1% in 2023. On capital spending, as Ralph mentioned, PSE&G invested approximately $1 billion during the fourth quarter and completed its largest single year investment program at $3.7 billion for the full year.', 'The program included upgrades and replacements to our T&D facilities, Energy Strong II investments, last mile spend in the infrastructure advancement program, ongoing gas infrastructure replacements via base and GSMP II spending, continued rollout of the clean energy investments in energy efficiency, smart meter installation and EV make-ready infrastructure. We recently rolled forward our 5-year regulated capital investment plan to 2028, amounting to $18 billion to $21 billion, which incorporates both the new $3.1 billion CEF-EE II filing as well as the $300 million expansion of the existing EE program through the end of 2024. For 2024, our regulated capital investment plan totals approximately $3.4 billion. Moving on to PCG Power and Other.', 'For the fourth quarter of 2023, PCG Power & Other reported net income of $0.52 per share compared to net income of $0.88 per share for 2022. Non-GAAP operating loss was $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $0.06 per share for 2022. For the fourth quarter of 2023, net energy margin rose by $0.05 per share after including lower capacity revenues that were $0.03 per share unfavorable and gas offset were lower by $0.01 per share compared to the year earlier quarter. O&M comparisons in the fourth quarter improved by $0.01 per share, driven by the absence of a Hope Creek refueling outage. Lower interest expense was $0.01 per share favorable, primarily the result of lower collateral requirements. Lower pension income from ‘22 investment returns and OPEB credits from the lower amortization benefit were $0.03 per share unfavorable versus fourth quarter of 2022.', 'And taxes and other were $0.03 per share unfavorable compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a partial reversal of the effective tax rate benefit from the first quarter of 2023. On the operating side, the nuclear fleet produced approximately 7.3 terawatt hours during the fourth quarter and 32 terawatt hours for the full year of 2023, running at a capacity factor of 86% and 93% for the quarter and full year, respectively. At year-end 2023, PCG Power had hedged approximately 90% to 95% of its expected generation for 2024 and at an average price of $38 per megawatt hour, up from $31 per megawatt hour in 2023. Touching on some recent financing activity. As of December 31, PSEG had total available liquidity of $3.4 billion, including $54 million of cash on hand.', 'PCG Power had net cash collateral postings of approximately $113 million at December 31, more consistent with historical experience and substantially below the elevated levels seen during 2022. This reduction in collateral also helped to bolster PSEG’s cash from operations to $3.8 billion for the full year 2023 versus $1.5 billion for the full year of 2022. At year-end 2023, PSEG had $500 million outstanding of a 364-day variable rate term loan maturing in April 2024 and PCG Power had $1.25 billion outstanding of a variable rate term loan maturing in March of 2025. We’ve swapped a total of $1.4 billion from these two term loans at PSEG Power and PSEG from a variable to a fixed rate to mitigate variability in interest rates. As of December 31, reflecting our swaps, approximately 4% of our total debt was at a variable rate, which is down nearly 8% since year-end 2022, driven by a reduction in parent short-term debt of nearly $1.7 billion.', 'We continue to maintain solid investment-grade ratings. Looking ahead, we expect that PSE&G’s considerable cash generation combined with PCG Power’s enhanced cash flow visibility from the nuclear PTC will support the execution of PSEG’s 5-year capital spending plan, which is dominated by regulated CapEx without the need to issue new equity or sell assets. In closing, we executed on our 19th year in a row of meeting or exceeding our non-GAAP operating earnings guidance. We are reaffirming PSEG’s full year 2024 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.70 per share, and we are reaffirming the extension of our 5% to 7% operating earnings compounded annual growth rate through 2028. That concludes our formal remarks and we are now ready to begin the question-and-answer session.', 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

As of Dec 29, 2023, L3Harris had a total cash and cash equivalents of $560 million. For 2023, the company had cash inflow from operating activities worth $2.10 billion.It is imperative to mention that meaningful returns from a company’s investments allow it to duly reward its shareholders. To this end, L3Harris plans to continue to make systematic investments to generate strong cash flows in the long run. The company projects capital expenditure to be around 2% of its revenues.During 2023, L3Harris completed two acquisitions — Tactical Data Links and Aerojet Rocketdyne. This will help the company strengthen its national security portfolio and add a considerable long-cycle backlog. Positive synergies from these acquisitions are expected to boost LHX’s future operating results, thereby enabling the company to reward its shareholders with regular dividend hikes.The company expects a target payout in the range of 35-40% of free cash flow. This reinforces its financial prowess through strong earnings and its ability for enhanced dividend disbursements.', 'LHX is not the only one in the aerospace-defense space that has a consistent dividend payment history.

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Larry Coben, NRG's Chair and Interim President and CEO."", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm Larry Coben, and I am the Chairman, Interim President and CEO. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer. And we also have members of the management team on the call and available for questions. While I have been CEO for 3 months, I have been Chairman for 7 and on the board for 20 years. I have never been more excited about NRG as a company than I am today. Let's begin with the NRG value proposition on Slide 4. We are the trusted partner to almost 8 million residential customers earned every day through unique and differentiated offerings and simplify and improve our customers' lives. We have 5.9 million Energy and 2 million Smart Home customers and manage the second-largest C&I energy and natural gas retail portfolio in the country. We have taken the necessary steps to position NRG to win the energy transition. At the convergence of energy and technology in the home and grid with the evolution of smart devices and generative AI data centers. We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs resulting in financial flexibility to return significant capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our business and financial outlook has never been stronger, and I've never been more excited about the future of the company than I am today. Turning to Slide 5. First, in 2023, we delivered record-free cash flow before growth and new record adjusted EBITDA. We exceeded our Investor Day outlook and our previously increased 2023 guidance ranges. This is the direct result of the strategic initiatives and actions we've taken in recent years to strengthen and stabilize our business. Our outlook continues to get better and better, and today, we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges. Next, we made significant progress advancing our long-term energy transition and electrification strategy. We have line of sight to achieving our current $550 million by 2025, and we are now turning our attention to the next phase of our growth. Lastly, we continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy which bring about both a strong balance sheet and returning significant capital to you, our shareholders. Turning to Slide 6. We delivered $844 million of adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, 82% higher than the prior year. This brings our full year results to $3.282 billion of adjusted EBITDA, 76% higher than last year, primarily driven by improved operational performance of our integrated energy platform and the addition of our Smart Home business. Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $152 million above our original guidance midpoint and at the high end of our adjusted guidance. While free cash flow before growth came in above the high end of our increased guidance range at $1.92 billion or $185 million above our original guidance midpoint. This resulted in $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share in 2023, well ahead of the $8.50 per share target provided at our June Investor Day. Bruce will provide more detail shortly. But again, this performance is the direct result of our strategic initiatives and actions taken to strengthen and grow our business. And I note that these took place even with share purchases occurring at higher levels than projected on Investor Day. Turning to our 2023 scorecard, we delivered across our strategic priorities. As you know, safety is our top priority, and I'm pleased to share that we achieved top decile safety performance through a year with many distractions, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their focus and dedication and hard work to making this happen as well as to making our financial results happen. Next, we made progress in our continuous improvement goals for cost excellence. We completed the $300 million direct energy synergy program announced earlier in the year and we quickly turned our attention to identify and execute our previously announced next phase of cost initiatives, $250 million by the end of 2025. Turning to growth. Our success in achieving the $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share versus our 850 target was primarily driven by faster execution of our growth plan. We are incredibly pleased with the results of our Smart Home acquisition and believe our current growth plan is just the beginning. We are only starting to scratch the surface. Lastly, on capital allocation, we executed over $1.5 billion in debt paydown and returned another $1.5 billion to shareholders. Turning to Slide 7. We take a look at our 2024 outlook. Today, we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges in our Investor Day 15% to 20% growth strategic road map. We are well positioned across each of our businesses to deliver on our commitments. In consumer energy, we expect the momentum gained in 2023 to continue into 2024, with volume, margins and earnings growing across residential and small commercial as well as commercial and industrial customer segments. This success will be driven by our diverse and efficient marketing and sales engines, our leading care and retention capabilities and our best-in-class innovative digital experience. We are also seizing numerous opportunities as they arise or as we create them. An exciting example is Lubbock, Texas, a market of just over 100,000 customers that opened in early January with 65% of customers having already made their electricity provider choice. So far, we are exceeding expectations for our success in winning customers and look forward to bringing our innovative offerings and experiences to that market. We also continue to see momentum with community choice programs as a way for customers to experience the benefits of electricity competition in markets that don't have favorable political and regulatory sentiment that would allow customers to have the ability to freely choose their electricity providers. Next, our diversified supply strategy manages our retail exposure in multiple scenarios to include events like the extreme summer of 2023 and Winter Storm Heather this past January, while at the same time, handling the mild weather that we have seen most of this winter. Our targeted investments for reliability and flexibility across our fleet led to material improvements in the performance of our generation when we needed it, and we expect to realize continued improvements. We continue to evaluate various ways to enhance our supply strategy. We have 3 brownfield sites ready to go in Texas with dispatch flexibility, and we are considering additional storage options for the portfolio, primarily through longer-term structured transactions rather than outright ownership. And finally, the Smart Home business delivered a strong year, driving impressive top and bottom line growth. Recurring revenue and margin per customer increased through selling more products and services while simultaneously reducing net service cost per customer. We will continue to drive towards the horizontal expansion of our 8 million customers' wallets. Our customer retention is the best in the industry with an average customer life in the Smart Home business of 9 years driven by unmatched customer engagement and world-class product performance and reliability. We continue to focus on integrating Smart Home and Energy in achieving the initiatives we have previously communicated to you. Turning to Slide 8 for a closer look at growth and cost initiatives. In 2023, we advanced our energy transition electrification and continuous improvement strategy and delivered $138 million of incremental earnings, which was more times than twice our original $65 million target. We exceeded our goals for both growth and cost savings, resulting in more than $100 million of growth in our core businesses and sales channel optimization and more than $35 million in cost savings. This outperformance was primarily the result of realizing synergies faster than originally anticipated. And today, we are reaffirming the full planned target of $550 million of growth in cost initiatives by the end of 2025. Outside of this $550 million program, we have also identified additional attractive initiatives that are in early development leveraging the significant value creation opportunity from the convergence of energy and technology in the home and the grid. First is, for example, virtual power plant or VPP where we are uniquely positioned given our customer scale and reach, our data science proficiency and decades of commercial market -- commercial and market experience. Importantly, VPP will increase in value as the grid tightens, and our integrated energy business will allow us to monetize this value without requiring regulatory change. Second, on data centers and AI. Today, we are one of the largest competitive providers of power to the hyperscalers and other data center managers and we have been in direct conversations with several of these customers about using more load. We see this as a significant opportunity for NRG and for competitive markets more broadly. Finally, we continue to evaluate strategic dispatchable new build with 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield projects in Texas ready to go. As you may know, in November, Texas voters approved the Texas Energy Fund, which provides support for new dispatchable generation. We expect the rules for that to be adopted early this year with applications beginning midyear. We anticipate providing an update on these projects over the coming months. With that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Chung, for a financial review."", 'Bruce Chung', ""Thank you, Larry. Moving to Slide 10. For 2023, NRG produced adjusted EBITDA of $3.282 billion, exceeding our original guidance and at the high end of our upward revised guidance range and free cash flow before growth of $1.925 billion, exceeding the high end of our upward revised guidance range. Our 2023 free cash flow before growth and adjusted EBITDA represents the highest and second highest, respectively, in NRG's history. This strong financial performance is a direct result of excellent execution across our businesses and made possible by the continued focus and effort from each of our employees in a year full of potential distractions. Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA improved by $1.4 billion as compared to 2022, driven by strong performance in our Texas region, the addition of the Vivint Smart Home business, and execution of our growth and cost efficiency plans. Taking a closer look at the drivers within our segments and beginning with Texas, our full year adjusted EBITDA increased by $806 million over 2022. This was driven by higher revenue rates coupled with lower supply costs. Our diversified supply strategy worked as designed throughout a volatile year lowering our supply costs during the mild start to the year and providing stable pricing through the summer's extreme heat. As we discussed throughout 2023, the margin expansion we saw across both our residential and C&I energy businesses, was produced through a combination of careful revenue rate management and providing our customers with differentiated products that address their needs for affordability, comfort and peace of mind. We believe this margin expansion will be durable over the foreseeable future, and this view is reflected in our 2024 guidance. In addition to improved margins, our residential energy business delivered strong customer retention of nearly 80% while maintaining average customer tenure of 6 years. This is a testament to the strength of our brands and customer experience. Our East/West services segments were lower by $142 million versus the prior year. This was due to $60 million from asset retirements and sales with the remainder of the variance from the combination of lower average realized pricing at the Cottonwood facility as well as a challenging housing market and more conservative consumer discretionary spending impacting our HVAC and Goal Zero services businesses. Finally, the addition of Smart Home contributed $753 million in adjusted EBITDA, finishing above the high end of our upward revised guidance for this segment. Throughout 2023, Smart Home delivered across all of its key metrics, most notably, Smart Home achieved 6% ending subscriber growth in an otherwise challenging macro environment. In addition to improving monthly recurring service margins of 9% through increasing average monthly revenue per subscriber, coupled with a continued focus on cost efficiency. Turning to free cash flow before growth. NRG achieved $1.925 billion in 2023, setting a new record for the company. This represents an improvement of $1.4 billion over the prior year, primarily driven by our stronger EBITDA performance, along with improved working capital initiatives across our businesses. At our Investor Day in June, we communicated the 2023 target of $8.50 of free cash flow before growth per share. Our strong performance in 2023 resulted in $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share, even after repurchasing shares at a 25% premium to what we had originally assumed in our Investor Day plan. Our platform is designed to generate significant cash flow. And based on that $9.25 per share and our current share price, that represents an implied free cash flow yield of 18%. Given this dislocation, repurchasing our shares remains one of the best investments we can make, and as such, we remain firmly committed to staying on the course with our capital allocation framework. Throughout 2023, we have demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our strategy and coupled with the compelling long-term macro tailwinds from the increasing electrification of the economy and convergence of energy with smart technologies, we are confident in the outlook for our share price. Turning to the next slide. I'd like to provide some additional context for 2023's financial results. On the left side of the page, we highlight the resiliency of our core Energy business. Our Texas fleet performed well through the second hottest summer in Texas history and most recently continued to perform through the volatility experienced during January's Winter Storm Heather. Over the last few years, we have strategically invested capital and improving the reliability of our facilities in anticipation of volatility across both summer and winter conditions, and we are seeing the impact of those investments through material improvements in our in the money availability factor. This is a performance measure illustrating the availability of our generation assets during periods when we need them the most. As you can see in the bar chart, we realized a 14% and 13% improvement in summer and winter, respectively, in this metric. Furthermore, we saw a nearly 20% improvement in this metric when comparing the fleet's performance during Winter Storm Heather versus Winter Storm Elliott. This level of improvement was and will be critical to ensuring we are able to serve our retail load cost effectively. Moving to the right side of the page. Our Smart Home business surpassed the original expectations, primarily driven by expanded monthly recurring service margins. Notably, the margin expansion was a function of both higher average revenue per subscriber, coupled with lower cost to serve. We are also seeing higher take rates on Smart Home products and services at the point of sale, which is a testament to the effectiveness of our Smart Home sales channels and Smart Home customers recognizing the benefit of increasing the intelligence of their homes through additional seamlessly integrated devices. Turning to Slide 12 for an updated view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see from the slide, not much has changed since our third quarter earnings call where we provided our initial view on 2024 capital allocation. We are still planning on $500 million of debt pay down in 2024 and expect to return nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common dividends. Coupled with the 2023 share repurchase program, we will have executed nearly 75% of the current $2.7 billion authorization by the end of 2024. We expect the 2023 accelerated share repurchase program to conclude by the end of Q1 this year, at which point, we will begin executing our 2024 repurchase plan on a more regular and programmatic basis throughout the year. As I mentioned earlier, at an implied yield of 18%, we see our shares as an excellent investment for shareholder capital, and as such, remain committed to the 80/20 principle we rolled out during Investor Day. In terms of incremental changes since our last earnings call and moving from left to right, 2024 excess cash increased $74 million because of the overperformance in 2023. Other investments increased $33 million, primarily from a calendar year shift in integration costs and capital deployed to small book acquisitions in our residential retail business. Finally, we have $41 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024, which we will evaluate the use of as we move along the year. Before I hand it back to Larry, I'd like to point out that we included some new slides in the appendix of today's presentation, which provide more disclosure around our Energy business. We believe this disclosure will enable investors to model our energy business with a level of granularity they did not have before. These slides will be updated with each earnings call we have going forward. We hope you find them helpful, and our Investor Relations team is more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the new disclosures. With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry."", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Thank you, Bruce. On Slide 14, I want to provide a few closing thoughts about 2024, our priorities and our expectations. We are laser-focused on delivering on our financial and operational commitments and adhering to our capital allocation principles. We will continue to integrate Smart Home with our Energy businesses and deliver on our growth and cost initiatives, all while advancing our energy transition and electrification strategy. I have never been more excited about the future of NRG. We are seeing signs of step-change improvement in fundamentals across our platform including the convergence of energy and technology in the home and grid through smart devices and generative AI. We believe this will put a spotlight on the scarcity of the critical products and services we sell and the durability of our platform. Said bluntly, I believe this step change will signify a change in the depressed valuations for NRG in our sector that have resulted in 20% plus cash flow yields. This will be good for NRG and the sector and it's very exciting times. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. With that, thank you for your time and your interest in NRG. We're now ready to open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.', 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""Look, I know you said it somewhat explicitly in the comments, but I wanted to come back to this. Obviously, with the shares materially higher here. How are you thinking about where you're positioned relative to the 15% to 20% FCF per share target through the forecast period? I just wanted to kind of tackle that. Obviously, doing very well against those targets here out of the gate in year 1. I just wanted to elaborate on that. And then secondly, I just wanted to come back to '24 here. Start of the year looks like probably robust load. How do you think about that positioning you and as you think about reflecting that within what you have out there on targets just in terms of the colder weather in Texas, specifically?"", 'Bruce Chung', ""Sure. Julien, it's Bruce here. So with respect to the 15% to 20%, we still are committed to achieving that 15% to 20% growth in free cash flow before growth per share. We believe that we're increasing both the free cash flow and the EBITDA, as you know, if you look at the '24 number, that's about $150 million above what we had already kind of indicated as part of the Investor Day plan. So we are seeing drivers both on the -- in the numerator. And then obviously, we remain committed to the capital allocation plan. And so we're going to also be driving the denominator. So we still remain committed to that 15% to 20%. With respect to the other question, as we think about 2024, we're basically positioned in the same way as we were in 2023. And so that gives us a lot of comfort in terms of being able to handle what may be on -- what may be coming for us from a load perspective, Winter Storm Heather, we performed very well. The fleet performed very well, and so we're pretty confident about where we stand at this stage."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""Wonderful. Excellent. And if I could just take a little bit on the comments from the -- you provided a second ago. You talked about longer-term storage contract opportunities. This would presumably be an offtake arrangement, which you're an offtaker to some sort of battery investment that someone else makes. If I'm hearing you right, I just want to make sure I understood how you were thinking about batteries and presumably ERCOT here."", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Look, I think that -- yes, that is the answer, but we'll always come back and take a look at the capital that we do have to allocate, but there is an awful lot of people here in Texas who are willing to spend their money and providing storage for us, and that will probably be the optimal use of capital. But as you know, Julien, we always evaluate and reevaluate it as we put our supply strategy together to optimize our capital structure."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""I wanted to ask a bit of a high-level question, and it's obviously building off of Bruce's new disclosure comments and in light of the sort of maybe that step function change in valuation we saw with one of your peers yesterday. Have you given any consideration to maybe transitioning to EPS at some point in the future and providing, maybe, a bit of a longer-range look?"", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', 'Yes.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""All right, we'll leave it at that one."", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', 'The answer, sorry, is yes. Yes. Stay tuned.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""And then perhaps maybe just going back to the CEO search process. I mean, obviously, it's gotten a little bit more competitive recently with sort of on the power and utility head hunting side. Can you just give us some more color on where things stand today in terms of down-selecting. I'm curious if you're now a bit more focused on a power person or a retail consumer person."", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Sure, Shar. I won't take it personally that you seem to be anxious to get rid of me, but no, look Shar, I don't think -- I think we're still looking for a person who spans the 2 types of things that we're doing, consumer and energy, as we said before. We have a terrific committee that's working exceptionally hard. And as I said to you, we had a huge list of candidates when we started, and they are whittling away at that. I think when we talked 3 months ago, I said 3 to 9 months, and I still would stand by that time frame. So I guess that would be 0 to 6 months from now, if I do the math correctly. And there's a tremendous number of people who are looking at NRG, are excited by the prospects, are excited by the ability to drive valuation given the incredible cash flow yield, given the incredible prospects that we have at the confluence of Energy and Smart Home. And so I'm excited by the people that we're seeing, and I think you will be, too."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.', 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""So just also a big picture question. So I mean if there's one thing that we've learned over the last couple of weeks is that investors increasingly value physical power plants, especially those that don't get a participation medal for just showing up. So I'm just wondering how does that fit in your strategy of being asset-light on the generation side in light of the tightening supply demand fundamentals and power. Again, I understand that there is demand response and other ways to probably fit in, in this new picture. But I'm just wondering, just simplistically speaking, how do you deal with that?"", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Sure. Angie, I'm going to let Rob expand on that, but I've never -- I don't think we're asset-light, we're asset optimal and we'll always be asset optimal and that maybe semantics, but I think they're important semantics. We have 3 brownfield projects that are ready to go, and you'll get some updates on those pretty soon, but that's 1.5 gigawatts of dispatchable capacity, and we have some more potential in the pipeline. Maybe, Rob, you want to expand on that, please?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""Sure. So Angie, look, we're excited by the growing demand for power. Like I think that it's real. We know it's real because we talk to a lot of the growth guys, so it's the hyperscalers and others that you've all heard about. We talk to them a lot. And it's exciting for NRG for a couple of reasons. One, we sit in competitive markets, which is where I believe most of this demand growth is going to be. We're going to see expanded margins on our existing fleet, right? So as the product goes up, we're going to see more earnings off of our generation, and we've spent and invested inside of those plants so that we can capture that. Like, Larry said, we've got the 3 projects that are ready to go. And the other thing to think about, Angie, is we've got 21 plant sites across the country. So if there -- if this growth continues and we see it, it makes economic sense, then there's an opportunity there. But ultimately, these guys are going to turn to partners like NRG. As the market tightens, they're going to look for people who've got the expertise that we have. So it's going to be good for the industry, but it's definitely going to be good for us."", 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""But does that mean that in a sense you're shifting a bit of the growth on the energy side towards C&I customers? Because I remember that historically, that was a very small portion of the business and not -- well, meaningfully lower margins than the rest of the business. So anyway, is there like a different earnings or margin profile for those tech companies versus the traditional C&I load that you used to serve?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""So generally, C&I margins themselves over the last few years have gone up. The difference on the margin -- from a hyperscaler versus a traditional C&I customer, there isn't -- we haven't seen a growth in margin on the hyperscalers. The way that you should probably think about it is if you're going to get a bunch of demand into the system, which we believe is real, that's going to create tightness for all customers. And so C&I customers across the board, not just data center customers, are going to be looking for expertise, which means they're going to turn to the bigger players who can help them manage the risk in a higher price, tighter commodity environment. Does that help?"", 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""Okay. Yes. And then changing topics and your IG aspiration. So I obviously see the metrics or the targeted metrics till the end of '24. Can you tell us if you've had any discussions with credit agencies how they see the business risks besides just hitting the numerical thresholds vis-a-vis the investment-grade ratings?"", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Sure, Angie. So just to clarify, we are not chasing an investment-grade rating. As we've always said, we are making sure that we want to hit the metrics that we believe correspond with an investment-grade rating, but that's not to say that we're necessarily going to be chasing it because ultimately, that is up to the agencies. We talk to the agencies very regularly and they like the path on which we are heading from a credit perspective. It's important to note that when you think about our credit metrics, it's not just debt to EBITDA that the agency is focused on. They obviously also look at cash flow-driven metrics. And so we're kind of triangulating around all of that. Ultimately, whether we get the rating or not, like I said, is not necessarily within our control. But what is within our control is being able to hit those metrics. I'd say, as we sit here today, given as you note where we're going to end up at the end of 2024, we think there's probably some flexibility in 2025, with respect to, what our original deleveraging plans were as part of the Investor Day plan, but more to come on that as we move along in the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.', 'Durgesh Chopra', ""I just wanted to kind of go over the cost improvements and the growth opportunity, the $550 million target that you have through -- by 2025. So obviously, this year, you've kind of hit the ground running, exceeded expectations. Maybe can you sort of help us break that apart, the $100 million in growth opportunities? How much of that is cross-selling versus how much of that is actual margin expansion within your existing services? And then as we think about cost improvements, there's a big step change from $37 million this year to about $100 million. Maybe just walk through the drivers of that?"", 'Bruce Chung', ""Yes, you bet. So in terms of the growth synergies, we feel obviously very good about where we set 1 year into the plan through 2025. You can think about the mix as roughly 50% is actually driven by organic growth in the business units, we had obviously a strong year in the base business. And the other 50%, driven by a combination of cross-sell and think of it as a share of wallet-type initiatives that improved the revenue and margin profile per customer. And so we've had a strong start. We have a very high degree of confidence for the $300 million given we exceeded our initial guidance in year 1. And then as it relates to the cost side of things. The $100 million in cost synergies are really a function of elimination of 2 publicly traded companies, and we also exceeded our year 1 target for the cost side. And we have full line of sight to the $100 million by 2025. In fact, we will probably exceed our 2024 target towards that $100 million. And so as we sit here, we feel good on both ends, Durgesh."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Got it. And then maybe just a 1.5 gigawatt dispatchable generation opportunity. Can you maybe walk us through your thought process here? It sounds like you'll be making decisions in the second half of this year. How do you kind of gauge that versus buying back shares as I'm thinking about the long-term outlook, 2025 and beyond?"", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Look, let me just say, it will not impact 1 iota our capital allocation strategy or the buyback of shares. I want to make that clear again and again and again, and you can put that down as a headline. So very, very clear on that. Strategically, it's really -- we have a supply strategy that Rob has laid out on several occasions and looking at how these plants fit into that supply strategy, both for our existing customers, but also for the customers who are coming online with things like data centers like generative AI and some of the other things we've been talking about that are growth and tightening opportunities. Rob, do you want to add anything?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""So the only thing I would tell you is, recall, we've been working on these for a while. We continue to work today. So we continue to get closer to being able to make final commitments. In March, the rules for Texas come out. And then you can expect people to put their names in for the Texas Energy Fund probably June. I would expect that you guys will hear from us as to what we decide. But like Larry said, we're going to -- our capital allocation plan sticks and it all comes down to the financial opportunities that we see in either building the plants or doing something different. And right now, and as you guys have all seen, those plants have flexibility, which is good for how we manage our portfolio and ultimately good for what the grid needs in Texas."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.', 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Maybe on the Smart Home side of things. Again, strong KPIs in 2023. I was wondering if you could comment on how you're expecting a couple of those like subscriber growth and recurring revenue. How do you see those trending now heading into 2024?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""Yes. Thank you. We feel really good about how we exited the year-end '23. As you mentioned, with 6% subscriber growth, the 11% revenue growth, 17% adjusted EBITDA growth. And really, that's a function of a few things. First is the unit economics of the business are in great shape. If you look at the revenue per customer, the service cost reduction per customer of 21% that really drives an expansion of our service margin. And we expect that increased elevated margin to continue into 2024. As it relates to retention and brand loyalty, we are -- we had amongst our best years ever in terms of retaining our customers with a strong and durable customer relationships. We expect that to continue as well. And then in terms of the subscriber growth, we expect to be in the mid-single digits from a subscriber growth perspective as well. So we feel good about how the business is set up in '24. If you zoom out, we operate in a large, growing and fragmented market. And our products and services have a very high degree of engagement and loyalty relative to peers. And so we think there is a lot of room ahead for us to continue to grow the business."", 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Then I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a bit more on the data center impact to the business. Am I understanding you correctly that as you see load growth from these data centers happen in ERCOT, for example, you could see, I guess, potentially higher pricing, more volatile pricing? And over time, that could lead to higher margins across the board, higher retail margins across customer classes for your business. Is that the right way to think about it?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""It's Rob. Yes. So generative AI is going to load or created additional demand across the markets. The way to think about how that affects the businesses generally is let's start with that expands the margins on our existing generation portfolio and also makes that 1.5 gigawatts more interesting. And then when you think across the other parts of the business, C&I, you're going to see people turning towards bigger players like us, where we've seen it historically, when things get tighter, they run to quality providers, we're there. And then from a home perspective, a consumer perspective, we've had a retail platform that has historically, and will in the future, manage through different commodity cycles. And as prices move, our retail platform, because of the experience we have beyond just being a commodity provider, we do well in those markets, too."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe.', 'Michael P. Sullivan', ""Appreciate the new disclosures on the Energy business, by the way. But I wanted to just go back to Texas and new build there. And just maybe if you could just frame the broader political dynamic there, where things stand just in light of the Lieutenant Governor making some comments, I think, asking for new bill, do you kind of continue to see these headlines noise around the ECRS. I know we're not in a legislative session this year, but just kind of where the politics stand on market structure and the like?"", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""If I could understand Texas politics, I'd be in a different business probably, Michael, there's not a legislative session. I think it's fair to say that people are now looking to see whether everything that was passed in the last session is actually going to generate capacity in the state before people start breaking it up again and starting over. The PUC has a lot -- awful lot of work to do just to implement the many things that were passed in the legislature. And I think a combination of those measures plus the tightening market and the improving economics in the market and the expanding margins will probably generate the capacity that Texas will need to meet growth in the foreseeable future. At least that's our view of what's happening in politics. That doesn't mean that people from time to time won't try to use the energy business as a political football. But on balance, we actually see a fair amount of stability on the legislative front."", 'Michael P. Sullivan', ""Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that's a tough one. And just if you do move forward with these brownfield plants, how long would it take to complete?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', 'So the -- if you recall, the portfolio is 3 different projects, the peakers, we could get in, in 2 years and starting from whenever we broke ground and then a CCGT takes about 4. So you could expect if we were to go soon 2026 and 2028 would kind of be good years to think about from an additional capacity perspective.', 'Michael P. Sullivan', 'Okay. Great. And then just last one quick. You mentioned the new Lubbock market, any like rough sense of size of the opportunity set there? And is any of that baked into your plan? Or is that all upside?', 'Elizabeth Killinger', ""Yes. So this is Elizabeth. Thanks for the question. So we are really excited about the Lubbock opening. 2 things about it. One, 65% of consumers made a choice. And if you have a reference point like when the Texas market opened, 5% made a choice. So demonstrating that consumers actually care who they do business with in Energy. NRG participated in the presale process. That's where the 65% made the choice and those customers will come on flow in March, and that is baked into our 2024 and beyond growth plans. The only other thing I would say is so far, NRG is overperforming, we have about 39% share of customers in Texas on the home front, and we are overperforming relative to that. So again -- and Larry mentioned it, but about 100,000 customers in the marketplace that are making a choice. And so they'll start and be our and other retailer customers in March."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi.', 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""Hoping to touch on retail energy gross margin outlook. It looks like your guidance is assuming about 100 basis points degradation there. How much is that weather normalized for '24? And is there any conservatism embedded in that forecast in light of your comments? Any color you could share around potential upside there, in particular, in Texas?"", 'Bruce Chung', ""So, Ryan, it's Bruce. The 2024 number is certainly on a weather-normalized basis. But the '24 number does reflect a higher assumption on COGS for the retail business. And so there's just a bit of a timing lag between the realization of that COGS relative to when that gets pushed through in revenue rate. But Elizabeth, if you want to provide a little bit more color there?"", 'Elizabeth Killinger', ""Yes. So we've demonstrated margin stability over the years in the home space. And that comes from -- and most of you were there, from some of the AI/Machine Learning revenue management tools and models we created back in the transformation program and since have continuously improved them. The other thing I would highlight is that over this, call it, the last decade, we've been able to deliver stable and growing margins in a variety of supply cost environment. So this one, Bruce mentioned, where costs have significantly increased over the last few years, and we've either grown or held margins through that time frame, aside from the weather normalization that you mentioned."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""How much cost escalation are you assuming for 2024 that's being offset by these other measures?"", 'Bruce Chung', ""Ryan, that's probably one that we'll have to just get back to you on to make sure that we get you the right numbers on that."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now pass it back to Larry Coben for closing remarks."", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today and for your interest in NRG. And I think you can see we are at the most exciting point, probably in NRG's history. I think you can hear in the voices of the management and in our actual results, what we have and are planning to achieve going forward. We look forward to speaking with you more in the days ahead. We'll be at the conferences in New York next week. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to Kevin and Brendan with any further questions that you might have. Thank you all."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.""]"

That puts it on the cusp of achieving the key milestone of a decade. At this point, management seems pretty confident that it will hit that target, projecting annual distribution growth of around 6% through 2026. So why is NextEra Energy Partners' yield 12.7%?"", 'NextEra Energy Partners is a master limited partnership (MLP) controlled by parent NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). NextEra Energy Partners owns a large collection of renewable power assets, many of which it bought from its parent. This is an important relationship, as NextEra Energy Partners is really a funding vehicle for NextEra Energy.', 'NextEra Energy builds clean energy assets and then sells them, in whole or in part, to NextEra Energy Partners. This is often called a dropdown transaction. NextEra Energy Partners funds the purchase via the sale of MLP units and debt. The big reason investors buy NextEra Energy Partners units is the distribution, which has historically grown along with its portfolio of assets.', ""The problem today is that the relationship between these two entities has changed. First, Wall Street has soured on renewable power stocks, putting downward pressure on NextEra Energy Partners' units. Then interest rates rose, making it more expensive to issue debt. All told, NextEra Energy Partners' ability to raise cash for dropdown transactions isn't great today. And that has resulted in parent NextEra Energy hitting the pause button on new dropdowns, effectively halving the growth of the MLP's distribution."", 'So what should an investor do now?', ""If you don't own NextEra Energy Partners, the huge 12.7% yield is clearly the reason to buy it. It would be icing on the cake if the distribution can continue to grow at around 6% a year. And given the relationship with NextEra Energy, one of the largest and fastest-growing utilities in the United States, NextEra Energy Partners has strong support behind it."", ""However, you have to go in with the understanding that NextEra Energy Partners' story has changed for the worse. And it isn't yet clear that the MLP is on a sustainable path. Utilities used the same funding approach in the midstream space not too long ago only to close the MLPs they created when unit-price declines ended the funding usefulness of the MLPs. This is basically what is happening right now with NextEra Energy Partners. That said, there is still a long growth runway ahead for renewable power, so the analogy isn't perfect. To buy NextEra Energy Partners, you need to believe that the outlook for clean energy is still strong."", ""The simple reason to sell NextEra Energy Partners is that the MLP's condition has weakened. If you bought it because of the potential for double-digit distribution growth, you won't be getting that now. This could be a temporary slowdown, or it could be permanent; there's really no way to tell at this point. And, as noted above, NextEra Energy Partners could cease to exist if it no longer provides an attractive funding source for parent NextEra Energy. If NextEra Energy buys the MLP, there might be a slight premium offered to unitholders, but it probably won't be massive. It would be understandable if dividend growth investors wanted to cut their losses and move on to opportunities that seem more attractive."", 'If you have owned NextEra Energy Partners for long enough, you are probably sitting on material capital losses. You could capture those losses to offset gains elsewhere in your portfolio. That, however, is complicated by the MLP structure, which makes use of return of capital distributions (such distributions reduce your cost basis in the MLP over time). You might want to consult a tax advisor if you are thinking about selling for tax reasons.', ""Even if you are sitting on material losses, you're still collecting the distribution. And it would likely be hard for an investor to replace the cash that NextEra Energy generates with the proceeds from selling the units because of the unit-price decline. Unless you believe that the story has changed irreversibly for the worse, sitting tight and giving parent NextEra Energy some time to muddle through the current headwinds wouldn't be the worst decision. It's worth pointing out the lowered distribution growth plan is still fairly attractive. Just realize that you are betting on parent NextEra Energy's ability to execute in a difficult environment. It has a strong history of doing so, but that doesn't mean it will always be able to achieve its targets."", ""Wall Street is clearly telling investors that they should be worried about NextEra Energy Partners' future. Given the shifting dynamics, driven by both the clean energy sector and interest rates, this is a high-risk investment today. With a strong parent, there's reason to believe that NextEra Energy Partners will successfully navigate this difficult period and continue to reward unitholders with big distributions."", ""But the history of MLPs acting as funding sources for utility parents highlights that there is a very real chance NextEra Energy Partners will cease to exist if it stops being useful. If that comes to pass, investors probably won't be left with nothing, but the distribution will go away and likely be replaced by a much lower dividend stream. If you decide to buy or hold NextEra Energy Partners, you will want to monitor it very closely."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy Partners wasn’t one of them.

ACA stand to gain from increased repair and remodeling (R&R) projects, improved residential market, operational excellence, geographic and product diversification strategies, strategic acquisitions, and higher infrastructure investments.', 'Industry Description', 'The Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry primarily comprises manufacturers, designers and distributors of home improvement and building products like ceiling systems, doors, windows, flooring and metal products. Some industry players provide solutions to rehabilitate the aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in the wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries. The companies also manufacture expansion joints and structural bearings, ventilation products, ground-mounted solar racking and commercial greenhouses, as well as mail storage (solutions including mailboxes along with package delivery products).

Meanwhile, as the industry players’ business prospects are highly correlated with U.S. housing market conditions and the R&R activity, solid momentum in the R&R markets and improving residential construction markets are expected to drive growth. Builders are now cautiously optimistic for 2024 as the lack of existing inventory is shifting demand to the new home market, thereby driving the demand for companies’ products in the industry.Operational Excellence, Product Innovation & Acquisitions: The industry participants have been undertaking strong cost-saving initiatives like business consolidation, system implementations, plant/branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions to boost profitability. Industry participants have also been strategically investing in new products, sales and support services, digitally enabled solutions and advanced manufacturing capabilities to boost revenues. The companies are also following a systematic acquisition strategy to supplement organic growth and expand access to additional markets and products.Rising Costs: Inflationary headwinds with respect to transportation costs, material costs and energy costs have been a pressing concern. Also, rising labor costs are compressing margins. These are dampening the companies’ operating performance. Although the industry participants have been working to recover higher costs through various price increases, they expect this ongoing volatility in material and transportation costs to be a concern. Apart from higher raw material costs, the companies bear expenses related to product launches.

Defense companies tend to make the bulk of their profits from big-time procurement deals with government agencies such as the Defense Department in the U.S. and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) in the United Kingdom."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with HII.', 'For instance, last year, President Biden allotted more than $816.7 billion in federal funding for the Defense Department after signing the Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act into law.', 'For the 2024/25 financial year, the UK is projected to spend more than $60 billion in real cash terms on their defense budget, an almost $20 billion increase compared to the 2020/21 financial year. Over in Europe, NATO Allies will be spending 2% of their combined GDP on defense for the first time. Allies will be investing more than $380 billion into defense programs, including the replenishing of their stockpiles.', 'The unfortunate reality is that war makes money, and global superpowers are pumping billions into defense and aerospace companies to help bolster national defense programs and transform legacy strategies with cutting-edge technology.', 'Continuing uncertainty across the Middle East and geopolitical hotspots around the world could help U.S. defense contractors bolster their earnings in the coming months. For investors, this could be a time to load up on aerospace and defense stocks, although the answer to this is not as clear-cut as one might think.', 'For instance, following the initial attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF soared roughly 7%. Back in February 2022, the MSCI World Aerospace and Defense Industry Index and MSCI World Index managed to outperform the market following the invasion of Ukraine by neighboring Russia.', 'Unfortunately, the instability experienced across parts of the Middle East and in Ukraine has been a regularity for many of these funds. Yet, based on historic events that have played a significant role in the performance of aerospace and defense stocks, the consensus remains that near-term political intervention can leave stocks flip-flopping when compared to the broader market.', 'In that case, investors usually look at filling their portfolios with stocks that can provide long-term stability, rather than short-term gains. More than this, aerospace and defense stocks tend to lag behind the general market, and only experience rapid intervals of growth following the outbreak of war or conflict. Working with such a strategy would require investors to consider a mix of diverse defense options that provide them with an assumed outcome further supported by a forward-looking strategy and consider the play between supply and demand.', 'The bereaved reality of current affairs provides investors with an opportunity to consider long-term defense players that could be a complimentary addition to their portfolios. However, for some, the question regarding the political and social climate under which these companies operate only further creates a more moral-like challenge for investors looking to promote ESG-centered investment strategies.', ""With the continued conflict sweeping across parts of the world, here's a rundown of the defense companies that could provide investors with some stability and long-term gain."", 'Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is one of the largest U.S. Department of Defense contractors, and provides global aerospace, defense, and security products and services to a large portfolio of governments, outside of the United States.', 'Commercial partners include Australia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, and the Middle East.

The company claims that organic growth of 20% was the largest contributor, and increasing activity volumes in the Middle East and North America were mostly responsible for the positive organic revenue turnaround.', 'For 2024, PSN shares have already managed to climb by 19.65%, with shares seeing a significant boost of 11% halfway through February. Looking at the longer scale, PSN is more than 60% up from the same time last year, with share prices now above $74.00 per share, compared to $44.47 per share last year this time.', 'Again, Parsons is in that sweet spot where investors would want it to be. The company has reported positive fundamentals, has positive forward-looking guidance, and has closely partnered with several government agencies that will help keep them in business for the next several years, at least.', ""A list of defense stocks isn't complete without Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).

Last year proved to be yet another successful year for the company, reporting more than $67.6 billion in full-year sales, and a total of $18.9 billion in fourth-quarter sales. For the fourth quarter, the company reported more than $2.4 billion in cash from operations, and over $1.7 billion in free cash flow for the same quarter."", 'The company has released its 2024 financial outlook, and most of its guidance is around holding up a free cash flow above $6 billion.

On a quarterly basis, revenues rose 3.2% year over year and were up to $3.2 billion.', 'The positive revenue turnaround was largely due to better-than-expected performance across all business segments, and the total backlog increased to more than $48.1 billion due to more than $12.5 billion in new contracts being awarded throughout last year.', 'Their financial outlook for the year ahead shows the company looking to boost its shipbuilding revenue performance between $8l8 and $9.1 billion, with an operating margin between 7.6% and 7.8%. Elsewhere, mission technologies are also expected to outperform current margins, with the forward guidance set at between $2.7 to $2.75 billion segment operation revenue.', 'As part of its mission statement for the year ahead, the company has told shareholders that various key factors, including labor market challenges, supply chain disruptions, costs relating to pension and healthcare costs, cyber security threats, and other future disruptions are some of their main priorities this year.', ""Tension in the waters around the Middle East could further bolster Hunting Ingal's performance this year, as the U.S. has already started deploying ships to the region following the Israeli-Hamas and now Somali-backed Houthi attacks taking place in the region."", ""Could this fallout bring Huntington new contracts in the near future requires further consideration, however, for investors this brings a long-term strategy that could help them take better advantage of conflict scenarios that could help boost their portfolio's performance."", 'Another year of war and conflict is driving investors to lock in defense stocks in an attempt to tap into new opportunities that can provide them with a long-term strategic ability to outperform weaker markets, and steadily ride on the back of defense companies reeling in billions in government contracts and funding.', 'However, investors are wondering whether all this conflict and tension could actually help bolster company performance on the stock market. Better yet, understanding the long-term need for these companies at a time when more investors are hoping to move towards ESG-focused investments could play in direct opposition to their investment goals.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

However, few strategies have been more successful over the long run than buying and holding dividend stocks.', 'Last year, Hartford Funds released a report that thoroughly examined the ins and outs of dividend stocks over extended periods. In particular, a collaboration with Ned Davis Research found that income stocks averaged a 9.18% annual return over a half-century (1973-2022), with dividend growers and initiators really packing a punch (10.24% annualized return). For comparison, the annualized return of the equal-weighted S&P 500 came in at 7.68%, while the average annual return of non-payers was a mere 3.95% over the same timeline.', ""Hartford Funds' findings shouldn't be all that surprising. Businesses that pay continuous dividends tend to be profitable on a recurring basis and, in many instances, they can provide transparent long-term growth outlooks. In short, they're just the type of companies you'd expect to see grow in value over lengthy periods."", ""However, no two dividend stocks are cut from the same cloth. If investors want truly safe annual income, their best bet is to search among Wall Street's Dividend Kings. A Dividend King is a company that's raised its base annual payout for at least 50 consecutive years. Chances are that if a business has increased its aggregate payout for a half-century or longer, it's a time-tested operating model."", 'If you want $1,000 in ultra-safe annual dividend income, simply invest $19,000 (split equally, three ways) into the following three time-tested Dividend Kings, which sport an S&P 500-trouncing average yield of 5.26%.', ""The first Dividend King that can provide exceptionally safe and consistent income from a starting investment of $19,000 that's split across three stocks is none other than healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). J&J, as the company is more commonly known, has raised its base annual payout in each of the past 61 years."", 'Investors might note that J&J has failed to keep pace with the rising stock market over the past 14 months. This is primarily due to uncertainty over litigation concerning its now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder, which is alleged to have caused cancer in some users. Johnson & Johnson has attempted to settle these lawsuits, which number up to 100,000, on two occasions, but ultimately had its settlement proposals tossed in court.', ""While the above might sound like a dealbreaker to some investors, let me assure you that Johnson & Johnson is about as rock-solid of a company as they come. It's one of only two publicly traded companies to have received the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of S&P Global. J&J has nearly $23 billion in cash on its balance sheet and generated over $22 billion in operating cash flow in 2023. It won't have any trouble paying a settlement."", ""Additionally, J&J brings cash-flow predictability to the table. We don't get to decide when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop. Regardless of what's happening with the stock market or U.S./global economy, demand for prescription drugs, medical devices, and healthcare services remains steady."", ""Speaking of steady, one of Johnson & Johnson's greatest strengths has been the continuity of key leaders. You only need two hands to count the number of CEOs the company has had since its founding in 1886. Avoiding a carousel at the top has ensured that J&J's growth initiatives have remained on track."", ""Decisively shifting its focus to novel pharmaceuticals more than a decade ago has also played a key role in J&J's steady adjusted operating earnings growth. Even though brand-name drugs have finite periods of sales exclusivity, they offer superior pricing power and margins. J&J hasn't been shy about investing in novel research and collaborations to keep its pharmaceutical growth engine humming along."", ""A second Dividend King that can be responsible for producing $1,000 in ultra-safe annual dividend income from a beginning investment of $19,000 that's split three ways is tobacco giant Altria Group (NYSE: MO). Altria has raised its payout 58 times over the past 54 years, is currently yielding almost 10%, and intends to keep its payout ratio around 80%."", ""There's no sugarcoating that tobacco companies are contending with a changing landscape. Consumers have become increasingly aware of the potential long-term dangers of tobacco use, which has sent adult cigarette smoking rates in the U.S. plunging from 42% in 1965 to just 11.5%, as of 2021. The good news for the U.S.-focused Altria is that it has a couple of catalysts in its corner that can still move the needle."", ""As I've pointed out a number of times before, Altria's clearest advantage is its pricing power. Tobacco contains nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. The lure to continue using tobacco products allows Altria to raise its prices with minimal customer pushback. Price hikes help it to somewhat or fully offset declines in cigarette shipments."", ""It also doesn't hurt that Altria has the most desirable products within the tobacco space. Specifically, premium brand Marlboro gobbled up a 42.1% share of the U.S. cigarette market in 2023, with Altria's entire portfolio accounting for a nearly 47% share of the domestic cigarette industry. When you're the top dog, it makes raising prices even easier."", 'However, the way Altria is going to put concerns about a shrinking percentage of smokers in the rearview mirror is by adjusting its growth strategy. It took a big step forward this past June when it closed on a $2.75 billion buyout of electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings.', ""To be fair, Altria flubbed badly with its sizable investment in e-vapor company Juul. But there's good reason to believe it's not making the same mistake twice with NJOY. That's because NJOY has received six marketing granted orders (MGOs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. MGOs effectively grant permission for e-vapor products to be sold. Since most e-vapor products on retail shelves lack MGOs and could, in theory, be pulled at any time, Altria's smokeless segment looks to be in phenomenal position to deliver sustained growth."", 'The third time-tested Dividend King that can help you bring home $1,000 in ultra-safe annual dividend income from an initial $19,000 investment split among three stocks is consumer staples company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). The company increased its quarterly distribution for the 62nd straight year two weeks ago.', ""The biggest headwind for Coca-Cola tends to be inflation. If the cost for ingredients and/or labor rises too quickly, or consumers have their discretionary spending constrained by the rising price of goods and services, it could threaten to reduce Coca-Cola's margins or perhaps encourage consumers to trade down to cheaper store-branded beverages. But let's face the facts: Coke wouldn't have made this list if it didn't have clearly identifiable competitive advantages working in its favor."", 'For starters, consumer staples stocks usually provide predictable operating cash flow. Although shoppers might pare back their spending on discretionary items during periods of uncertainty, beverages are a necessity in any economic climate. Coca-Cola has the distinction of being the most chosen brand from retail shelves for 10 consecutive years, according to Kantar\'s annual ""Brand Footprint"" report (as of 2022).', 'On top of being one of the most recognized and valuable consumer goods brands globally, Coca-Cola also offers virtually unsurpassed geographic diversity. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has operations ongoing in every country. This allows it to take advantage of higher organic growth rates in emerging markets, while still generating predictable cash flow in developed countries.', 'Another competitive advantage for Coca-Cola is its undeniable ability to engage with consumers. The company has devoted a sizable percentage of its marketing budget to digital ads and is relying on artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor messages for younger audiences. Meanwhile, it can lean on well-known brand ambassadors as a way to connect with its more mature consumers. Few consumer goods brands can cross generational gaps with ease and connect with people quite like Coca-Cola.', 'Lastly, Coca-Cola has historically enjoyed exceptionally strong pricing power. Though inflation does pose a risk, most consumers have been willing to absorb price increases and have stuck by the Coca-Cola brand.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Johnson & Johnson wasn’t one of them.

Miller, co-founder of Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE: CCI) (""Crown Castle"" or the ""Company"") and his investment vehicle Boots Capital Management, LLC (""Boots Capital"") today filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the ""Court"") seeking to invalidate the cooperation agreement between Crown Castle\'s Board of Directors (the ""Board"") and Elliott Investment Management, L.P. (together with its affiliates, ""Elliott"") announced on December 20, 2023. Under the terms of the cooperation agreement, Elliott and the Company appointed two new directors, Jason\xa0Genrich, Partner at Elliott, and Sunit Patel, Chief Financial Officer of Ibotta Inc. (collectively, the ""Elliott Directors""), to the Board. Elliott received substantial governance rights without the customary provision that it be required to maintain an equity ownership position in the Company.1', 'Mr. Miller stated: ""The Crown Castle Board\'s short-sighted decision to enter into this fundamentally unlawful cooperation agreement just prior to the Company\'s nomination window is yet another example of the Board\'s poor governance, lack of accountability, hostility towards its shareholders, and track record of flawed decision making, all of which have resulted in the destruction of tens of billions of dollars in shareholder value. Moreover, the terms of the cooperation agreement granted Elliott certain governance rights without requiring it to maintain an equity ownership position in the Company, grossly misaligning Elliott\'s short-term profit incentives with the long-term interests of Crown Castle and its shareholders. Submitting the cooperation agreement to a shareholder vote is a necessary step to help restore the Company\'s credibility with investors and forestall costly and distracting litigation, which could delay a sale of the Company\'s fiber assets and further erode shareholder value.\xa0 However, given the Board\'s continued refusal to put the unlawful cooperation agreement to a shareholder vote, we have filed this lawsuit to defend the rights of Crown Castle\'s shareholders.""', 'The complaint alleges the following:', ""The cooperation agreement directly infringes upon the Board's powers and responsibilities, and substantially restrains the Board's ability to use its own best judgment on key management matters in violation of Section 141 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and confers outsized concessions upon Elliott, including a commitment to include the Elliott Directors on the Board's slate in the 2024 election and guaranteed Elliott representation on key Board committees."", ""The terms of the cooperation agreement are invalid and unenforceable as a matter of Delaware law, as reflected most recently in the February 22, 2024 written opinion by Vice Chancellor Travis Laster, in the case West Palm Beach Firefighters' Pension Fund v. Moelis & Company.2"", ""The Company breached its own bylaws through its entry into the cooperation agreement, which impermissibly constrains the Board's authority on key governance matters in direct violation of certain of its bylaw provisions, a matter further reaffirmed in the recent Laster opinion in the Chancery Court."", ""Elliott and the Elliott Directors knowingly aided and abetted the director defendants' breaches of fiduciary duty outlined in the complaint and provided them with substantial assistance."", 'Mr. Miller added, ""It is unconscionable that the Company\'s current Board has just seven total years of tower industry operating experience, even after the recent addition of new directors. To that end, we believe Crown Castle\'s Board must be reconstituted with directors that have the necessary industry expertise and\xa0skillsets to execute a long-term strategy that will enhance operational excellence, fix the Company\'s broken culture, and restore and unlock meaningful value for long-suffering shareholders.""', ""On February 20, 2024, Mr. Miller nominated a slate of four highly qualified director candidates who collectively would bring more than five decades of successful global tower industry experience to the Crown Castle Board. Mr. Miller and the nominees have presented a detailed and actionable plan to the Board to optimize the value of Crown Castle's fiber assets, digitize its tower portfolio, materially improve its operations and go-to-market strategy, rebuild its management team with experienced executives, repair its broken company culture, and deliver significantly improved financials to restore and drive shareholder value. In addition to this detailed operating plan, Mr. Miller and the nominees have led and shared with the Company a six-month due diligence process with 25 prospective buyers and financing sources to increase the speed and certainty of completing a sale of Crown Castle's fiber assets this year, before potential tax benefits of over $1 billion expire at the end of 2024."", 'Heyman Enerio Gattuso & Hirzel LLP and Woolery & Co.

The term was coined with the intention of offering recommendations to the financial sector on how to effectively incorporate environmental, social, and governance factors into investment decisions, recognizing their potential to significantly influence the value of investments.', ""Climate change remains a top priority for the majority of countries, investors, and international organizations. With the approach of 2050 and the increasing emphasis on globally agreed 'net-zero' commitments, addressing climate issues will become even more crucial. This agenda item is expected to gain significance, not only driven by public markets but also by the private sector. The significant focus on addressing climate issues has led to a notable increase in ESG-focused investments in recent times. According to a widely cited survey conducted by Morgan Stanley, over half of individual investors, approximately 54%, intend to boost their sustainable investments in 2024. Additionally, the survey indicated that more than three-quarters of individuals, around 77%, express interest in sustainable investing. The report provided the following observation regarding the trend in ESG investments over the years:"", '“Even investors who know or assume that their sustainable investments underperformed their traditional investments in 2022 report growing interest in sustainable investing. This suggests that sustainability-focused investors tend to be more focused on long-term investment horizons and may not be deeply concerned by short-term fluctuations.”', ""However, investors lacked confidence in their ESG-focused investments in 2023, withdrawing a total of $5 billion from these funds in the fourth quarter, which contributed to a yearly outflow of $13 billion. This decline was attributed to poor performance, ongoing political scrutiny in the US, and challenges faced by an iShares fund, according to a report by Morningstar. While the outflows may seem concerning at the moment, they don't necessarily paint a grim picture of ESG investing overall. Despite these outflows and the fact that sustainable equity funds often trailed behind conventional peers in terms of returns for 2023, market appreciation helped bolster sustainable fund assets by the end of the year. The total assets in sustainable funds reached $323 billion by the close of 2023. This figure reflects a decrease of nearly 12% from the peak recorded at the end of 2021, but it marks an increase of 18% from the recent low point observed in the third quarter of 2022."", ""One prime example illustrating unwavering confidence in ESG investing can be seen through BlackRock's steadfast commitment to sustainable investment practices.

Data from Morningstar Direct reveals that BlackRock's assets under management linked to ESG surged by 53% from the beginning of 2022 to the end of the previous year.

As you may recall, back in May, short-seller Hindenburg Research issued a “short report” on Icahn’s publicly-traded investing vehicle, Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP).', 'This report led to a sharp decline in price for IEP shares, and ultimately resulted in the master limited partnership cutting its dividend by 50%.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'But while down billions following IEP’s big plunge, even at 88 years old Icahn is not quite yet out of the game just yet.

Although the investor has yet to acquire a position in the utility holding company large enough to require disclosure via a13D filing with the SEC (5% or higher), Icahn has already made major progress gaining influence on AEP’s board.', 'As announced on Feb. 12, American Electric Power has added two Icahn-affiliated directors to its board. While it appears Icahn is taking a more behind-the-scenes and collaborative approach with AEP stock, it could prove profitable to ride his coattails on this particular name.', 'A more aggressive push for efforts like cost reductions and divestitures, coupled with a potentially more favorable macro environment (utility stocks are very sensitive to interest rates), could lead to solid gains for AEP, which also sports a 4.35% forward dividend yield.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/Romix Image', 'Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) became one of the Carl Icahn stocks in early 2023. That’s when the activist investor first began accumulating a position, after shares in the gene sequencing products provider lost nearly two-thirds of their value, due to the company’s ill-fated acquisition of cancer detection company Grail.', 'Since building up a stake in ILMN stock, Icahn has gained a board seat, and the company now has a new CEO, but the activist is not done yet shaking things up. Icahn has taken the incumbent board to court, for alleged breach of fiduciary duty. He is also pushing for the removal of two legacy directors.', 'Boardroom drama notwithstanding, it remains to be seen whether Icahn’s efforts will lead to gains for Illumina shareholders.

Not too long after announcing his position, JetBlue announced that it was adding two Icahn nominees to its board. JBLU stock initially surged on the Icahn news yet has since pulled back. Perhaps, the market is remembering the activist’s last major move on an airline stock: TWA.', 'Yes, it’s premature to compare Icahn’s JetBlue investment with his controversial involvement with TWA. Still, it does highlight the challenges of activist investing in airlines. A profitable exit strategy for Icahn may also prove challenging.

The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Cigna Group's shares on or after the 5th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.40 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.60 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Cigna Group stock has a trailing yield of around 1.7% on the current share price of US$335.13. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Cigna Group ', 'Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Cigna Group paid out a comfortable 28% of its profit last year.', ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, Cigna Group's earnings per share have been growing at 11% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Cigna Group has delivered 64% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see."", 'From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Cigna Group? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Cigna Group more closely.', 'With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Cigna Group and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.', ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Over in Europe, NATO Allies will be spending 2% of their combined GDP on defense for the first time. Allies will be investing more than $380 billion into defense programs, including the replenishing of their stockpiles.', 'The unfortunate reality is that war makes money, and global superpowers are pumping billions into defense and aerospace companies to help bolster national defense programs and transform legacy strategies with cutting-edge technology.', 'Continuing uncertainty across the Middle East and geopolitical hotspots around the world could help U.S. defense contractors bolster their earnings in the coming months.

Back in February 2022, the MSCI World Aerospace and Defense Industry Index and MSCI World Index managed to outperform the market following the invasion of Ukraine by neighboring Russia.', 'Unfortunately, the instability experienced across parts of the Middle East and in Ukraine has been a regularity for many of these funds. Yet, based on historic events that have played a significant role in the performance of aerospace and defense stocks, the consensus remains that near-term political intervention can leave stocks flip-flopping when compared to the broader market.', 'In that case, investors usually look at filling their portfolios with stocks that can provide long-term stability, rather than short-term gains. More than this, aerospace and defense stocks tend to lag behind the general market, and only experience rapid intervals of growth following the outbreak of war or conflict. Working with such a strategy would require investors to consider a mix of diverse defense options that provide them with an assumed outcome further supported by a forward-looking strategy and consider the play between supply and demand.', 'The bereaved reality of current affairs provides investors with an opportunity to consider long-term defense players that could be a complimentary addition to their portfolios.

Hence, adding the stock to your portfolio now seems a wise idea now.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ZION’s 2024 and 2025 earnings have been revised upward by 1.4% and 2.2%, respectively, over the past 30 days, indicating that analysts are optimistic regarding its earnings growth potential. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past three months, the company’s shares have gained 9.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 4.1%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Now, let’s discuss some of the important factors that make ZION stock worth a look.Revenue Strength: Zions has experienced a consistency in revenue growth with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3% over the last five years ended 2023. This was driven by robust loan growth, with loans and leases (net of unearned income and fees) witnessing a CAGR of 4.4% over the last four years (2019-2023). Steady loan demand, the company’s efforts to improve fee income and higher interest rates are expected to continue supporting top-line growth.Due to the tough operating environment, we project total revenues (FTE) to decline 3.9% in 2024. However, the metric is expected to rise 4.4% and 4.9% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Our estimates for total loans suggest witnessing a CAGR of 2.3% over the three years ended 2026.Driven by higher rates, the net interest margin (NIM) is likely to keep improving while rising funding costs will exert some pressure. While NIM declined in 2023, we expect the metric to have a positive impact in the near future. We project NIM to be 3.02%, 3.22% and 3.37% in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.Earnings Growth: ZION’s earnings have witnessed growth of 12.13% over the past three to five years. The company’s earnings are projected to decline 10.9% in 2024, while it will rebound and grow 5.2% in 2025.Impressive Capital Distribution: Zions has an impressive capital distribution plan. The company has been paying out dividend to its shareholders regularly. In July 2022, the bank announced an 8% hike in quarterly dividend to 41 cents per share and has maintained the payout ever since. The company has five-year annualized dividend growth of 6.84% and a payout ratio of 34% of earnings.The company has a solid share repurchase program in place. The company bought back 0.9 million shares in 2023. In February 2024, the bank authorized a share repurchase plan worth $35 million for the year. Despite not expecting large amounts of share repurchases in the immediate future, the company is anticipated to sustain efficient capital distributions supported by a robust capital position and lower dividend payout ratio compared with peers.Stock Seems Undervalued: Zions has Price/Cash Flows and Price/Earnings (F1) of 6.36 and 7.91 compared with the industry’s Price/Cash Flow and Price/Earnings (F1) of 7.49 and 12.95, respectively. The stock has a Value Score of A. Our research suggests that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the highest upside potential.', 'Northrim BanCorp, Inc.’s NRIM 2024 earnings estimates have increased 7.8% over the past 30 days.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.6%.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Fox's shares on or after the 5th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.26 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.52 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Fox has a trailing yield of 1.8% on the current stock price of US$29.44. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Fox ', ""Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Fox paying out a modest 30% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Luckily it paid out just 24% of its free cash flow last year."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fox's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 13% a year over the previous five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Fox has delivered 2.5% dividend growth per year on average over the past five years."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Fox? Earnings per share are down meaningfully, although at least the company is paying out a low and conservative percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's definitely not great to see earnings falling, but at least there may be some buffer before the dividend needs to be cut. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Fox's dividend merits."", ""So while Fox looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

Maybe I’m being pollyannish about the situation, but I believe when SATS brings its Jupiter 3 satellite online next year, and is capable of delivering the same speeds as Starlink, churn will not only slow, but subscriber counts should begin to rebound. SATS will never be competitive with respect to latency, but that doesn’t keep me up at night. That’s not to discount the draw of low latency, which is important for use cases such as video conferencing and gaming, but when your target customer base is scraping by with max speeds of just 25 Mbps, the prospect of 100 Mbps should be highly attractive.

MPLX, known for its midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, reported a strategic relationship with Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), which remains a significant source of its revenues, accounting for 50% of total revenues and other income. The partnership's commitment to safety, reliability, and efficiency, coupled with its focus on growing stable cash flows while maintaining strict capital discipline, positions it well in the competitive midstream sector. MPLX's financial tables reflect a robust financial position, with a market capitalization of approximately $12.0 billion as of June 30, 2023, and a declared distribution of $0.85 per common unit in early 2024, signaling confidence in its cash flow generation and financial health."", 'Warning!

The long-term, fee-based agreements with minimum volume commitments provide a predictable and stable revenue stream, which is crucial for the partnership's financial stability.

Furthermore, MPLX's commitment to operational excellence, cost reduction, and efficiency improvements enhances its competitive edge and ability to generate stable cash flows."", ""Dependence on MPC: While the partnership with MPC is a strength, it also presents a weakness due to MPLX's heavy reliance on a single entity for a substantial portion of its revenue. This concentration of revenue sources could expose MPLX to risks if MPC's business faces downturns or if contractual terms are renegotiated unfavorably. Diversifying its customer base could mitigate this risk and ensure more balanced revenue streams."", ""Capital Intensive Operations: The nature of MPLX's business requires significant capital investments to maintain and expand its asset base. Although the partnership practices strict capital discipline, the need for continuous capital outlays can strain financial resources and affect its ability to respond to rapid market changes or invest in new opportunities."", ""Energy Transition and ESG Initiatives: MPLX has the opportunity to align with the ongoing energy transition by investing in renewable energy and emerging technologies. The partnership's commitment to sustainability, including its efforts to reduce methane intensity and conserve natural resources, positions it favorably as investors and consumers increasingly prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in their decision-making."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and Portfolio Optimization: MPLX can leverage its financial strength and industry expertise to pursue strategic acquisitions that complement its existing assets.

Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today we will be making forward looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.', 'Andres Gluski: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial review call. Today I will discuss our 2023 strategic and financial performance. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail shortly. Beginning on slide three, 2023 was our best year ever as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial objectives, including signing a record of 5.6 gigawatts of new PPAs, putting us well on track to achieve 14 to 17 gigawatts of new signings through 2025, completing 3.5 gigawatts of construction, exceeding the target we laid out and doubling our additions compared to 2022, delivering adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion in the top end of our guidance range and adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $3.4 billion, achieving adjusted EPS of $1.76 and parent-free cash flow of just over $1 billion, both beyond the top end of our guidance ranges, and realizing asset sales proceeds of $1.1 billion, significantly above our target of $400 million to $600 million.', ""Turning to slide four, despite the backdrop of rising interest rates and supply chain challenges across the sector, we demonstrated that our business model is strong, resilient, and well-positioned. Demand across the sector has never been stronger, and in this context, I'm pleased to announce that we are raising our expected annual growth rate for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We now expect our adjusted EBITDA to grow at an annual rate of 5% to 7% and adjusted EPS to grow at 7% to 9%, both through 2027. We are also reaffirming all of our other existing guidance. I can definitely say that I have never felt better about the outlook for this business. Turning to power purchase agreement signings on slide five, we signed 5.6 gigawatts of new PPAs in 2023, more than any other year in our company's 43-year history, putting us well on track to sign 14 to 17 gigawatts of new renewable contracts from 2023 through 2025."", ""Today, our backlog of projects with signed PPAs is 12.3 gigawatts, the vast majority of which will be commissioned over the next three years. It is worthwhile to note that all of the projects in our contracted backlog remain on track for timely completion, consistent with our historical performance. Moving to slide six, I'd like to highlight that the largest segment of our new business is with corporate customers. In fact, in 2023, nearly 60% of the 3.5 gigawatts of projects we brought online were to serve corporate customers and large technology companies in particular. Bloomberg New Energy Finance has consistently named AES as one of the top two providers of renewable energy to corporations worldwide, and our business continues to expand, particularly given our focus on serving the power needs from data centers which are powering the rapid growth of AI."", 'We are well positioned to serve this customer segment for a number of reasons. First, we have been on the forefront of working directly with these technology companies to provide innovative solutions to achieve specific renewable energy profiles. Back in 2021, we were the first company to introduce hourly match renewable energy, and today we are working with all of the hyperscale data center companies to provide solutions that are tailored for their renewable energy and sustainability goals. Second, we have a strong track record of delivering our projects on time, on budget, while meeting the unique needs of our customers, which I will cover in more detail momentarily. Our record of reliability is something that is increasingly recognized and valued by our customers.', 'And third, we have the scale and the pipeline to address growing demand from data centers, which is estimated to more than double by 2030. With over 50 gigawatts of projects in our development pipeline and advanced interconnection queue positions in the most relevant markets in the U.S., we are particularly well positioned to meet the energy demand of technology customers. Turning to slide seven, our success with corporate customers combined with our improved efficiency in development and construction have increased the returns that we have seen across our renewable portfolio. As a result, we are upping our U.S. return ranges by 200 basis points to 12% to 15% on a levered after-tax cash basis. We are seeing even higher returns internationally.', ""With strong market demand in AES's leading position, we are able to be increasingly selective about the projects we build with a focus on those with the best overall financial benefits. Next, turning to construction on slide eight, our ability to complete projects on time and on budget has become a major differentiator for AES. Not only is this something that our customers highly value, but it is also a pillar of our business model and ensures that our realized financial returns are on average equal to or better than our projections. At the time of PPA signings, we lock in contractual arrangements for all major equipment, EPC, and long-term financing, which we hedge to ensure no interest rate exposure. At the same time, we systematically embed flexibility in our supply chain to safeguard against a variety of scenarios."", 'We also have a multi-year strategic arrangement with top suppliers, including Fluence, who we see as having the most competitive product in the industry. More than half of our solar projects in recent years have co-located storage components, and our relationship with Fluence helped us to have the best on-time project completion rate in the industry. In 2024, we feel very confident in our ability to add 3.6 gigawatts of new projects, including 2.2 gigawatts in the U.S. We currently have 100% of the major equipment for these projects contractually secured and nearly 80% already on site. Now turning to our utilities, beginning on slide nine. In 2023, we achieved important milestones at our U.S. utilities that will drive future growth, continue decarbonization, and improvement in customer service.', 'At AES Ohio, we put in place a new regulatory framework, and at AES Indiana, we reached a unanimous settlement for our first-rate case since 2018. As a result, investments are on track for the rate-based growth in the high teens at both utilities, and we now have close to 70% of our planned investments through 2027 already approved in regulatory orders. Turning to slide 10. At AES Ohio, we are embarking on the largest investment program that this utility has ever seen, which includes the expansion and enhancement in our transmission assets. With over 25% rate-based growth per year, this is one of the fastest transmission growth rates in the country. We also recently filed for regulatory approval of the second phase of our smart grid plan, which upgrades our grid to improve service quality and customer experience.', 'Turning to slide 11. At AES Indiana, we continue to invest to improve service quality and greener generation mix. I am happy to say that we now have regulatory approval for the build-out of all named renewable projects at AES Indiana, encompassing 106 megawatts of wind, 445 megawatts of solar, and 245 megawatts of energy storage. As we continue to invest in our customer experience, service quality, and sustainability at both of our U.S. utilities, two core principles have guided our growth plan. First is customer affordability as we address much-needed investments. We currently have the lowest residential rate in both states, which we expect to maintain throughout this period of growth. And second is to prioritize the timely recovery of our investments through existing mechanisms and programs.', 'Across both utilities, we now anticipate approximately 75% of the growth capital to be deployed under such mechanisms, which substantially reduces regulatory lag. Finally, turning to slide 12. Last year, we set an asset sale proceeds target of 400 million to 600 million. We greatly exceeded this range with 1.1 billion of gross proceeds. These transactions not only put a high valuation marker on our businesses, but also put us well on our way towards achieving our asset sales goal of $2 billion through 2025 and $3.5 billion through 2027. Our success this past year provides us with a cushion, and we expect 2024 to be another strong year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.', ""Steve Coughlin: Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our 2023 results and capital allocation, our 2024 guidance, and our updated expectations through 2027. As Andres mentioned, 2023 was AES's best year on record as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial targets. We beat our adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 and our parent-free cash flow guidance range of $950 million to $1 billion. We also recorded strong adjusted EBITDA well above the midpoint of our inaugural guidance range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Turning to slide 14, full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $3.4 billion versus $3.2 billion in 2022, driven primarily by contributions from new renewables projects, as well as the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio included as part of the ESP4 settlement."", ""These drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from the energy infrastructure SBU. Turning to slide 15, adjusted EPS was $1.76 in 2023 versus $1.67 in 2022. Drivers were similar to those for adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes. In addition, there was a $0.06 headwind from parent interest on higher debt balances primarily used to fund new renewables projects. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning with the Renewable Strategic Business Unit or SBU on slide 16. Higher adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes at our renewables SBU was primarily driven by contributions from the 3.5 gigawatts of new projects that came online in 2023, as well as higher margins in Columbia, but partially offset by the sell down of select U.S. renewable operating assets."", ""At our utilities SBU, higher adjusted PTC was primarily driven by the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio included as part of the ESP4 settlement, as well as rate-based growth in the U.S. Lower adjusted EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU reflects significant LNG transaction margins in 2022, lower margins in Chile, and the sale of a minority interest in our Southland combined cycle assets. These drivers were partially offset by the higher revenues recognized from the accelerated monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run coal plant. Finally, at our new energy technologies SBU, higher adjusted EBITDA reflects improved results at Fluence, which achieves positive adjusted EBITDA in their fiscal fourth quarter of 2023."", ""Fluence also guided to positive adjusted EBITDA for their full fiscal year 2024. Now let's turn to how we allocated our capital last year on slide 20. Beginning on the left-hand side, Sources reflect $3 billion of total discretionary cash. This includes parent-free cash flow of just over $1 billion, which increased nearly 11% from the prior year to just above the top end of our guidance. We also significantly surpassed our asset sale target with $750 million in net asset sales proceeds to the AES parent after subsidiary level debt repayment, reinvestment, and taxes. And we issued $900 million of parent debt in May of last year. Moving to Uses on the right-hand side, we invested more than $2.1 billion in growth at our subsidiary, of which approximately two-thirds was in the U.S. We also allocated more than $500 million of discretionary cash to our dividends."", ""Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our financial performance throughout 2023. Now let's turn to our guidance and expectations, beginning on slide 21. Today, we're initiating 2024 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, driven by over $500 million in contributions from new renewables projects and from rate-based growth at our U.S. utilities. We have also incorporated a $200 million partially offsetting impact from asset sales we either closed in 2023 or plan to close this year. Excluding the $1 billion in tax attributes we expect to recognize in 2024, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. The increase in tax attributes versus the prior year is partially due to our continued use of tax credit transfers, which results in earlier recognition of tax credit than typical tax equity structures."", ""In addition, last year's increase in new project completions will drive higher tax attribute recognition in 2024. As a reminder, we will recognize approximately one-third of tax attributes generated on 2023 projects in the 2024 fiscal year. Looking beyond this year, our head start on asset sales gives us greater visibility toward our longer-term growth and puts downward pressure on our capital budget. We expect EBITDA to increase each year through the remainder of our long-term guidance period. Turning to slide 22, we expect 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.87 to $1.97, which represents a 9% increase year-over-year and puts us on track to achieve our 7% to 9% long-term growth target through 2025. Growth will be primarily driven by our renewables and utilities businesses and will be partially offset by higher parent interest."", ""We also expect an 8% headwind from asset sales. Our construction program this year is more evenly spread than in recent years. As a result, we expect approximately 40% of our earnings to be recognized in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. And we will have greater visibility throughout the year into our expected construction completion. Turning to slide 23, as Andres mentioned, our very strong market position in providing tailored solutions to corporate clients, including large data centers, has allowed us to realize higher returns on our renewable’s projects. In addition, as our renewables business continues to scale, we anticipate further realization of productivity and scale benefits. Based on these factors and our 2023 results, we now expect AES's U.S. renewables returns to be in the 12% to 15% range."", 'These higher returns in the U.S., along with productivity benefits, are directly accreted to our earnings and cash flow, and as a result, we are increasing our expected long-term adjusted EBITDA growth rate to 5% to 7% and our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate to 7% to 9% through 2027 off of base of our 2023 guidance midpoint. Now, turning to our 2024 parent capital allocation plan on slide 24, beginning with approximately $3.1 billion of Sources on the left-hand side. Parent free cash flow for 2024 is expected to be around $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. We expect to generate $900 million to $1.1 billion of net asset sale proceeds this year. By the end of this year, we expect to be more than halfway toward the $3.5 billion gross asset sales target we announced on our third quarter earnings call.', 'Although we expect an increase of approximately $1 billion of parent debt this year, our business is well insulated from changes in interest rates. Our new projects are funded primarily with fixed rate or long-term hedged self-amortizing debt with tenors similar to the length of our PPAs, and more than 80% of our outstanding debt is non-recourse to AES Corp. Our exposure from floating rates and future issuances is managed with nearly $8 billion in outstanding hedging. Looking at the impact of a 100 basis point shift in rates on our future issuances, refinancing’s and outstanding U.S. floating rate debt, we have only one penny of EPS exposure from interest rates in 2024. Now to the Uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest approximately $2.6 billion in new growth, of which about 85% will be allocated to growing our renewables portfolio and utility rate base.', ""More than 90% of this will be directed into the U.S., with the remainder going to growth projects in Chile and Panama. We expect to allocate approximately $500 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects the previously announced 4% increase. Turning to slide 25, our long-term sources of parent capital through 2027 reflect the accelerated asset sales target we introduced on our third quarter call. We also expect higher organic cash generation as a result of our increased long-term growth rates. As a reminder, we will not issue any new equity until 2026 at the earliest, and we'll only do so in a way that creates value on a per share basis. Now to slide 26. Uses through 2027 reflect more than $7 billion of investment in our subsidiaries, primarily to grow our renewables and utilities businesses."", 'We also expect to allocate more than $2 billion to our dividend. Given our surplus of attractive investment opportunities and our desire to minimize equity issuance as a source of capital, we now expect to grow our dividend at 2% to 3% annually beyond 2024. We believe this provides an optimal balance between an already attractive dividend yield and strong earnings and cash flow growth throughout our planned period. In summary, 2023 was an extraordinary year for AES. We demonstrated our ability to adapt to the current market and execute on our growth commitments while we further advanced our competitive position. As we continue to perfect and scale our renewables machine, we expect to have another record year in 2024 and to deliver on our now higher long-term growth target.', ""We have positioned AES to achieve our strategic priorities and grow our business in a way that's highly value accretive to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."", 'Andres Gluski: Thank you, Steve. In summary, 2023 was our best year ever as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial objectives across our guidance metrics, PPA signings, construction completions, and asset sales. We are seeing strong demand for renewables across the sector, particularly due to the unprecedented demand from data centers. As a result, we are not only upping our U.S. project return ranges, but increasing our expected average annual growth rates for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share through 2027. Finally, our significant success with asset sales to date, as well as the outlook for the near future, gives us great comfort in our long-term funding plans. With that, I would like to open the call for questions.', 'See also 12 Things Retirees Need to Know About Social Security and Taxes and 11 Best Brewery and Distillery Stocks to Buy Now.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

If you're looking for a cross-country trip, you're certainly going to want to be looking at that. And there are two apps that you can be looking at."", 'The one I recommend is PlugShare. And that is a user-generated app where users around the country that drive EVs are posting where those charging stations are. You can find exactly how many chargers are in individual locations. How many are working?', ""Although, I will warn that that's not always accurate. You can, of course, also find information on Google Maps which tells you where some of those key Chargers are, Julie."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And then, OK. So you've mapped out your trip.

So you're going to want to try and avoid that."", 'Level 2 is the most common. Accounts for roughly 70% of all public chargers. You get about 10 to 30 miles per hour.', 'And the one you really want to look for here is the level 3 DC fast chargers, 100 to 200 plus miles per 30 minutes.

So that's going to be probably the most frustrating part of your drive because you won't know exactly."", ""There's also limited availability of chargers. So you might have to wait in line to get that full charge. And the key here as you're planning out all this, be conservative in your estimation of the range."", ""I would say leave about 10% there. You don't want to be stuck in a place with very little charge with no chargers at all. So that's a key thing to consider here."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, that is definitely a key thing to consider. I mean, it seems like there's also kind of a business opportunity here.

To skip the detailed analysis of the automotive industry, go directly to the 5 Best Fuel Efficient Cars Under $30K.', 'The automotive industry is changing rapidly due to the fast pace of technology growth. Over the last few years, oil and gas prices have been quite volatile, and there has been a growing trend of moving toward alternative fuel sources to power our vehicles. According to one of our reports from 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted 14 million electric vehicle (EV) sales in 2023. While the sales didn’t exactly hit IEA’s target, it certainly came close with 13.6 million EV sales worldwide. Reuters reported that EV sales growth was 31% in 2023, compared to 60% in 2022.\xa0', 'In the US, EV sales growth was quite significant, and a record 1.2 million units were sold in the country in 2023.

Sensigo is a California-based startup that uses artificial intelligence for car repair purposes.', 'The growth of the EV industry has provided many new companies to make a mark in the automotive industry. However, older and well-established companies like Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) have entered the race to capture the EV market share. Additionally, these companies have also dominated the internal combustion engine (ICE) industry for years, which means they have loaded up on a lot of cash to make the transition toward the EV industry easier when the time is right.', 'According to our previous report, the electric vehicles industry is expected to reach $1.57 trillion by 2030 and grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22.1%. These big names are already trying to carve out a big chunk of the market share. Furthermore, they are also producing vehicles that are pocket-friendly.', 'There are no better fuel-efficient cars than EVs and hybrids, but their price tag makes them harder to buy.

For each car’s fuel economy information, we took a mean of the data we gathered from our sources. Our methodology is based on the reviews of several sources that authentically review vehicles. We avoided basing the methodology on reviews posted on public discussion forums such as Reddit because personal experiences of people vary from each other. For example, one individual mentioned that their Honda Civic averages 36 mpg while another person claimed that they managed to get 29 mpg. The difference was between their route and driving style."", 'Next, we chose the 15 best fuel-efficient vehicles under $30k based on each car’s combined fuel economy (highway and city) and price. For example, if two cars had a combined fuel economy of 31 miles per gallon, we chose the car with the lower starting MSRP.

Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company.

Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$4.79b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.77 in 2024.

The most optimistic Pinnacle West Capital analyst has a price target of US$95.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$68.00.

By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.4% annually.

I will now turn the call over to Andrew.', 'Andrew Cooper: Thank you, Amanda, and thank everyone for joining us today. I will first cover our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results before handing it to Jeff who will discuss our recent rate case outcome growth outlook and strategy. Afterwards I will finish up with our 2024 guidance and long-term financial outlook. In the fourth quarter of 2023 we achieved a $0.21 increase in earnings per share compared to the same quarter in 2022. This year-over-year improvement was largely driven by a $0.41 uplift in gross margin attributable to increased sales and usage as well as higher transmission revenue and contributions from the LFCR and 2019 rate case appeal. The lack of certain prior period items from Q4 2022 contributed to a $0.21 benefit to other income and expense on a year-over-year basis.', 'These increases versus the prior year were partially offset by higher O&M expense, depreciation amortization, interest expense and benefit costs. For the full year 2023, we earned $4.41 per share, a $0.15 increase over 2022 surpassing our guidance range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share. A significant factor in this result was a $0.22 year-over-year weather benefit driven by an unprecedented summer heat wave during the third quarter. Overall weather contributed $0.48 in 2023 compared to normal weather. Revenues from adjuster mechanisms, transmission and increased sales and usage were also positive drivers for the year. In addition other income and expense was $0.33 higher year-over-year driven by the lack of certain prior expense items from 2022 and the sale of Bright Canyon assets in the third quarter of 2023.', ""These increases versus 2022 were partially offset by higher O&M expense, depreciation amortization, interest expense and benefit costs. Overall we ended 2023 with 2% customer growth maintaining the years-long upper trajectory of consistent growth in our service territory. Weather normalized sales growth was within the expected guidance range at 1.5% in 2023 driven by 3.3%growth in our C&I customer segments. I'll now pass the discussion to Jeff to talk about our rate case outcome growth outlook and strategy before I continue with our 2024 guidance and long-term financial outlook."", ""Jeff Guldner: Great, thank you Andrew. And thank you all for joining us today. As you all know just a few days ago the commission voted to approve our 2022 rate case. I'm pleased to say that this rate case decision was ultimately reasonable and constructive. I'll highlight a few of the main outcomes including an improved authorized return on equity, the approval of a new generation rider and a balanced revenue requirement increase among other items. I'll also discuss our growth outlook and future strategy coming out of this case. Lastly as Andrew mentioned, he'll provide our 2024 guidance and our long-term financial outlook. After the unconstructive outcome of our 2019 rate case we designed a comprehensive strategy and plan and I'm pleased to share that we have accomplished the goals that we set out two years ago."", ""We executed on a strategy centered on creating shareholder value by creating customer value and we've seen significant improvements in our J.D. Power survey results. Not only have we been successful in moving from fourth quartile in 2021 to second quartile at the end of 2023 for both our residential and our business customers, we finished the year second amongst all large investor-owned utilities in phone customer care and in Perfect Power. Reliability has continued to be a top priority and we're once again top quartile meeting this milestone 10 years out of the last 11. This reliability was put on full display during the summer of 2023 when Arizona broke numerous heat records yet our team delivered outstanding performance for our customers."", ""Another important goal that we set was to build more collaborative relationships with stakeholders in the regulatory process and we succeeded in achieving supportive regulatory decisions and that include both the efficient implementation of our successful 2019 rate case appeal, as well as the most recent rate case. And finally we focused on shareholder value by deferring any equity issuances and continuing to grow our dividend during this challenging period. Now, I'll walk through some of the major highlights of the rate case. The commission adopted a net revenue increase of $253.4 million. From the very beginning we focused this rate case on improving the authorized ROE to recognize the risk and the investment needed to serve our rapidly growing service territory and the commission did that."", ""The commission voted to adopt an authorized return on equity of 9.55% with a 0.25%fair value increment in combination of those two is equivalent to a 9.85 return on equity. With this decision the commission has adopted an authorized return that's more in line with national averages and it recognizes that we're one of the fastest growing states in the nation and we need to attract capital in order to fund the investments necessary to reliably serve our customers. In addition the commission voted to approve our request for a system reliability benefit surcharge. This is an important surcharge that will allow us to invest in much needed generation resources to continue to serve our customers reliably and affordably while reducing regulatory lag."", ""Importantly the SRB will allow for the most cost-effective generation resources to be built for the benefit of our customers and to promote a healthier balance of PPAs and utility-owned assets. Later on Andrew will discuss how the SRB provides future opportunities for CapEx growth. It's also noteworthy that the commissioners made positive amendments to the revised recommended opinion in order at the open meeting that increased the net revenue requirement and addressed some items that would have created additional regulatory lag. This highlights the improved regulatory environment and our ability to achieve constructive outcomes. However, even at the final net revenue requirement the outcome underscores the continued challenge from lagging historical costs."", ""We look forward to working with the commission on addressing these lagging costs in the near future through both the regulatory lag docket which will have a workshop on March the 19th as well as through future rate case filings. Now, I'll share our next step and strategies as we look to the future. We're focused on solid execution and continue to remain optimistic about our future for many reasons and I'll discuss each of these reasons in more detail. First I'm optimistic about our attractive service territory and consistent customer growth. Arizona remains among the fastest growing states in the nation. Where other states have been experiencing little or negative customer growth we've been benefiting from steady and consistent retail customer growth of 2% for the last few years and project that growth to continue in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% in 2024."", ""We believe that the constructive business environment with ample job growth, a competitive cost of living and a desirable climate will continue to grow the Metro Phoenix market and benefit the local economy. Focusing on our service territory specifically we continue to see development from a variety of sectors which is helping to diversify our local economy more than ever. The availability of a skilled workforce and our state's business friendly policies and regulations coupled with our low propensity for natural disasters and our clean energy development potential make us uniquely situated for growth. The tremendous demand that we see from large commercial and industrial customers will help spread fixed costs over increasing sales and has a positive multiplier impact for jobs and surrounding communities."", ""We'll continue to focus our economic development approach on helping to attract and expand businesses and job creators. As you can see from this graphic from the Arizona Commerce Authority the diversity of the commercial and industrial growth in Arizona presents exciting opportunities. Our state is seeing growth in a wide range of sectors driven by manufacturing reshoring, the clean economy and digital infrastructure needs which will help reduce the risk of any potential downturns in a particular industry to keep our economy and growth stable. Turning to our regulatory environment, we've seen meaningful improvement through the last couple of years. The Arizona Corporation Commission has established a record of balanced and constructive decisions including our most recent rate case and importantly beyond those decisions the commission has also recognized the need to address regulatory lag in a holistic matter and has opened a docket to review and discuss various solutions going forward and as I mentioned we'll kick off next month."", ""We look forward to working with the commission on addressing this important issue. In addition, the commission reaffirmed its policy on settlements. Historically outcomes achieved through settlement have delivered new and innovative customer programs and other results that benefit a broad and diverse range of stakeholder interests in our state's energy future. We believe the nature of the settlement process itself yields more informed constructive and mutually beneficial results. The third reason that we're confident is the clear path that we're on in our transition to clean energy. We came out with our clean energy commitment in early 2020 and I'm proud that we've made significant progress. We plan on retiring our remaining Challo units by next year and to completely exit coal by 2031."", ""Since our clean energy commitment we've procured nearly 5,000 megawatts of additional clean energy and storage and issued another all-source RFP for an additional thousand megawatts of reliable capacity including at least 700 megawatts of renewable energy. With the approval of the SRB mechanism in this rate case we're even better positioned to establish ownership in these new clean energy assets for our customers benefit. The fourth reason I'm optimistic about the future is because of the tremendous amount of growth and opportunities we have in our FERC jurisdictional transmission business. We've increased our core transmission spend for the next three years and expect to have a much greater need for transmission capital spend over the next decade."", ""We recently filed our 10-year transmission system plan with the corporation commission showing five critical transmission projects that are needed to strengthen resiliency, support the growing energy needs of our customers, and allow for greater access to a diversity of resources in markets across the region. The total investment for APS's portion of these projects is estimated to total over $5 billion over the next 10 years. We look forward to developing this critical infrastructure that's necessary to continue to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. And finally and I'm optimistic about the future because my entire management team and I have been committed to executing a customer-centric strategy that will allow us to deliver exceptional customer service."", ""As I mentioned earlier we've made significant progress in our J.D. Power survey results and have moved from fourth quartile in 2021 to second quartile at the end of 2023. Additionally we're focused on delivering on our goal to provide reliable energy to our customers in the most affordable manner. Increases in our rates remain well below the rate of inflation even with the latest rate case decision. We remain focused on customer affordability and keeping it central to our plans to provide long-term sustainable growth. That focus coupled with continued cost management creates rate headroom for the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Andrew to provide guidance and share our long-term financial outlook."", ""Andrew Cooper: Thanks Jeff. I'll now discuss our 2024 guidance and future financial outlook. For our 2024 outlook we are establishing an EPS guidance range of $4.60 to $4.80 per share reflecting the additional revenues from our recent rate case outcome with new rates effective March 8th. This revenue is partially offset by continued drag from increased expenses not captured in our historical test year. As Jeff mentioned this rate case was balanced and constructive and this decision will create a solid foundation from which we will grow. However it is important to highlight that we continue to face significant regulatory lag due to the timing of our historical test year which ended June 30th of 2022. This lag is mainly due to higher interest rates on borrowed capital, higher depreciation due to increased rate-based growth, lower contributions from pension on service credits, and increased O&M expense due to planned generation outages."", ""We are encouraged by the commission's focus on holistically addressing regulatory lag through the newly created regulatory lag docket. We are committed to addressing these current costs in our next rate case and working with the commission to find solutions to reduce these impacts on our current construct. Our commitment to mitigating regulatory lag is a priority aiming to preserve our financial stability and build shareholder value between rate cases. Diving a bit deeper into 2024 the largest positive driver of our guidance will be new revenues from the implementation of the rate case decision. Other positive drivers are expected to include increased revenues from sales growth, the LFCR, and the full-year impact of the 2019 rate case appeal outcome."", 'The most significant year-over-year negative driver is expected to be weather due to the record-breaking heat wave we saw in 2023 as we plan for normal weather. Other negative drivers are expected to be higher depreciation and harmonization expense, increased financing costs, and higher O&M primarily due to planned outages. Turning to customer growth, as Jeff mentioned, we once again expect our customer growth to be within the range of 1.5% to 2.5%, which continues to highlight the attractiveness of our state and service territory for customer in migration. For 2024 sales growth, we expect 2% to 4% growth of which 2.5% to 3.5%is driven by extra high load factor C&I customers. These sales create operating leverage and ultimately rate headroom for all customers.', ""We've seen a steady ramping of these customers and anticipate they will continue to ramp through 2024. Longer term, we expect our weather normalized sales growth to be within the range of 4% to 6%through 2026 with 3%to 5%of this growth driven by our large C&I customers. Turning now to what we strive to provide investors going forward I will discuss our financial outlook and goals. We are rebasing our long-term EPS growth guidance of 5% to 7%off the midpoint of our 2024 guidance range of $4.60 to $4.80 per share. While our financial plan supports this growth rate for the long term, our goal is to work toward a more consistent and timely cost recovery profile. We have already made solid progress toward reducing regulatory lag with the commission approving the system reliability benefit surcharge."", 'While this mechanism will enable more timely cost recovery for utility-owned generation, we must first develop these projects before the mechanism begins recovering costs. Therefore, this mechanism has the potential to create strong value in the future, but we must first work through the natural development cycle and get projects in service. In addition, the commission has reiterated its policy on settlements which may streamline future rate case filings while creating even more collaboration between parties. Finally, we will engage with regulators to holistically address regulatory lag through the newly created docket and commit our cadence of future rate cases to ensure we are recovering our material costs. We are allocating $6 billion for investment through 2026, contributing to a 14% increase in our capital investment profile compared to this time last year.', 'This plan incorporates additional capital investment in generation that will qualify for the new SRB mechanism. In addition, an increasing portion of our capital plan is directed towards bolster in our FERC jurisdictional transmission infrastructure. Average annual spend is now more than double what it was as recently as five years ago. We have designed a well balanced capital allocation strategy that optimizes our ability to receive timely recovery for investments while providing reliable service across our rapidly growing service territory. Importantly, the SRB will expand our capacities of self-build generation to meet customer needs while reducing lag. Projects that meet the requirements of the all-source RFP and compete from a cost and reliability perspective would qualify for recovery through the SRB.', 'We expect approved projects to be included in rates within approximately 180 days of in-service, significantly shortening the time between investment and recovery on those assets compared to a traditional rate case. Recovery will be at the prevailing weighted average cost of capital less 100 basis points until a future rate case. This discount will provide customers an immediate benefit while achieving rate gradualism and reducing lag. We have highlighted five potential near-term opportunities to secure project cost recovery through the SRB with final outcomes dependent on ongoing procurement processes. Additional opportunities are also expected to arise based on future RFP outcomes and projects aligning with this mechanism. The expansion of our capital investment plan is poised to drive substantial rate based growth.', 'Consequently, we are revising our rate based growth guidance to an annual CAGR of 6% to 8%. In addition, with the adoption of the SRB, we now expect an increase in tracked capital, which will reduce regulatory lag in the future. By increasing our transmission spend and generation investment that qualifies for the SRB, we expect a double the amount of tracked capital which will improve our ability to receive timely cost recovery and reduce the amount to be recovered in future rate cases. To fortify our capital structure and support our robust capital expenditure plan, we are planning to issue a mix of debt and equity securities over the 2024 through 2026 period. Our principal goal is to have a healthy capital structure at the utility with no less than 50% equity.', ""We have noted since 2021 the need for up to 500 million of equity to support a balanced utility capital structure. You'll recall this was deferred over the past two plus years as we sought to inflate shareholders as we work to improve the regulatory environment in Arizona. The capital structure need has grown by an additional 100 million to 200 million over that time and will be required to true up our equity ratio. At the same time, our CapEx profile has grown by almost 15%, nearly $1 billion over a four-year window. While we will pursue a blend of financing solutions across APS and Pinnacle West to address our investment objectives, sources of incremental capital may include up to $400 million of additional equity or equity-length securities over the period, size to approximately 40% of this incremental CapEx. The financing options for this incremental CapEx may potentially include at the market issuances, but we will continue to evaluate alternatives to common equity."", 'As we advance into 2024, our dedication to cost management continues to guide our operations. Core O&M is declining year-over-year despite continued inflation, which supports our long-term goal of reduced O&M per megawatt hour. Notably, planned major outages are scheduled for four corners in a five, Redhawk and West Phoenix, with refilling outages at Palo Verde, marking a critical phase in our maintenance strategy. The four corners outage at Unit 5 specifically is the last major planned outage at the unit before its retirement, with the last major planned outage at Unit 4 scheduled for spring of 2025. Despite these necessary planned outages, our commitment to operational efficiency and lean practices remains intact for the long term. Our goal of declining O&M per megawatt hour is strongly established and underscores our effective cost management with rapid growth in our service territory.', 'The second chart on this slide highlights our success in maintaining O&M cost increases below the rate of inflation since 2017, outperforming both national CPI trends and more specifically, local inflation rates in Phoenix. This achievement is a testament to our unwavering focus on optimizing operations and fostering a culture of efficiency across our organization. We continue to provide an attractive dividend yield as part of our total shareholder return and maintain a goal of managing our payout ratio into a sustained range of 65% to 75% in the future. With a solid track record of annual dividend growth, we understand the importance of returning value to our investors. We are committed to working diligently to ensure our dividend remains competitive.', 'Turning to our credit ratings, following our recent rate case resolution and other developments in the Arizona regulatory climate, we are working with the rating agencies as they evaluate our credit. Healthy investment grade credit ratings are pivotal to our financial profile as they contribute to reducing borrowing costs, thereby directly benefiting our customers through more favorable financial conditions. We are adjusting our FFO/debt target range to 14% to 16% to properly balance the financing needs of the company and solid credit metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong, reinforcing our financial foundation. This balance sheet strength provides us flexibility to navigate the current interest rate environment and strategically address our near-term maturities as well as ongoing and future investment needs.', ""Looking back at the last few years and the strides we've made, we are enthusiastic about our future and the potential of the company. Overcoming the setbacks of the prior rate case, we achieved the goal set forth during the preceding two years and we've aligned closely with the commission and stakeholders to secure a constructive outcome in this rate case. While challenges such as regulatory lag persist, our commitment to seek collaborative solutions with stakeholders, ACC staff, and the commission remains firm. Our dedication to keeping customer costs affordable is evident through our efficient O&M practices seeking to ensure that rates and costs stay below inflation during this period of unprecedented growth in our service territory. With a more constructive regulatory environment and a continued focus on affordability, we look forward to approaching the future with a clear vision and optimism for our customers and investors."", ""This concludes our prepared remarks.

We made one investment (Analog Devices, Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:ADI) in Large Cap) that we thought was compelling, but it wasn’t until late 2021 when the semiconductor industry entered a severe downturn, that we began purchasing semiconductor stocks in earnest. Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially. It turned out that the downturn was more severe than most other investors or industry observers had forecasted. Thus, semiconductor stocks in general remain depressed, and our investments have so far shown mixed results.', 'However, we have not changed our view on the long-term attractiveness of the industry segments in which they operate, nor on the normalized earning power of these companies five to ten years out. Thus, we have been consistently adding to our exposure for the past two years, which, in addition to Analog Devices, now includes Microchip Technology (Mid Cap), MKS Instruments (Mid Cap), and Texas Instruments (Large Cap), the last of which was a new purchase in 2023.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SBAC.', ""On February 28, 2024, SBA Communications Corp (NASDAQ:SBAC), a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, filed its annual 10-K report with the SEC. The company, which operates almost 40,000 cell towers across multiple continents, continues to demonstrate financial resilience and strategic growth. With a site leasing business that accounted for 97.4% of its total segment operating profit in 2023, and a strong international presence that contributed 24.7% of total revenues, SBA Communications Corp is well-positioned in the market. The company's focus on expanding its site leasing business through organic growth and market expansion is evident in its strategic initiatives. However, challenges such as increasing competition and potential economic and political risks in international markets are also part of the landscape. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in the latest financial filings, providing investors with a comprehensive view of SBA Communications Corp's strategic position."", ""Robust Site Leasing Business: SBA Communications Corp's site leasing business is a significant strength, contributing 97.4% of the company's total segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2023. The company's ability to lease space to wireless service providers on assets it owns or operates, coupled with managing rooftop and tower sites for property owners, has established a reliable revenue stream. The control over underlying land positions, with approximately 71% of towers located on land owned or controlled for more than 20 years, enhances the company's stability and bargaining power. This strong foundation in site leasing is a testament to the company's strategic focus and operational efficiency."", ""International Market Presence: SBA Communications Corp's international operations, which generated approximately 24.7% of total revenues, underscore the company's global reach and diversification. With a significant presence in Brazil and other markets, the company benefits from a broadened customer base and reduced reliance on any single market. This international footprint not only provides growth opportunities but also serves as a hedge against domestic market fluctuations. The company's strategic approach to international expansion, focusing on markets with attractive wireless industry prospects and stable political environments, further solidifies this strength."", ""Concentrated Customer Base: Despite its strong market position, SBA Communications Corp faces a weakness in the form of a concentrated customer base. Most revenue in each market is generated by just the top few mobile carriers. This concentration increases the company's dependence on a limited number of clients, which could lead to significant revenue impacts if any key customer reduces demand or changes their business strategy. Diversifying the customer base could mitigate this risk and provide a more stable revenue outlook."", ""Exposure to International Risks: While international operations are a strength, they also present a weakness due to exposure to economic, political, and regulatory risks. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, and local laws can impact profitability and operational efficiency. The company's exit from the Argentinian market in the fourth quarter of 2023 exemplifies the potential volatility in international markets. Managing these risks requires constant vigilance and adaptability to ensure sustained international growth."", ""Organic Growth and Market Expansion: SBA Communications Corp has the opportunity to further expand its site leasing business organically, as evidenced by the company's strategic focus on leveraging local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers. The ongoing demand for wireless services and the company's expertise in local markets position it well to capitalize on new tower build opportunities and participate in site development projects. Additionally, the company's exploration of ancillary services and evolving technologies, such as edge data centers and private networks, presents opportunities to create additional value and expand its business within the growing communications ecosystem."", ""Strategic Acquisitions: The company's strategy includes opportunistic international market expansion and acquisitions that meet its return criteria. With a disciplined approach to evaluating potential markets and acquisitions, SBA Communications Corp can continue to grow its tower portfolio and enhance its market position. The company's financial strength and experience in integrating acquisitions provide a solid foundation for pursuing strategic opportunities that align with its long-term objectives."", ""Increasing Competition: The tower industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with fewer acquisition opportunities available due to industry consolidation. SBA Communications Corp faces the threat of more competition for acquisitions, which may result in higher prices and difficulty in negotiating tower purchases. Additionally, the company's ability to build new towers depends on customer needs and the availability of attractive locations, which are also subject to competitive pressures. Navigating this competitive landscape requires strategic foresight and the ability to differentiate from competitors."", ""Economic and Political Instability in International Markets: SBA Communications Corp's international operations expose it to risks associated with economic and political instability. Changes in a country's political or economic conditions, such as inflation or currency devaluation, can materially affect revenues and financial positions. The company must continuously monitor these risks and adapt its strategies accordingly to mitigate potential adverse effects on its international business."", 'In conclusion, SBA Communications Corp (NASDAQ:SBAC) exhibits a robust site leasing business and a strong international presence, which are key strengths that provide a stable revenue stream and growth opportunities. However, the company must address weaknesses such as a concentrated customer base and exposure to international risks to maintain its competitive edge', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The company’s Computer & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.

It expects net revenues to increase in the low double digits for fiscal 2024.Visa, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing bottom-line growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.The company beat earnings estimates by 3.4% in the fiscal first quarter of 2024. However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia-Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)Amgen’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+24.3% vs. -4.5%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in the future quarters.The addition of Horizon Therapeutics has given Amgen a significant rare disease business. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several data readouts are expected in the next 12 months.However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimates have gone up ahead of Q4 earnings release.

While dividend payments have never been the first priority of the Oracle of Omaha while looking for new investments, he does give them a lot of importance and almost always mentions his portfolio companies with growing dividends in his annual letters. In his latest annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett talked about Coca-Cola\xa0Co (NYSE:KO) and American Express\xa0Company (NYSE:AXP), in which Berkshire owns $24 billion and $28 billion worth of stakes, respectively.', '""During 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke – extending our own Rip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of AMEX earnings in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase. Both AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 – about 16% in the case of AMEX – and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the year. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell you: “No way.”', 'Though Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect ownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made at Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every asset that Berkshire owns. To this obvious but often overlooked truth, I add my usual caveat: All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done at a premium.', 'The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', 'Buffett loves it when he does not have to touch his stakes and let the investments do all the work. He believes his investments are rewarded when the companies he has invested in increase dividends and focus on shareholder returns.', 'Methodology', ""But Coca Cola and American Express aren’t the only two dividend-paying stocks in Buffett's portfolio. In this article we scanned Berkshire's Q4 portfolio and picked 15 stocks that pay dividends.

In January T-Mobile Us Inc (NAQSDAQ:TMUS) posted fourth quarter results, according which T-Mobile Us Inc's (NAQSDAQ:TMUS) GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $1.67, missing estimates by $0.23. Revenue in the period inched up 1% year over year to $20.48 billion, beating estimates by $810 million."", 'ClearBridge Dividend Strategy made the following comment about T-Mobile US, Inc.

T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile’s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost. T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.', 'This combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition. In the three years since completing its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has grown its post-paid subscriber base by about 22%. Over the same period, AT&T’s has grown by about 14%, while Verizon’s by less than 5%.', 'Given the high fixed-cost nature of the wireless business, these steady increases in revenue growth have led to outsize increases in profits and free cash flow. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to come in around $13.5 billion, up from less than $8 billion last year. In 2024 free cash flow is expected to grow by over 20% to approximately $17 billion — providing a 10% yield based on today’s stock price.', 'We have long admired T-Mobile, but until recently the stock did not pay a dividend. The company announced its inaugural dividend in September, and we bought the stock shortly thereafter. The initial yield is about 2% and it is expected to grow about 10% per year.”', ""Warren Buffett's Stake:\xa0$1,193,182,000"", ""Professional services and management consulting company Aon Plc (NYSE:AON) is one of the low-yield dividend stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio.

The company boasts a diversified deposits base with about 80% FDIC insured, well above industry average. It is the only major bank 100% in the cloud, which enables better underwriting and quicker response to changes in the environment. This technology also helps reduce operating and fraud cost while freeing up cash flow for reinvestment in marketing to grow products (Venture X card) and build its brand. Periods of stress, like we saw in the banking sector during March, are a reminder of the underwriting acumen and high quality deposits of Capital One. We added to our position after the fallout, knowing that the company’s seasoned management team had steered capably through previous cycles. Today, as credit card delinquencies have risen to more normal levels, Capital One is already reporting a slowing in delinquency growth. Conversely, some peers saw prior underwriting missteps begin to surface in 2023.

Mastercard has long built AI-based products to enhance payment security and provide merchants with rich data analytics. In December, they rolled out Muse, a new online shopping companion that merchants who utilize certain Mastercard services can install on their own websites.', 'Muse seeks to replicate the instore experience of working with a salesclerk by allowing the customer to use natural language to browse products.

The network continues to grow, with credentials and merchant locations up 7% and 17%, respectively. Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth, increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% yearon-year, progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances.

Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons could accelerate the company’s earnings growth and produce additional scale advantages.

As per the report from Research and Markets, this growth is attributed to factors like increased disposable income, higher internet penetration, a low-interest-rate environment, and increased investments. The market is expected to continue growing, reaching $708.41 billion in 2028 at a CAGR of 6.5%. Key drivers include a rising demand for electronic components in display devices, IoT growth, and lucrative opportunities. Anticipated trends include 3D printed electronic components, increased merger and acquisition activities, integration of AI and machine learning in manufacturing, adoption of modular connector systems for transportation, and more collaborations. The growth is fueled by increasing demand for specific components like microwave tubes, cathode-ray tubes, X-ray tubes, photoelectric tubes, and triodes in display devices, particularly with the proliferation of smart devices. The Asia-Pacific region, led by China, plays a significant role in this growth, with major contributions from chip designers, chipmakers, and critical components used in various applications.\xa0', ""As the electronic components industry enters 2024, it reflects a pivotal moment marked by recovery from recent geopolitical challenges. Fusion Worldwide's assessment reveals key themes shaping the industry's trajectory. The aftermath of extreme shortages, record-high lead times, and pricing fluctuations in 2022 led to significant overbuying in 2023, resulting in substantial excess inventory across different sectors. The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, expected to contribute $1.3 trillion in growth by 2032, continues to exert a profound influence on market dynamics. Tensions between the US and China persist, stemming from past tariffs on chipmaking and trade, creating a delicate balancing act as China seeks to avert a recession. Additionally, global conflicts in Israel and Ukraine pose threats to the electronic components supply chain, impacting manufacturing, machinery, investment, and consumer confidence.\xa0"", 'Per the Fusion Worldwide report, the electronic components industry in 2024 showcases distinct dynamics across different market sectors. In the aerospace and defense sector, there is a robust demand for components supporting builds in both industries. The increasing electrical complexity in commercial airplanes contributes to reliable demand. On the automotive front, the sector faced challenges in keeping pace with the global chip shortage but has regained control, enjoying a generally favorable long-term outlook. However, challenges such as pricing volatility must be navigated. Contract manufacturers are expected to remain a focal point of industry discussions in 2024 and beyond. The industry anticipates an uptick in offshoring activities, particularly in emerging countries, coupled with positive changes in the regulatory landscape driving growth. Enterprise computing and servers emerge as exciting opportunities in the electronic component landscape. The ever-growing need for data and computing positions this sector to reach its full potential, influencing critical areas such as AI, IoT, graphics, multimedia, telecommunications, and beyond. The telecom and networking segment, crucial for enabling AI, IoT, and edge computing, foresees sustained high-margin activities, largely insulated from significant challenges in the long run. In the gaming industry, which faced notable obstacles in 2020 and 2021, a rebound is expected. Graphics cards and GPUs remain significant elements, but the landscape is evolving with the rising popularity of cloud gaming, virtual reality, augmented reality, and AI, sparking demand for more advanced components. In the healthcare sector, where operational expenses are a significant consideration, disruptive technologies hold transformative potential. The adoption of AI, remote patient monitoring devices, and digitized diagnostic equipment could reshape paradigms in the field.

Approximately 55% of 175 surveyed news executives expressed optimism about their company's prospects in the next 12 months, and 58% were optimistic about the next three years. This signals a shift towards cautious optimism compared to the previous year's report. Despite layoffs and challenges in 2023, publishers anticipate a 2024 revenue growth of 18.5%. However, news media advertising was expected to decline by approximately 4.6% in 2023 and 3.1% in 2024. Global newspaper advertising spend has decreased, with print decline outpacing digital progress. Areas like platform partnerships and business services gained importance for publishers, while events, data, and memberships declined. Major upcoming elections and the 2024 Paris Olympics are predicted to boost revenues and audience engagement. Key areas for investment include reader revenue, product development, and diversifying revenue streams. Artificial intelligence is a top priority for investment, followed by data analytics, video, and audio/podcasts.

Publishers show increased interest in platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram, following Meta's decision to open broadcast channels. Despite challenges, publishers plan to create more video content, newsletters, and podcasts while maintaining the number of news articles. However, 54% admit a focus on maximizing attention rather than respecting audience time. On the business side, 80% of publishers view subscription and membership as crucial revenue streams.

Media companies are integrating artificial intelligence into different aspects of their operations, focusing on productivity and incremental growth.

There is a renewed emphasis on fresh storytelling and excellence in 2024, moving away from overreliance on long-running franchises.

The New York Times, which has a smaller audience reach than Gannett, undertook a similar successful transformation 10 years ago that lead to accelerating revenue growth and free cash flow generation.

Maybe I’m being pollyannish about the situation, but I believe when SATS brings its Jupiter 3 satellite online next year, and is capable of delivering the same speeds as Starlink, churn will not only slow, but subscriber counts should begin to rebound. SATS will never be competitive with respect to latency, but that doesn’t keep me up at night. That’s not to discount the draw of low latency, which is important for use cases such as video conferencing and gaming, but when your target customer base is scraping by with max speeds of just 25 Mbps, the prospect of 100 Mbps should be highly attractive.

It's evolved from a 12-company index weighted heavily toward industrial businesses in the late 1800s to one that's now made up of 30 diverse, time-tested, multinational companies."", ""The long-term success of the Dow's components has been quite the lure for investors. It just so happens that everyday investors have access to the portfolios of Wall Street's brightest minds to see what they've been up to."", ""Every quarter, money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a detailed snapshot of what top-tier asset managers bought and sold in the latest three-month period. Despite the drawback of not getting this under-the-hood look until 45 days following the end of a quarter, 13Fs still provide invaluable insight into the stocks, industries, and trends capturing the attention of Wall Street's most successful investors."", 'The latest round of 13Fs (filed on Feb. 14) was particularly significant for three Dow Jones Industrial Average components. Whereas billionaire investors absolutely piled into two outperforming Dow stocks, 13F filings also show one Dow constituent was sent to the chopping block.', ""The first Dow component that really caught the attention of billionaire money managers during the quarter ending in December was theme-park operator and media giant Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). Five prominent billionaires added to their respective funds' stakes, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):"", 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (6,340,344 shares)', 'Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,100,700 shares)', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (563,685 shares)', 'Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (309,376 shares)', ""The lure of the House of Mouse for these billionaires looks to be some combination of improved operating performance and Disney's unmatchable intangibles."", ""With regard to the former, Disney's management team has stuck by its previous forecast that the company's streaming segment will reach profitability by the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year (ending in late September 2024). Following years of sizable operating losses from its streaming segment, Disney has expanded its direct-to-consumer offerings to include an ad-inclusive tier, and it hasn't been afraid to raise its prices."", ""I'll also add that Disney is seeing incremental growth from its theme-park and entertainment divisions as we move further away from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Let's not forget that China is only a little over a year removed from abandoning its stringent COVID-19 mitigation measures."", ""The other big-time catalyst for Walt Disney is the uniqueness of its brand. There isn't another media company that has the depth of characters or storytelling that Disney brings to the table. Few businesses can so easily cross generational gaps with their products and services."", ""Having a strong brand affords the company exceptional pricing power. Admission prices for Disneyland in Southern California have outpaced the prevailing rate of inflation in the U.S. by a factor of 10 since 1955. It's also why Disney can comfortably increase streaming prices without the fear of driving away too many of its subscribers."", 'The second Dow stock that billionaires were seemingly tripping over themselves to buy during the fourth quarter was e-commerce company Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The recently added Dow component had eight billionaire investors mashing the buy button, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares)', 'Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares)', 'Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares)', 'Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares)', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares)', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)', 'Although Amazon is best known for its world-leading e-commerce marketplace, online retail sales produce menial margins and little in the way of operating cash flow or income. Chances are that billionaires piled into Amazon because of the robust growth of its ancillary segments.', ""No operating division is more important to Amazon than its cloud infrastructure service platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS accounts for close to one-third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, based on estimates from tech market analyst Canalys. Despite accounting for only one-sixth of the company's net sales, the high margins associated with cloud services have helped AWS consistently generate 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income."", ""Amazon's advertising and subscription services are fast-growing segments, too. In April 2021, then-CEO Jeff Bezos noted that his company had surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers. This figure has likely risen given that Amazon is now the exclusive streaming provider of Thursday Night Football."", 'Finally, Amazon is a logical beneficiary of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. For example, generative AI solutions within AWS can be used by merchants to tailor messages to potential buyers. As long as AI remains a red-hot investment trend, Amazon is likely to benefit and draw the attention of billionaire money managers.', 'However, not every Dow Jones Industrial Average stock was embraced by billionaires in Q4. One widely owned stock that found itself on the chopping block was telecom titan\xa0Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). Seven successful billionaires were sellers, including (total shares sold in parentheses):', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (3,314,607 shares)', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (2,830,060 shares)', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,106,623 shares)', 'Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,844,350 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,458,200 shares)', 'Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (834,522 shares)', 'The reason prominent billionaires dumped Verizon in droves likely had to do with a July report from The Wall Street Journal that alleged legacy telecom companies could face sizable environmental and health-related liability costs tied to their use of lead-sheathed cables. Generally speaking, Wall Street loathes uncertainty.', ""The Federal Reserve's historic interest rate-hiking cycle was another possible sell catalyst for billionaire asset managers. Legacy telecom companies are carrying quite a bit of debt on their balance sheets. The nation's central bank increasing the federal funds rate by 525 basis points in less than two years could make future refinancing and borrowing costlier."", ""Verizon is also a mature business that's set to grow by a low-single-digit rate for the foreseeable future. With AI stocks soaring, active funds have likely been reallocating capital to faster-growing companies with more robust long-term expansion outlooks."", 'But in spite of this selling pressure, Verizon and its 6.7% yield still look like a bargain. Upgrading its network to handle 5G download speeds has increased wireless data consumption and is prompting a wave of broadband additions.', 'Furthermore, Verizon has made it clear that lead-clad cables play only a small role in its network.

We're investing more than $100 million a year in R&D and AI to bring users and advertisers the same amazing experience they have when they interact with search and social platforms every day, we're getting closer to the size of X, Pinterest, Snap and others in revenue and ad spend. And we're paving our way to becoming the very first must-buy platform for the open web.As I reflect on our journey. 10 years ago, we generated just over $200 million in revenue. I remember it like it was yesterday and this year, 10 years later, we're approaching $2 billion.Now looking ahead, I see two key themes that will allow us to achieve our financial transformation in 2024. The first one is reaching and engaging users in the open web with the addition of Yahoo. And now another iconic consumer brand, there's a lot of momentum here.Second one is how well we can monetize our time with consumers, specifically growth in performance advertising and AI to drive yield.Now let's expand into both of these areas, starting with how we reach users on the open web. We're seeing great momentum of publishers choosing to build on the back of our technology investments. We're so much more than just money to publishers as we empower the entire publisher organization, the editorial team, subscription team.Audience team monetization team and more publisher win rates continue to improve with terrific new publisher partners joining to build a family from all around the globe, including a three 60 media posts media times Internet, not entertainment and more.We renewed and expanded our scope with existing publishers, including NBC News, McClatchy editorial, Globo, Prisa winery and more in the industry. We're seeing a shift of great consumer companies getting into advertising in a bigger way.This includes Disney, Amazon, Netflix, DoorDash over Walmart and more or to some advertising is already one of the most profitable lines of business they have. I expect that Fortune 500 CEOs will increasingly be asked to present their advertising strategy and that the advertising industry will get to become a trillion dollar market in years to come. This is just the beginning.Now why I believe many of these companies were tried to sell directly to big brands. Many would consider partnering with a technology company like tubular to reach tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of mid-funnel performance advertisers.We have an opportunity to become the advertising engine of choice to the open web we collect advertising in a box, signing strategic partnerships with publishers and big consumer platforms, giftable another way to reach users and access new premium advertisers.And we're seeing it already with Yahoo. As incredible brands are starting to spend. And these are the best of the best out there. Names like Samsung and Verizon, Hulu, Hilton Hotels, Southwest Airlines, Citibank and many others on the other front.I can tell you we just had an executive off-site for the our leadership and we're focused on executing our plans this year and into 2025 our biggest priority is demand migration of Yahoo. Omnichannel advertisers. I'm happy to tell you we're seeing good results. And we recently shared the case study of large advertisers saying three times in lead volume at 24% lower cost?Sure. Some of you have a good progress. We expect Q1 revenue to cross the $100 million in revenue, which is fast ramping beyond working with publishers. We also reach users as part of the news as we bring our publishers content to Android devices.Popular news had a spectacular year in 2023 with revenue growing to over $100 million. It is still in early stages with a lot of work ahead of us yet. We expect another strong year for Timberland use in 2024. This is because device manufacturers all around the world continue to seek differentiated offerings to delight users with personalized experiences beyond publishers. Until the news, we're also reaching users with our header bidder.We're continuing to take advantage of our direct demand, unique data and AI to build an inventory that is not exclusively ours. Microsoft continues to be our largest beta partner, and we expect to expand our scope across our network of publishers in 2024.Microsoft made some changes to its Epic platform in Q4 that impacted all ad tech partners they work with, including us this had a single digit millions of dollars impact in Q4 and a small impact to 2024, which is already included in our guidance.Now switching to the second driver of revenue growth, how we monetize time with consumers, essentially how we grow yield yield represents the revenue we can generate per user for comparison, we estimate meta mix $200 of revenue per user a year in the US Snap next $33, and we make about three to $4 per user a year?Well, I think people as among the best in the Open Web, when it comes to monetizing user attention, you can imagine how much runway we have to improve and how much better the open web can do when we win the open web win.Now the Open Web is about $80 billion market because it uses low yield monetization capabilities invented 30 years ago, such as display banners, text ads, interstitials and more. And on top of that, only in the open web advertisers are asked to bid using CPC or CPM, which companies like Google or meta don't do another three ways to build will grow yield.First one is data. This is where current page being bigger and getting a large volume of clicks from the network makes us better at driving conversions to advertisers faster.The second one is AI. Deep learning is really hard to do. We've been added for years and this is a key element as it relates to matchmaking between users to information. And the third one is advertisers. We have 15 to 20,000 advertisers as of now, while Google and meta have 10 million advertisers each bringing more advertisers mean better diversity and personalization to offer users the ad they may like we're seeing great momentum from Actimize conversions.bOur advanced AI bidding technology, advertisers are seeing up to 50% boost in conversions while maintaining their cost per acquisition or CPA, as well as some advertisers are seeing reduced CPA by nearly 20%. Let's give an example.If you sold 10 flower bouquets with Taboola and it cost you $30 to get a single customer, you can now sell the same 10 bouquets at a cost of $24 per customer or sell up to 15 bouquets at the same $30 cost to acquire that customer. Now that's selling a lot more flowers and saving more, which is great. Now as more advertisers adopt our AI.And MAX conversions, we expect improved retentions essentially lower churns as well as increase in net dollar retention and DRs, which means advertisers are able to spend more with us over time.In Q4, we launched generated AI ad maker, helping advertisers kickoff campaign faster for self-service advertisers. One in four new creative are being generated using our new generation of AI in 2024, we're focused on enhancing our data integration with Yahoo.Continuing adoption and improvement to maximize conversions as well as launching a new maximize rollout optimization product called maximize revenue. Maximized revenue is a way for advertisers that have direct value associated with conversions like in the e-commerce space to optimize their desired return on investments.I'm happy to say that with this momentum, we're already 50% of our revenue is driven by advertisers who adopted MAX conversions and our exciting roadmap were back to yield growth this year. Another segment of advertisers that is helping us drive yield growth and seeing momentum is e-commerce.In 2023. We've benefited from the combined firepower of Connexity scheme links and Timberland. We launched turnkey commerce, which is where we partner with publishers to establish or expand their eCommerce business.This is in high demand. We essentially create eCommerce content, drive traffic to it and monetize it all powered by Taboola. I'm very, very happy to say that at the end of 2023 we signed an agreement with the Associated Press one of the largest and most trusted news.Publishers in the world to power its new e-commerce destination using Taboola turnkey content. E-commerce represents approximately 20% of X-Tack its premium revenue. And we continue to see it as an important growth driver for Taboola in years to come.Now, as I'm wrapping up my part I would be remiss in not acknowledging that our industry is facing tectonic changes this year that cookie deprecation, JNI and the need for performance advertising in times of recession and market softness and we are so ready.We have more current page than anyone. We understand intent with users clicking on Taboola tens of billions of times a year. And if history is a proxy for the future. We did well when Apple dedicated cookies.In summary, we're coming in strong into 2024 with extending partnerships, fast revenue growth and a strong EBITDA and free cash flow profile. We're announcing a new $100 million buyback authorization. And after two years, if you had been soft, we're back to growth as our clients adopt AI faster than any product developed since I started to work.With that, I'll pass the call over to Steve to review our financials and outlook in more detail."", 'Stephen Walker', ""Thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. As Adam mentioned, we had a strong end to 2023. Our Q4 revenues were approximately $420 million and grew 13% year over year, accelerating from Q3 levels. X-tack gross profit was $169 million, which represented growth of 6% year over year.X-tack growth was driven by double digit growth in advertising spend and included a small contribution from Yahoo in the quarter. These positive factors were partially offset by margin compression due to the ad rate declines in 2022, which have since stabilized in 2023.Net income was $3.7 million and non-GAAP net income was $31.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $50.1 million, representing a 30% adjusted EBITDA margin year over year. Adjusted EBITDA was down, which was due primarily to higher expenses related to the onboarding of Yahoo.Supply that were not in the year-ago period. Operating expenses, excluding Yahoo, would have been relatively flat year over year, reflecting strong cost discipline in 2023, which we plan to continue into 2024. For the full year of 2023, we finished with over $1.4 billion in revenue, $536 million in X-Tack gross profit and $99 million in adjusted EBITDA, we had a net loss of $82 million and non-GAAP net income of $33 million.We also generated $52 million of free cash flow in 2023, which was up 181% versus 2022. Free cash flow benefited from the stronger than forecasted adjusted EBITDA, which reflects the cost controls mentioned previously, partially offset by the expenses related to the onboarding of Yahoo.Inventory in the period. Free cash flow in Q4 would have been even stronger, if not for the timing of some payables and capital expenditures that we mentioned were delayed last quarter. As Adam said, our strong revenue and X-Tack gross profit performance was driven by strength in our e-commerce, video and tubular news businesses as well as the initial contributions from Yahoo and relatively stable yields in our core business.E-commerce had double digit growth in 2023, driven by strong growth in advertising budgets from some of our largest retail advertisers as well as strong momentum in Europe. In addition, we are seeing great success ramping to boost speeds and now Yahoo.As supply sources for our retail advertisers. In fact, to bullet speed supply hasn't become a top 10 traffic source globally for these advertisers. As we have stated previously to bullet news grew very quickly and exceeded $100 million in revenues in 2023. In total, e-commerce Taboola news and header bidding now represent approximately 30% of our XTAC. gross profit.This is exciting because each represents very valuable forms of supply that are valued by high quality advertisers. Our team, our teams have achieved accelerating revenue and X-Tack performance while improving cost efficiency indicated by our strong adjusted EBITDA margin.Exiting 2023, operating expenses were $489 million in 2023, up $11 million year over year as a result of the costs incurred to onboard the significant inventory we are gaining with the addition of Yahoo. Excluding Yahoo.As I mentioned earlier, operating expenses were essentially flat with the prior year. Our headcount is down approximately 2.5% from its peak in July of 2022, with our ongoing expense discipline and our strong growth expectations. We expect that in 2024, we will approach our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 30%.GAAP net loss for 2023 of $82 million included amortization of intangibles of $63.9 million, share-based compensation expenses of $53.7 million and hold back compensation expenses related to the Connexity acquisition of $10.6 million, all of which were excluded from non-GAAP net income. Our non-GAAP net income of $32.6 million was above the high end of our guidance range.In terms of cash generation, we had approximately $84.4 million in operating cash flow in 2023 and free cash flow of $52.2 million. This includes net publisher prepayments, which were a source of cash of $19.7 million and interest payments on our long-term debt, which were a use of cash of $18.5 million.As I have highlighted in previous quarters, I would note that net publisher prepayments were a source of cash for the full year due to the fact that new prepayments were lower than the amortization of historical prepayment.Let's turn to the balance sheet. You can see that our net cash balance remains healthy. Our net cash position of $36.2 million remained positive at the end of Q4, even after share repurchases, cash and cash equivalents, plus our short-term investments decreased from $250.7 million at the end of Q3 to $181.8 million at the end of Q4.This reflected a $50 million prepayment of our debt and $32 million used for share buyback activity in Q4, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments remained above our debt principal balance of $142.2 million.Speaking of our share repurchases, I would also like to provide an update on our share buyback and debt repayment programs. The share buyback program was initiated on June 1. And as of December 30th, we had repurchased over 15 million shares at an average price of $3.62 for a total repurchases of $55.1 million.The average repurchase price of $3.62 represented a return of approximately 30% based on our closing price on Monday, today, we are also announcing a new share buyback authorization of $100 million that replaces our former buyback plan, which was largely exhausted.We are fortunate enough to be able to fund our organic growth investments from our operating cash flow. Given that we believe that at current valuations, the best use of our free cash flow is to buy back shares to the extent that we have additional cash to deploy, we intend to pay down our long-term debt. We did this in October of 2023.In fact, when we voluntarily prepaid, another $50 million of our long-term debt, bringing the total debt that we have voluntarily prepaid to $141 million. As always, both the share repurchase program and the debt paydown are contingent upon the availability of sufficient working capital as an Israeli company, we are also required to obtain Israeli court approval for share repurchases.Also of note we will be filing a general purpose shelf in the coming days. We consider a good corporate hygiene for our company at our stage to have a general-purpose shelf on file given we believe our stock is a great value at current levels and have announced a new buyback authorization today. We obviously do not intend to issue new shares at this time.I just wanted to make that make sure that was clear. Now let me shift to our forward looking guidance. As Adam mentioned earlier, in this last 12 months, we invested in technology that advanced our e-commerce and tubular news offerings successfully launched maximized conversions and onboarded all of Yahoo's global native supply.Onto the two bullet network, 2023 was a year in which we invested heavily in these initiatives, sometimes in the advance in advance of revenue.As we look ahead, we see the following tailwinds driving outsized growth in our business through 2025. First, we expect the Yahoo by advertiser migration to be materially complete by Q3 2024 and to continue ramping into 2025. Second, we expect yield growth to turn positive in 2020.For third, we expect a phased onboarding of the supply from our new iconic consumer brand partner in 2024 and 2025 and lastly, we expect further yield gains over time as the volume of our contextual data increases with the addition of Yahoo and other supply to our network, which will further enhance yield as a result.We are initiating guidance for 2024 that includes strong top line growth and improving profitability. We expect revenue of $1.89 billion to $1.94 billion, which represents growth of 33% at the midpoint, we expect gross profit of $535 million to $555 million and X-Tack gross profit of $656 million to $679 million. That ex tax is up roughly 25% year over year.At the midpoint, we are reiterating our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance of over $200 million and free cash flow expectation of over $100 million. I will note that the adjusted EBITDA guidance represents a doubling of that metric versus 2023.Finally, we are expecting non-GAAP net income of $84 million to $104 million in 2024 we continue to be very excited by the addition of Yahoo. To our business. Adam mentioned earlier, we feel good about the progress with Yahoo, and we expect revenue on Yahoo. To exceed $100 million in Q1 for competitive purposes.And due to the fact that Yahoo supply has been fully integrated into our broader publisher network, we will treat disclosures around Yahoo. Similarly to how we treat other major publishers on our network on a going-forward basis.Finally, we are introducing Q1 2024 guidance. This quarter, we expect revenues of $387 million to $413 million, gross profit of $94 million to $106 million. X-tack gross profit of $123 million to $135 million, adjusted EBITDA of $10 million to $17 million and non-GAAP net income of negative $15 million to negative $3 million.Let me finish by saying that we are happy with our fourth quarter performance and excited about the step change growth that we are expecting in our business in 2024.For the growth investments, we have made in 2023. The additional scale that Yahoo is bringing and the additional supply we will be onboarding as part of a new partnership with an iconic consumer brand is accelerating our journey towards becoming a must-buy for advertisers looking to reach consumers in the open web.With that, let me pass it back to Adam for some closing remarks."", 'Adam Singolda', ""Thanks, Steve. I've never been more bullish about tubular, and I'm so proud of our people, our dedication, passion, making us a high performing company through the most difficult of times. We're coming strong into 2024, making it a record year for us.Revenues growing 33% to $2 billion. X-tack is growing 25% to nearly $670 million EBITDA is doubling to over $200 million. Free cash flow is nearly doubling to over $100 million. And on the back of these numbers, we're announcing an authorization of $100 million of buyback, essentially looking to buy 6% of our Company.As I mentioned, our industry is changing and with companies like Netflix and Disney, Uber, DoorDash Amazon and more expanding their advertising initiatives. I suspect we are the beginning of an exciting add menu, but as a chance of becoming the partner of choice to many of them.As I said at the beginning of our call, in addition to Yahoo, I'm incredibly excited to have just signed another iconic consumer brand that validates two bullets advertising in a box value proposition. Our vision is to become the recommendation engine for the open web and build the very first multi-billion dollar gateway for advertisers to reach publishers.OEMs and apps outside of walled gardens today. It's a good day for us. I'm excited to get 2024 going. So everyone, thank you for being part of our journey. And with that, let's open it up to questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', 'Thank you. (Operator Instructions)Andrew Boone, JMP Securities. Your line is open.', 'Andrew Boone', 'Credit Thanks so much for taking my questions. Adam, as we think about yield improvements in 2024 and the inflection that you guys are expecting, can you just help us understand what the key drivers are as well as what are the products that are your key priorities in terms of improving yield over the next year?And then I want to step back and talk about a big picture question for Yahoo. And Paula, if I go back and I think about 2022 pro forma revenue of kind of that $2.5 billion of gross revenue. Is that still on the table? Or is that still kind of the roadmap as we think about maybe 2025? Or what are the puts and takes as we think about kind of that benchmark? And thanks so much, guys.', 'Adam Singolda', ""Sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question and good morning, everyone. So on the yield front, there's a lot of going on. As you know, it's our number one investment as a company because we think this drive the most amount of value to our clients, our partners and to stimulate sales in a competitive way as we're adopting and going after new business.So let me just dive in into that 2024. We're starting strong lead conversion already of course, in the 60% adoption.As a quick reminder, next MX conversion is kind of our AI that allows clients and advertisers to work with us in a similar way to how they work with Google and Facebook, where they don't have to tell us what is the CPC. to win a bid or what are the CPMs and looking to to buy.They just to give us their budgets at times they give us your target for what is worth what it would have declined fourth and redo the rest. It's the fastest adopted product has started to bottom, and it's really fantastic.We're seeing great case studies not only from towards advertisers now also with Yelp advertisers migrating to the wireless technology and republishing those case studies because we're seeing advertisers that essentially either or able to spend more on new advertisers that are churning less and did a really good metrics for us to follow again in our flower examples on my letter.But essentially, just from a numbers perspective, we're essentially seeing up to 50%, 50% boost in the amount of conversion at the same price. And in other times, we're seeing the same amount of conversions, but the price is being reduced by 20%.These are serious numbers and also just from the client's perspective, the experience they have working with us, it's so much simpler and more easy to do when they have to do with the ad tech industry, which which I would argue one of the Achilles' heel of the ad tech industry is that we're still working with advertisers the way we used to work 30 years ago.Whereby everyone around us are mainly platforms. Walled gardens has evolved to unionize. So I want by the end of this year, the vast majority of this business, as you know, approaching $2 billion to be using AINCPCCPN. to be a kind of a story from the past that what's coming next for us. I'm going to launch in H. two max revenue.This is on top of next conversion. It's another sophisticated AI bidding strategy, allowing clients that know what is the price associated with a purchase to give us that margin and revenue goals they have and we optimize for that. This is going to launch in the second half of the year, which will be additive to next conversion.Gen-i is continuing to get great adoption by self service. As you know, I love self service. This is an opportunity to get kind of introduced to great new clients that a lot of times, they come small, but they potentially become big and one in every four creative titles and some mills.And these are selling open out there now already the industry's talking about video creation. So who knows where that goes, but 24 credit bridges with Gemini. And so that's been great. E-commerce is another source of bolstering our yield in 2024 you may have seen that I mentioned in the letter that Associated Press just chose to go to margin e-commerce business.You all know, time.com and you know, advanced. I'm also working in e-commerce with turnkey and now AP. That was a new announcement today. And all of that is helping us to essentially attract new retailers and improve our basic basically weighted average yield across the network.Then you add data integration. We're looking to expand our contextual data segments with Yahoo. That's something that I'm very excited about, especially on the back of kind of H. two cookie deprecation. So that's also going to compound our ability to drive yield.And last but not least, more advertisers. So we're migrating advertisers from now. We expect that to the fully complete in two three. And these are the best the crème de la crème, best of the best you see others, Samsung and Citi and Verizon.These are fantastic kind of enterprise advertisers, all of those things from the technology side, the data side and the client side, our compounding our yield expansion. And you mentioned also and I mentioned it on earlier my on my remarks that after three years of kind of softness in yield that, you know, all of us have experience in this industry to Villa.We kind of assume that if nothing happens in the market, we will do better than the market. So we assume that the yield is back to growth in 2024. It's in our budget in our guidance. So we expect this initiative to two come to fruition."", 'Stephen Walker', ""And then to your second question, about a $1 billion opportunity with Yahoo. The simple answer on that is yes, we still believe there's more than $1 billion of value in that partnership is by the way, we did say that we expect to see $100 million in revenue from the supply in Q1.So that's encouraging. That's a good step towards that. Advertisers will be fully migrated only in Q3. So that's also key to capturing the base value of the partnership. And then from there, what we expect is that the revenue will continue to grow as we capture synergies to get us to the full $1 billion value. So yes, at least, yes, we expect that it will happen over time."", 'Andrew Boone', 'Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you.Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer. Your line is open for everybody.', 'Jason Helfstein', ""Just some clarification and then a question. So just to be clear. So the $100 million in Yahoo. That's not cumulative that's like for first quarter, correct?"", 'Adam Singolda', ""Correct. That's $100 million on the on new supply, in my view changes."", 'Jason Helfstein', ""And then you said the fourth quarter obviously was a meaningfully below that. You're not giving a number. And but we have to guess just repeat the language, you said how much it was like the way you described in the fourth quarter when?"", 'Adam Singolda', 'We said low tens of millions.', 'Jason Helfstein', ""Okay. So I mean, like zero kind of hit the elephant in the room here. I mean, you play around with the math that means it like the kind of and actually Yahoo. The business is accelerating, but like that's not really fair, right, because at the end of the day, you have a certain amount of advertiser demand.There's different publishing sources, different yields you're trying to get. So just how should we all look, we're going to all kind of play with math over the next year to look at the kind of the with and without Yahoo. Impact, like how are you thinking about that?Because, you know, I don't think you're describing the businesses like slowing down. So just how do you think about like the puts and takes around bringing that inventory and kind of like the yields you get out of that versus other inventory Emily, like should we be doing that math on the growth ex Yahoo? And then just one quick follow-up on identity and cookies."", 'Stephen Walker', ""Okay. So I'll take that first question, and it's a good question. So first of all, we're growing nearly $500 million in top line revenue this year. So 30%, 33% year over year. So obviously strong growth a good chunk of it is Yahoo, but not all of it as you observed. The complexity of that is that Yahoo. Comes with both supply and advertiser demand.Some in the $100 million that we just talked about. That is q. one, and that's revenue on the Yahoo. Supply. And but it's a mix of tool advertisers and Yahoo advertisers. So where the top line growth comes from over time is also migrating the Yahoo advertisers over and growing our overall advertiser base.Thanks to this really great high-quality supply we have. So in order to get full growth, we need to go there. That's Wave one and we expect to have the advertisers migrated by Q3. And then, as I mentioned before, in answer to Andrew's question, then Wave two is to start to grow the synergies to get to the full $1 billion of value.So you are correct that it's not as simple as you know, you just bring over the supply and you're done, we have bring over the advertisers. And so it's more complex. So so that's kind of the way to think about it. And you're right, our core business is still growing. It's just that Yahoo. Will take time to get to the full ramp."", 'Jason Helfstein', ""And then just on identity, you've talked in the past that you're not dependent on cookies. And so folks should be less concerned about kind of where we go from here. However, there is going to be more identity metrics that obviously you're going to be adopted and come into the market on third third-party metrics. Can you use those metrics to drive kind of even more yield, even though you don't need to use identity theft?"", 'Adam Singolda', ""Yes, I think I will take there. I think about it is from from a downside protection in terms of risk that companies might have, we believe the risk is mitigated for two reasons. One, we have the best when Apple definitely dedicated to cookies in 2020.And we did we did well, in fact, have actually accelerated yield so that's good. And the second thing is that we have a large amount of first-party cookies today as we store. We reach 600 million people a day and people to click on a couple of tens of billions of times. So we think we have a good a good kind of setup for cookie deprecation.So from the way, I think about it is we can do well and potentially even grow because again, in the past, other demand came to us when it couldn't find other channels. And we were a good channel to spend money on if there are if there's anything in the market that can accelerate that even further, we'll take it. I just don't personally, I feel comfortable because we don't need any new solution to do well.I think we have written what we need to cross that bridge successfully to our publishers and advertisers. And again, just as a reminder, the vast majority, about 90% of our revenue comes from clients who buy from the biller direct Fanatics, no new agencies, which means that we have pixels on their pages.So when someone moves from our publishers to their pages. We know we drove that conversion. So that's why we don't use third-party cookies to demonstrate value to clients as they buy from us and this is a fundamental point there is that there is potentially even further upside to yield, but the downside is mitigated."", 'Jason Helfstein', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. One moment for the next question no.Laura Martin, Needham & Company. Your line is open.', 'Laura Martin', ""And it's good morning again. My first one is on political. So globally, there's a really strong election cycle going on in 2024. And can you remind us how that impacts your impression growth in your readership and how that flows through to revenue in a political year appraisal. And I'll ask my second one.Actually, that's alone."", 'Adam Singolda', ""Good morning, and thanks for the question. Hey, it's up. So we know what we're thinking about historically we did see some bumpiness in kind of demand coming on political season, but especially from video with some more kind of interest video demand in our guidance.And we kind of like manage the business, we don't assume that it's coming. So we kind of want to be conservative in terms of what might happen. There's also potential acceleration in traffic because there's more viewership and things of that nature.Again, we don't assume those things as a material kind of a financial benefit to us. But it historically we did see some nice bumps but again, nothing too significant that we would like to sort of embed in our planning."", 'Laura Martin', ""Okay. So that's an upside driver. It's not in the numbers, it's helpful. And by the way, they're talking about $17 billion of spending in the US alone. We think it might be a bigger political year that people when the near historical uplift during the second question I had for you, Adam, is I'm really curious, as you bring over these new types of advertisers that too bullish never had with YahooLike Verizon and these big enterprise high-quality branding customers. Does that a I'm really interested in what kinds of challenges or what kinds of things they need that your historical advertisers have not? And secondly, does it give you a new new product idea when you think about the product roadmap, are there things these types of advertisers are asking for that could sort of if things develop them could really forever accelerate that trajectory of revenue growth optical, that's your point of view on that."", 'Adam Singolda', ""Yes, this is such a good question because we obviously this is a very new type of segments of clients that get introduced to boot up. Most of it right now is on the outside, right? Like we're filling that incredible kind of publisher with a mix of people and advertisers. But what we're seeing is, first of all, they really appreciate the technologies we can bring to the table.So they're adopting MAX conversion into our pixels. And these are new things to them, and it allows us and our account managers to and I think a lot of account managers almost daily to see the graph and to see the trends.And these are really good trends, both in terms of increase of budgets and performance as it relates to conversion rates and CPA. So it's early days. I know it's only $1 million. So it's still early days, but I'm seeing really good things and they're very happy. So these clients want to spend time with us and the IR team and this is all good beginning where.I think it's going is this potentially will allow us to develop new formats and kind of new experiences that those clients are used to getting either historically from Yahoo or on other channels, I think that might open up a whole new way. Users would experience sponsored content and ads on its women network as well as in Yahoo over time.So I would say stay tuned for a potential U.S. innovation in formats and experiences that those brand advertisers are looking for that we are yet to offer so I do think they might make us even better those clients.And we're trying to, you know, we're trying to be humble and we're learning, we're asking questions and we're spending time with them. But I'm excited mainly by the performance. That's the most important thing.But I but I'm I'm sensing they would like us to further develop the way we present ADS on the open web. And that might affect not only our relationship with young, but rather how we render ads across our entire network of Disney and NBC and the rest of our great partners."", 'Laura Martin', 'Thanks very much.', 'Operator', 'James Kopelman, TD Cowen. Your line is open.', 'James Kopelman', 'Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one is for Adam. In the letter you referenced the amount of contextual data that TiVo has for AI and deep learning. Can you talk about how you view bullish growing data set as a differentiator when it comes to training AI and leveraging generative NI over time? And then I have a follow-up for Steve Yes.', 'Adam Singolda', ""And so as it relates to just the amount of data we have, I think the most important thing and I can I speak a lot about becoming the must buy for the open web. And what I mean by that is it's a matter of how big is your actually gross revenue and your spend because this is a good proxy for how relying advertisers become a new because we're big enough that it's worth their time to spend money with you.Because again, I think today the ad tech industry is a bit fragmented or to fragment for for advertisers to rely on you. And I'm looking at companies like Snapchat and Pinterest and X, it's in a $2 billion to $4 billion range. And now we're getting into that range. So I think first of all, the most important thing to become a must-buy is growing revenue and become, you know, get that flywheel going.So that advertisers want to work with you and it's what's our time to the footprint. We have an accordion payable, as I would argue, is probably the largest in the opening level in the world. I don't know of any company that has a first-party relationship with publishers like double that at our size.Which really gives us first party access to everything that takes place on the page from contact to scoring to clicks to purchase assets or things of that nature. And I think that's growing exponentially, obviously with Yahoo. So this is this is done.I think one of the most important assets the Company has, which is covered on page exclusively for long term. And this is what gives us also predictability as a business to know that we don't expect any big shift one way or the other.And then as we look into January, I think it's important to kind of reference what exactly is JI. Jenny, I can do to the market. Jni adventure is going to be a technology that is available to everyone what's going to make a difference from one company to the other is really the amount of data and the type of data you can prompt into the engine so you can get a better outcome. So as an example, when an advertiser comes to bill them and said, suggests some nails and titles.For me, we are able to say, well, we've seen, let's say, let's take an example, an insurance client comfortable level to say, we've seen a $1 billion of insurance spend over the last few years, and we can pump that into the engine. And then we're getting really great kind of authenticating a authentic, a new original titles and Samuels we can suggest to the clients.So I think what makes us special here is the amount of data we have our size and this is also why I love the our partnership. And as I mentioned in the letter, there's another iconic consumer brand that is signed and starting to have with us all of those will give us more data to come into the Gen-i.And we have a senior person leading Jenny, I will announce and I can tell you we're working on very exciting things because I believe that the biggest opportunity JNI has to the advertising industry is to simplify the experience of buying it today is that it's very, very complicated to succeed I think, Jenny, I can make it really simple. So I'm so what's to come is our unique data into JNI, introducing special creatives that others don't have."", 'James Kopelman', ""And then for Steve high level, how should we think about the seasonality of growth of both gross revenue and expense in 2024, given the various moving parts around Yahoo. As a new unnamed publishing partner and your typical historical seasonality?And then finally, just wanted to ask about OpEx efficiencies. What are some of the ways that you're able to limit head count increases this year, even as you scale?Yes."", 'Stephen Walker', ""So in terms of the seasonality, so Yahoo is like a very large publisher in our traditional core business. So I think their seasonality is very similar to our historical pre Connexity seasonality. So that's so the way to think about adding them to our network as a company.As you know, we've become more and more fourth quarter dominated because of our e-commerce business in particular. And this year, obviously, with the bringing on Yahoo over the course of the year, will be more back-half loaded than usual as well.But generally, the way to think of seasonality with Yahoo is it's like a large publisher and they have very similar seasonality to other large publishers and they're number one or number two in news sports finance, and that is pretty much what the kind of core of our base is. So that's a way to think about seasonality in terms of OpEx and how we control headcount here?Yes, I think we've shown pretty good cost discipline over the course of the last year. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our OpEx for Q4 and in fact, for all of 2023 would have been flat year over year, except for the hiring that we did for Yahoo.To support that, I would expect that our fourth quarter OpEx base, it's probably going to be similar to what it is the rest of this year. There may be a slight increase as a result of some additional hiring that we have to do for Yahoo.But we're really working on kind of keeping a lid on costs and the way we do that as we find efficiencies and we find ways to leverage the people we have to do more. Frankly, we're using generative AI and other AI tools internally now to generate productivity and to improve things.So for and a great example of that is exactly what Adam talked about. Historically, our account managers who support our advertisers used to spend a lot of time helping the advertiser figure out like what's a good headline, what's a good creative or image for this.And now we have generative AI tools that help them do. It can generate a dozen of them instantly whereas they used to take a lot of thought and a lot of time to come up with a dozen. So it's not it's all about productivity, finding ways to leverage our people across more accounts. I think we're doing a pretty good job on that."", 'James Kopelman', 'Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate all the color.', 'Adam Singolda', 'Thanks, James.', 'Operator', 'Thank you.Daniel Day, B. Riley securities. Your line is open.', 'Daniel Day', ""Yes, morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions on. So this iconic consumer brand that you've mentioned here and possible to say whether a traditional Open Web publisher that you typically partner with, but maybe on a bigger scale.So do you feel like it's worth specifically calling out or and maybe like a new type of partner and thinking something like a retail media network or a company may be new to the advertising business or something along those lines? And then if there's any prepayment or anything else that could impact cash flow associated with some with this publisher win?Yes."", 'Stephen Walker', ""And we can say the name, it's not a it's not a traditional publisher. So it's an iconic brand that have that signed rolling out with us. I don't think we can mention the name, but I hope we can mention that soon."", 'Daniel Day', ""Okay, great. So question, it seems like every week for since you last reported, we're hearing about layoffs at Open Web publishers. How much this industry is really struggling to survive for a lot of them and especially how they're struggling to generate traffic of search and social at anywhere near the levels they have in the past.So given you're in part dependent on them generating traffic to their properties. How do you think about that as a headwind and opportunity for you to help them through these struggles?"", 'Adam Singolda', 'Sorry, sorry, Daniel, I missed part of that question. Can you give to me again?Yes.Yes.', 'Daniel Day', ""Just generally like Open Web publishers struggling a lot of them going through layoffs, and I'm struggling to generate traffic to just how you think about your role as a as an ad tech partner here in helping them continue to generate traffic and what you can do there?"", 'Stephen Walker', ""Sure. So I can take this one. Several were on our network. We're not seeing any any material impact today. And I think also many of our publishers are enterprise big publishers that have a lot of direct traffic. So something to date, we haven't seen any material impact.And then also, I think this is an opportunity for us because the way we approach working with with publishers, it's really the most strategic level whereby you're able to use our homepage for you to drive home this personalization, we're able to use our e-commerce business to drive kind of diversification of revenue is subscription.And we have Metro EI. and to help them kind of personalize a page watches with lens on it. And I think if you're a publisher, especially, you know, if you're a senior person on the publisher side or Senior Product Manager, when you think about who do you want to work with just want to make sure that you can work with companies that can drive audience growth because you're concerned about that going down.You want to make sure we work with companies that can increase your engagement with consumers and then as well as collect your RPU or your lifetime value. So I think this is such an important differentiation we have I can tell you, I just had a call a week ago with a fairly big publisher and from the CEO and the CEO asked me, you know what a particular news or engagement is part of the deal.And I said, well, of course, and instead what we have to work for a long time because we can just to put people on and off and and the entire composition was about added value. It wasn't about CPM. It wasn't about you know, you've talked about guarantees.It wasn't much pressure. It was about other things. Publishers are thinking about so this is up to me such a fun part of my job as well as an exciting moment that publishers want to work with us because of the technology investments we made beyond just money."", 'Adam Singolda', ""So Daniel, just that certainly, it goes back to your first question about the iconic consumer brand. I checked with our PR folks, and we're allowed to say is we were selected by Apple as an official advertising partner for Canada and Australia at this point. So I think that's that's what we're allowed to say."", 'Daniel Day', ""Okay. Also that's good. To hear. Thanks, guys."", 'Operator', 'Thank you.Justin Patterson, KeyBanc. Your line is open.', 'Justin Patterson', ""Great. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to up-level the conversation a little bit around these bigger brands that are opening up like Yahoo originally and now Apple in there, it seems like this is just a new opportunity for to move power, a lot more of these bigger brands.I guess one just what's really changed around that? Was it just Yahoo. That opened U.S. dollar over the past year and then two, as you've gone through Yahoo. How should we think about just the incremental investment to support more of these brands and win more business and scale up over time."", 'Adam Singolda', ""Thank you. I'll start and you can do because I can't believe the CFO was able to bring the news about Apple than yesterday. And I know that, Steve, we're going to have to talk about this afterwards. But it's obviously we're very excited about apertures into this into this exciting market subject to your question.I think to me what's fascinating is that you can already see companies like Amazon and others speaking about advertising being the second or third line of EBITDA they have. So the trend is that advertising is going to become a trillion-dollar market.And I believe Board members of all Fortune 500 companies are going to Ester-C of what is our advertising strategy because it's too big and a few reach. Consumers cannot be ignored. Not only that to be a fantastic if not, what are the most lucrative growth engines for Fortune 500 companies are all around the world now.I think the way it's going to it's going to pan out is that many of these great companies would want to sell directly to the top of the market. We want to do. We'd like to build relationship with enterprise accounts. However, there are two things that are would be missing.One, it's unlikely you're going to sell to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands performance, mid-funnel and advertisers. And the second thing is that it's unlikely they'll develop a technology that is able to use AI and data and matchmaker between users and ads in a way that works for advertisers to continue to buy.And this is exactly, I think, portable and has an opportunity, which I'm very excited about. I mean, I never you never thought two years ago, we'll be in a position when we announced a $1 billion partnership with a great company like Yahoo.And now steel stole my thunder but now Apple chose to boom. And I think this potentially can become an opportunity for the Company to kind of be this engine for, call it advertiser in a box for all these companies that say, well, we should get $1 billion or more from the advertising space.So I'm excited about it. This is more than I ever thought will happen, but I do think it's a it's happening. And again, we're seeing exciting partnership with Pinterest with Yahoo. Netflix with Microsoft. This is really a whole new beginning, in my opinion, and I hope we can play a big, big part of it in terms of incremental upside."", 'Justin Patterson', 'No, go ahead. Sorry, Steve.', 'Stephen Walker', ""Yes, around in terms of incremental investment required to support these types of partnerships. I guess what I would say is the reason I think we're winning some of these great partnerships is because we have invested so much in our performance advertising capabilities and a young.And while I think we have a long ways to go, I still consider us in the early innings here in terms of being great, we are world-class at it. And I think that's what helps us win these partnerships. Obviously, every partnership we do of significant scale has some unique requirements, Yahoo.We're definitely learning from their ads average, Adam mentioned earlier, we're learning from their advertisers, things that they would like maybe they got some of it from Yahoo. Previously. Maybe there's new things. We're learning that week that they would like that.They never got from Yahoo, but we could do so, yes, you always invest something in terms of building capabilities for any large partnership, but it's all part of kind of our core business, like, as Adam said, we're learning from these advertisers, things that they want, we're investing in, and that will impact and positively impact all of our business, not just that partnership. So while there's investment, it's basically just a way to advance your business and it's true of all of these partnerships that we're signing."", 'Justin Patterson', ""Got it. Thank you. Both And for what it's worth, I mean you still profit under there."", 'Adam Singolda', 'Thank you. Thank you, sir. Appreciate that. And we still will still get a review after this session.I pass on.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may all disconnect.""]"

However, the numerous technological advancements over the past decade changed everything."", ""Cloud computing signaled a monumental shift from on-premise servers to data centers. Nvidia began pivoting its business by acquiring a data center networking business called Mellanox for $6.9 billion in 2019. The rise of cryptocurrencies further boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Bitcoin miners used GPUs like Nvidia's to power their mining rigs."", ""And, of course, the ever-rising interest in all things artificial intelligence (AI) in late 2022 began what investors see today. To Nvidia's credit, the company has been prepared for these tremendous shifts, whereas Nvidia's competition seemingly wasn't ready for it.

That's arguably a bargain for a company that analysts expect over 30% annualized earnings growth from over the long term:"", ""With that said, there are two potential problems here. First, Nvidia is dominating the AI chip market right now. Given the apparent gold rush of companies investing to build AI systems, Nvidia has a target on its back. Competitors will be trying to take share, and big technology companies are working on designing their own AI chips. Nvidia's long-term growth could depend heavily on how well it protects its market share."", ""Second, even assuming Nvidia lives up to long-term expectations, it's clear that at a $2 trillion market cap, the stock's best returns are comfortably in the past.

It's safe to say that the semiconductor bellwether passed with flying colors as the demand for its graphics cards and processors remains robust."", ""The stakes were high as Nvidia's shares have shot up an enormous 240% in the past year, so it needed to convincingly beat Wall Street's expectations and prove that AI is more than just hype.

What's more, the company's Q4 revenue accelerated at a faster pace than the 206% year-over-year jump it recorded in the fiscal third quarter, indicating that the demand for its chips is increasing. Meanwhile, the company's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings shot up a whopping 486% year over year to $5.16 per share."", ""Consensus estimates were anticipating Nvidia would deliver $4.60 per share in adjusted earnings on revenue of $20.4 billion. The company exceeded expectations by a mile. Also, the company's full-year revenue was up an impressive 126% year over year to $61 billion, while earnings shot up 288% to $12.96 per share. Nvidia witnessed a substantial jump in its non-GAAP gross margin to 73.8% last fiscal year as compared to 59.2% in fiscal 2023, which is a testament to the outstanding pricing power Nvidia enjoys in AI chips."", ""Even better, the company's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 suggests that its tremendous growth is here to stay. Nvidia anticipates $24 billion in revenue at the midpoint of its guidance range, which means that it expects its top line to more than triple from the prior-year period's figure of $7.2 billion. Wall Street would have been satisfied with fiscal Q1 revenue of $21.9 billion."", ""It predicts that the non-GAAP gross margin will land between 76.3% and 77%. That would be a big jump as compared to the year-ago period's reading of 66.8%, suggesting that Nvidia's bottom line is set for robust growth once again."", 'The reason why Nvidia is all set to sustain its stunning growth is simple -- the booming demand for its AI chips that are deployed in data centers. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang pointed out in the company\'s earnings release that ""accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point."" Third-party estimates indicate the same, with Future Market Insights predicting that the AI chip market could grow tenfold in revenue over the next decade and generate $287 billion in revenue in 2034.', ""Nvidia is already making the most of this opportunity. Its data center revenue shot up 409% year over year last quarter to $18.4 billion as the demand for its flagship H100 AI GPU (graphics processing unit) remained solid. For the full year, Nvidia's data center revenue reached a record $47.5 billion, an increase of 217% over the prior year. This segment produced 79% of the company's top line last year."", ""Based on Gartner's estimate that the AI chip market generated $53 billion in revenue last year, Nvidia's full-year data center revenue indicates that it controlled nearly 90% of this space in 2023. The research firm estimates that global AI chip revenue could hit almost $120 billion in 2027. Assuming Nvidia can maintain its dominance in this market -- which it seems capable of thanks to an aggressive product roadmap -- its data center revenue could increase to $108 billion in the next three years."", 'Throw in the other catalysts that Nvidia is sitting on, such as the adoption of generative AI in personal computers (PCs) that is fueling the growth of its gaming business, and it is easy to see why analysts have significantly raised their growth forecasts and are expecting it to sustain its elevated levels of growth going forward.', ""Analysts are forecasting Nvidia's revenue to increase 80% in fiscal 2025 to almost $110 billion, followed by further gains in the next two fiscal years."", ""Nvidia's revenue is expected to touch almost $150 billion in fiscal 2027.

Last year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared more than 40% thanks in large part to euphoria surrounding the AI narrative.', 'Specifically, the ""Magnificent Seven"" -- Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Nvidia -- have had a major influence on the record-setting performance by the S&P 500 so far in 2024.', 'But there are many opportunities beyond those seven. One company that has experienced quite a bit of volatility over the last year is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), which works extremely closely with semiconductor leaders Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.', 'Given that Super Micro Computer stock has surged 812% over the last year, it\'s no surprise that one Wall Street pundit has hailed the company as a ""stealth Nvidia.""', ""Could Super Micro have prospects as lucrative as Nvidia stock? Maybe. But a more thorough understanding of the company's business, underlying market trends, and valuation compared to peers should help determine if it is a buy right now."", 'Both Nvidia and AMD manufacture a series of high-end chips called graphics processing units (GPUs), which play an instrumental role in quantum computing, especially as it relates to generative AI. Super Micro does not produce semiconductors itself, but it plays an important role in how they are deployed.', ""The company specializes in designing IT architecture including server racks and storage clusters. Given the unprecedented demand for GPUs, it's not surprising that its business has been a major beneficiary."", ""I'll concede that the slope of the revenue line above is impressive. However, there are some important things to consider before pouring into Super Micro."", 'The chart below illustrates the stock movements of Nvidia and Super Micro over the last year.', ""Not only are both stocks up significantly, but they have also demonstrated eerily similar ebbs and flows throughout the last 12 months. As I wrote in a prior article, Super Micro's stock seems to trade almost in parallel with that of Nvidia. While some investors have undoubtedly profited from this theme, this dynamic does not come without significant risk."", 'For example, Arm Holdings is a smaller and somewhat troubled semiconductor company. But an encouraging earnings report earlier this year coupled with a newly revealed ownership stake from Nvidia sent Arm stock soaring, with its market cap nearly doubling in just a matter of days.', 'While Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings each have some investment merit, the overlapping feature between the two companies is that both have witnessed abnormally high buying activity thanks in large part to their relationships with Nvidia.', ""As long as demand for GPUs remain high, Super Micro should remain a beneficiary one way or another. But the primary risk I see is the company's heavy reliance on Nvidia in particular."", ""The chart above benchmarks Super Micro stock against a cohort of other IT-systems integrators on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. The analysis clearly illustrates that Super Micro's P/S of 5.3 is essentially double that of its next closest competitor, International Business Machines. Of note, IBM is a much more diversified conglomerate that even sells its own AI-powered software in addition to its many other businesses."", 'The other important thing to drive home here is that many other IT architecture companies trade at a P/S of less than 1. While it could be argued that Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell Technologies, and Lenovo have lacked innovation in recent years, the disparity among legacy players and Super Micro is tough to brush aside.', ""To me, Super Micro will need to generate market-leading revenue and profit growth in order to justify its premium valuation. But I see this as unlikely as demand for GPUs will eventually normalize, which will affect Super Micro's long-term performance. Moreover, it's paramount that the company foster and nurture relationships outside of Nvidia and AMD, since the GPU market will begin to see other players emerge -- potentially from big tech stalwarts like Amazon."", ""While I understand Wall Street's metaphorical comparison to Nvidia, investors should understand that Super Micro and chipmakers are very different businesses. The former could represent a unique stock to own outside of traditional AI opportunities."", ""But it's important to realize that the long-term investment prospects between Super Micro and other semiconductor leaders like Nvidia are not the same and carry much different risk profiles."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

Nvidia formed lucrative partnerships with companies across tech, allowing it to benefit from the growth of multiple industries."", 'Shares in Nvidia have skyrocketed 57% since Jan. 1 and have shown no signs of slowing. The tech firm rallied investors by achieving a majority market share in AI chips, which has led to soaring earnings.', ""Nvidia reported its fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings on Feb. 21. During the period, revenue rose 265% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $1.6 billion. Skyrocketing demand for AI led to a spike in graphics processing unit (GPU) sales, which saw revenue in Nvidia's data center segment increase by 409%."", ""Despite stellar growth over the last year, Nvidia is still trading at a value compared to its potential. The company's price/earnings-to-growth ratio has dropped 96% in the last six months to an attractive 0.1, making it a no-brainer buy in 2024."", ""As the home of potent brands like Windows, Office, Xbox, and LinkedIn, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a tech behemoth and one of the biggest threats in the industry. The company's shares are up 65% in the last 12 months, which saw it recently surpass Apple as the world's most valuable company, with its market cap currently at just over $3 trillion."", 'Microsoft won over investors with an expanding role in AI. Heavy investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI has led to a lucrative partnership and access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry.', ""The Windows company has used OpenAI's technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup. In 2023, Microsoft added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite by adding AI features."", 'Moreover, the company is taking early steps to monetize its new offerings, launching an AI assistant called Copilot through its Microsoft 365 subscription service. The company describes the assistant as ""your everyday AI companion."" Some of its generative capabilities include creating a first draft in Word, generating a full PowerPoint presentation based on a simple prompt, and producing data visualizations in seconds in Excel.', 'Copilot has debuted as a $30 monthly add-on to a 365 membership, which could lead to significant earnings boosts for Microsoft.', ""The company is a king in software, attracting billions of consumers and businesses to its various productivity offerings. Its products and OpenAI's AI models could prove to be a powerful combination over the long term and lead to consistent boosts to earnings. "", ""Additionally, Microsoft achieved more than $67 billion in free cash flow last year, highlighting the reliability of its business and its value as a long-term investment. The company's stock is slightly overvalued, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio at about 35. However, its long history of growth, dominant role in tech, and expanding venture into AI means it is likely worth its high valuation."", 'The Windows company is profiting from tailwinds across the industry and has excellent prospects in AI, suggesting this hypergrowth stock is one you can count on in 2024 and long into the future.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Fox's shares on or after the 5th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.26 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.52 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Fox has a trailing yield of 1.8% on the current stock price of US$29.44. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Fox ', ""Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Fox paying out a modest 30% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Luckily it paid out just 24% of its free cash flow last year."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fox's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 13% a year over the previous five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Fox has delivered 2.5% dividend growth per year on average over the past five years."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Fox? Earnings per share are down meaningfully, although at least the company is paying out a low and conservative percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's definitely not great to see earnings falling, but at least there may be some buffer before the dividend needs to be cut. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Fox's dividend merits."", ""So while Fox looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

With SATS, I think we “bought well” in the sense that our position was established at an average price of $23.40 vs. the most recent price of $17.40. There certainly remains the risk we’ve invested in a “value-trap” / “melting-ice cube,” but I’ll try to explain why I think that outlook isn’t completely accurate.', 'I tend to think of SATS as an iceberg whose peak – the portion visible above water – reflects only a small part of its totality. The visible portion is the company’s legacy satellite broadband business that, at the current time, is shedding customers at an unhealthy clip. The main culprit is most likely Elon Musk’s Starlink, which currently offers more attractive speeds (100 Mbps) and lower latency. Maybe I’m being pollyannish about the situation, but I believe when SATS brings its Jupiter 3 satellite online next year, and is capable of delivering the same speeds as Starlink, churn will not only slow, but subscriber counts should begin to rebound. SATS will never be competitive with respect to latency, but that doesn’t keep me up at night. That’s not to discount the draw of low latency, which is important for use cases such as video conferencing and gaming, but when your target customer base is scraping by with max speeds of just 25 Mbps, the prospect of 100 Mbps should be highly attractive. Moreover, as I’ve discussed in prior communications, the financial case for Starlink is unproven and it remains to be seen whether or not Musk can ever make the unit economics work…” (Click here to read the full text)', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30', 'Nasdaq, Inc.

It's evolved from a 12-company index weighted heavily toward industrial businesses in the late 1800s to one that's now made up of 30 diverse, time-tested, multinational companies."", ""The long-term success of the Dow's components has been quite the lure for investors. It just so happens that everyday investors have access to the portfolios of Wall Street's brightest minds to see what they've been up to."", ""Every quarter, money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a detailed snapshot of what top-tier asset managers bought and sold in the latest three-month period. Despite the drawback of not getting this under-the-hood look until 45 days following the end of a quarter, 13Fs still provide invaluable insight into the stocks, industries, and trends capturing the attention of Wall Street's most successful investors."", 'The latest round of 13Fs (filed on Feb. 14) was particularly significant for three Dow Jones Industrial Average components. Whereas billionaire investors absolutely piled into two outperforming Dow stocks, 13F filings also show one Dow constituent was sent to the chopping block.', ""The first Dow component that really caught the attention of billionaire money managers during the quarter ending in December was theme-park operator and media giant Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). Five prominent billionaires added to their respective funds' stakes, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):"", 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (6,340,344 shares)', 'Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,100,700 shares)', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (563,685 shares)', 'Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (309,376 shares)', ""The lure of the House of Mouse for these billionaires looks to be some combination of improved operating performance and Disney's unmatchable intangibles."", ""With regard to the former, Disney's management team has stuck by its previous forecast that the company's streaming segment will reach profitability by the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year (ending in late September 2024). Following years of sizable operating losses from its streaming segment, Disney has expanded its direct-to-consumer offerings to include an ad-inclusive tier, and it hasn't been afraid to raise its prices."", ""I'll also add that Disney is seeing incremental growth from its theme-park and entertainment divisions as we move further away from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Let's not forget that China is only a little over a year removed from abandoning its stringent COVID-19 mitigation measures."", ""The other big-time catalyst for Walt Disney is the uniqueness of its brand. There isn't another media company that has the depth of characters or storytelling that Disney brings to the table. Few businesses can so easily cross generational gaps with their products and services."", ""Having a strong brand affords the company exceptional pricing power. Admission prices for Disneyland in Southern California have outpaced the prevailing rate of inflation in the U.S. by a factor of 10 since 1955. It's also why Disney can comfortably increase streaming prices without the fear of driving away too many of its subscribers."", 'The second Dow stock that billionaires were seemingly tripping over themselves to buy during the fourth quarter was e-commerce company Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The recently added Dow component had eight billionaire investors mashing the buy button, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares)', 'Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares)', 'Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares)', 'Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares)', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares)', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)', 'Although Amazon is best known for its world-leading e-commerce marketplace, online retail sales produce menial margins and little in the way of operating cash flow or income. Chances are that billionaires piled into Amazon because of the robust growth of its ancillary segments.', ""No operating division is more important to Amazon than its cloud infrastructure service platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS accounts for close to one-third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, based on estimates from tech market analyst Canalys. Despite accounting for only one-sixth of the company's net sales, the high margins associated with cloud services have helped AWS consistently generate 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income."", ""Amazon's advertising and subscription services are fast-growing segments, too. In April 2021, then-CEO Jeff Bezos noted that his company had surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers. This figure has likely risen given that Amazon is now the exclusive streaming provider of Thursday Night Football."", 'Finally, Amazon is a logical beneficiary of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. For example, generative AI solutions within AWS can be used by merchants to tailor messages to potential buyers. As long as AI remains a red-hot investment trend, Amazon is likely to benefit and draw the attention of billionaire money managers.', 'However, not every Dow Jones Industrial Average stock was embraced by billionaires in Q4. One widely owned stock that found itself on the chopping block was telecom titan\xa0Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ).

Generally speaking, Wall Street loathes uncertainty.', ""The Federal Reserve's historic interest rate-hiking cycle was another possible sell catalyst for billionaire asset managers. Legacy telecom companies are carrying quite a bit of debt on their balance sheets. The nation's central bank increasing the federal funds rate by 525 basis points in less than two years could make future refinancing and borrowing costlier."", ""Verizon is also a mature business that's set to grow by a low-single-digit rate for the foreseeable future. With AI stocks soaring, active funds have likely been reallocating capital to faster-growing companies with more robust long-term expansion outlooks."", 'But in spite of this selling pressure, Verizon and its 6.7% yield still look like a bargain. Upgrading its network to handle 5G download speeds has increased wireless data consumption and is prompting a wave of broadband additions.', 'Furthermore, Verizon has made it clear that lead-clad cables play only a small role in its network. If the company were to have any financial liability, it would likely be determined by the notoriously slow U.S. court system. In other words, many of the reasons to be skeptical of Verizon lack substance.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walt Disney wasn’t one of them.

The $18.8 billion deal created one of the largest midstream companies in the U.S. Executives forecasted continued savings and profit through the integration of the companies for the next three years, with an initial guidance of $175 million in 2024 and a target of $125 million in 2025.', 'The savings will show in ONEOK’s refined products and crude segment’s earnings, said Sheridan Swords, ONEOK’s executive vice president of commercial liquids and natural gas gathering and processing.', 'Beyond the merger, the company’s NGL sector provided the largest share of fourth-quarter 2023 earnings at 40%. For all of 2023, ONEOK’s NGL average daily volumes increased to 1.36 Bbbl/d, up about 9% compared to 1.24 Bbbl/d in 2022.', 'As a result, ONEOK plans to continue expanding its NGL capacity. The company approved an expansion of the Elk Creek Pipeline to a capacity of 435,000 bbl/d.

Also available to answer your questions are Chuck Kelley, our Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines and Kevin Burdick, who is the Executive Vice President of Chief Enterprise Services. Record volumes, strong financial performance and the closing of the Magellan acquisition solidified 2023 as a year of significant growth and transformation for ONEOK. Momentum from our operations in 2023 is setting the stage for additional growth in 2024.', 'With our earnings release yesterday, we reported double-digit NGL and natural gas processing volume growth year-over-year and continued fee-based earnings growth in all three of our legacy business segments. We also provided 2024 guidance along with some insight into 2025 and beyond, including an expectation for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2024. Walt will provide more detail on our guidance, which is underscored by solid business fundamentals, demand for the products that we deliver, and a full year of earnings contribution from our refined products and crude oil segments and the initial realization of acquisition-related synergies. Before I turn the call over to Walt, I want to share a few data points that help sum up the exceptional growth ONEOK has experienced in recent years.', 'While our business continues to transform and to look to the future, it’s still important to reflect on what has already been accomplished. I’ll share just a handful of highlights, but there are many more. First, 2023 marked ONEOK’s 10th consecutive year of adjusted EBITDA growth throughout various commodity cycles. Over the same time period, we have increased dividends paid to $3.82 per share from $1.48 per share, a more than 150% increase. And in January, the Board approved another increase. Our volumes out of the Rocky Mountain region have set numerous records. Over the last 5 years alone, NGL volumes from the region have grown at a more than 20% annual growth rate and natural gas processing volumes have grown at a 10% annual growth rate.', 'We have continued to expand our asset portfolio, increasing our extensive pipeline network to more than 50,000 miles from approximately 30,000 miles in 2013 and adding nearly 2 Bcf per day of natural gas processing capacity and 3 fractionators. And finally, through all of this growth, both internally and by acquisition, we’ve continued to prioritize safety and our sustainability and ESG-related performance, consistently ranking towards the top of our industry peer group, including a AAA rating from MSCI. We have achieved a great deal in recent years. And over the course of our company’s history and now with a more diversified portfolio of assets, we are even better positioned to make the most of future opportunities. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Walt.', 'Walt Hulse: Thank you, Pierce. Before I get to guidance, I’ll start with a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. ONEOK’s fourth quarter and full year 2023 net income totaled $688 million and $2.7 billion respectively. Adjusted EBITDA totaled more than $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2023 and more than $5.2 billion for the full year. While there were a number of unique items contributing to the significant year-over-year increase in results such as the Medford settlement and the Magellan acquisition, the strong performance from our legacy business segments continued. Even excluding these unique one-time items, ONEOK’s adjusted EBITDA would have increased more than 15% year-over-year.', 'As of December 31, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion credit facility and had more than $335 million of cash on hand. In 2023, ONEOK extinguished $1.3 billion of long-term debt, contributing to a fourth quarter 2023 run rate net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in line with our previously discussed target of 3.5x. In January, we increased our quarterly dividend 3.7% to $0.99 per share or $3.96 per share on an annualized basis. Going forward, ONEOK expects to target an annual dividend growth rate ranging between 3% to 4%. We also announced a $2 billion share repurchase authorization, which we target to largely use over the next 4 years. This program is complementary to the dividend growth rate when thinking about shareholder return in the future.', 'Over the next 4 years, ONEOK’s combination of dividends and share repurchases is expected to trend towards a target of approximately 75% to 85% of forecasted cash flow from operations after identified capital expenditures. Our commitment to maintaining our financial flexibility and taking advantage of attractive return, capital growth opportunities that complement our now larger and more diverse operating footprint continues to be the highest priority in our capital allocation strategy. This commitment will continue to create value for our investors and support ONEOK’s position as one of the midstream leaders of return on invested capital. Now moving on to 2024 guidance. We provided a net income midpoint of more than $2.8 billion, an EPS midpoint of $4.88 per diluted share and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $6.1 billion.', 'We also include in guidance related to the synergies we expect to realize over the next couple of years. This guidance reflects higher earnings from all business segments, excluding the Medford insurance settlement and a full year contribution of the refined products and crude segment. Sheridan will provide more detail on each of the operating segments in a moment. As for synergies, we’ve assumed a midpoint of $175 million of total realized annual cost and initial commercial synergies in 2024, followed by an additional $125 million in 2025. We expect additional synergies in 2026 and beyond as capital expenditure projects to connect our NGL to the refined products and crude businesses are completed. As it relates to capital expenditures, we’ve assumed a total of $1.85 billion, which includes growth and maintenance capital.', 'This guidance reflects the investment necessary to keep up with the expected levels of producer activity and attractive return growth projects, including the MB-6 Fractionator and expansions of our West Texas NGL and Elk Creek NGL pipelines, all expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. Once these projects are completed in early 2025, we expect to be on a trend of decreasing capital expenditures over the near to medium-term. Our expected 2024 capital guidance does not include the Saguaro Connector project or any other projects that have not yet reached financial investment decision. I’ll now turn the call over to Sheridan for a commercial update.', 'Sheridan Swords: Thank you, Walt. We saw strong year-over-year volume growth in 2023 with natural gas processing volumes up 14% and NGL volumes up 10% compared with 2022. Rocky Mountain region volumes were particularly strong with double-digit growth in both NGL and natural gas processing volumes year-over-year. Higher producer activity levels, increased well connects, and continued strong gas-to-oil ratios drove record fourth quarter volumes totaling nearly 400,000 barrels per day of NGLs and nearly 1.6 Bcf per day of processed volume. Mid-Continent process volume increased 15% year-over-year and Permian Basin NGL increased 19% year-over-year, both benefiting from solid producer activity throughout the year in those regions.', 'Well connects across our operations increased more than 50% compared with 2022. We continue to see the benefit of those connections throughout 2024 as volumes ramp. Our Natural Gas Pipeline segment significantly exceeded its 2023 financial guidance range on higher earnings from long-term storage services and higher rates from negotiated fee-based contracts. Our Refined Products and Crude segment adjusted EBITDA totaled more than $420 million in the segment’s first full quarter of operations since the acquisition of Magellan. This segment’s performance was driven by midyear tariff increases, longer haul refined product shipments and steady crude oil transportation volumes. Our optimization and marketing activities, which includes liquids blending also benefited from strong margins and volumes.', 'Turning to 2024. Key drivers for our higher 2024 guidance includes stable producer activity and continued production efficiency improvements, providing strong natural gas and NGL volumes across our systems. Solid refined products demand, continued strength in fee-based earnings and rates and our first full year of annualized synergies. In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, we expect higher year-over-year adjusted EBITDA and raw feed throughput volumes should be driven primarily by growth out of the Rocky Mountain region. Despite lower assumptions for incentivized ethane recovery in 2024 and a low margin contract expiration from Overland Pass pipeline in November of 2023, we still expect higher year-over-year NGL volumes. The expired contracts volume is being replaced with higher rate barrels ramping through 2024.', 'Healthy demand for ethane from the petrochemical industry and wide gas-to-oil ratios are setting up a positive backdrop for NGL markets in 2024. On our system, we’ve assumed high levels of ethane recovery continue in the Permian Basin in 2024 and partial recovery in the Mid-Continent. We also expect to see continued opportunities to incentivize ethane recovery in the Rocky Mountain region. As Walt mentioned, we’ve officially moving forward with the expanding the Elk Creek pipeline to 435,000 barrels per day, increasing our total NGL capacity out of the Rocky Mountain region to 575,000 barrels per day. This additional capacity will support future growth and increased ethane recovery. Moving on to the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment.', 'We expect volume growth in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions driven by higher-than-anticipated well connections in 2023 and consistent producer activity levels expected in 2024. In the Rocky Mountain region, we expect processing volumes to grow 9% at the midpoint compared with 2023 and an average more than 1.6 Bcf per day in 2024. This outlook includes the impact from the weather we experienced so far this year, including well freeze-offs in mid-January when the wind chills dropped below negative 60 degrees. By the end of January, volumes had recovered to levels achieved prior to the extreme cold. Strong producer activity levels in 2023 and the continued trend of high gas-to-oil ratios drove several months of record North Dakota natural gas production with the latest record of 3.52 Bcf per day set in December.', 'Producer activity has carried over into 2024. Even through the winter months, as we enter March, there are 36 rigs in the Williston Basin with 20 on our dedicated acreage. Through detailed planning sessions with our customers, we expect additional rigs to return as we move into spring. Additionally, we continue to see a trend at producers drilling longer laterals in the basin, 3 miles in length or more as opposed to the historical 2-mile laterals. These longer laterals continue to drive improved production efficiencies and result in fewer well connections needed to grow gathered volumes. As detailed in our earnings presentation, we expect 3-mile laterals to account for approximately 30% of the wells drilled on our acreage in 2024 compared with only 7% 2 years ago.', 'In the Mid-Continent region, we are currently seeing approximately 45 rigs in Oklahoma with 6 operating on our acreage. We expect processing volumes to grow approximately 3% at our guidance midpoint compared with 2023 and average approximately 770 million cubic feet per day in 2024. Rig activity across the basin will continue to drive additional NGLs to our system. In the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we continue to expect strong demand for natural gas storage and transportation services in 2024. At the end of 2023, more than 75% of our natural gas storage capacity was contracted under long-term agreements, and our pipeline transportation capacity was nearly 96% contracted. We expect similar levels in 2024. From a natural gas storage perspective, we continue to focus on expansion projects.', 'We are currently working on a project to reactivate 3 Bcf of previously idled storage in Texas and are further expanding our injection capabilities in Oklahoma. In February 2024, the FERC approved the Saguaro Connector Pipelines presidential permit, and we expect the final investment decision on the pipeline by midyear 2024. Moving on to the Refined Products and Crude segment. We continue to expect healthy business fundamentals and the segment’s more than 85% fee-based earnings to drive consistent performance. We’ll see the full year effect of higher refined products tariff rates, driven by the midyear 2023 increase of 11.5%. And we expect additional mid-single-digit increases in July 2024. We also expect an increase in refined products volumes, including a benefit from the completion of our expansion to El Paso.', 'Additional benefits are expected from higher volumes and margins related to liquids blending in 2024, driven by favorable market conditions and synergy-related opportunities. Walt discussed commercial synergies earlier, which we expect primarily to show up in our Refined Products and Crude segment’s earnings. Pierce that concludes my remarks.', 'Pierce Norton: Thank you, Sheridan and Walt. I started this call by saying that 2023 was a year of significant growth and transformation. None of this would have been possible without our dedicated employees, with many of those employees actually listening to this call today. So I want to make sure that I thank them publicly for all that they did in 2023. With us now 5 months post closing of the acquisition, our employees have continued to focus on our integration efforts and prioritize the reliable operations of our assets in the high quality of service expected at ONEOK. Everything we have accomplished this past year means nothing if we don’t do it safely and responsibly. From an environmental perspective, we’ve made significant progress toward our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, achieving reductions that equate to approximately 50% of our total 2030 reduction target.', 'And from a safety perspective, we brought together two companies with leading safety cultures and performance. And combined, we will continue to focus on the safety and health of our employees in the communities that we operate. We’ve created an operational platform that provides increased scale, scope and diversification. It’s a platform which is already providing opportunities and enabling us to generate exceptional value for our stakeholders. Looking ahead, ONEOK is well positioned in 2024 for another year of significant growth and opportunity. With that, operator, we’re now ready for questions.', 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS.

The company revealed that the decline reflects a lower level of backlog-related shipments compared to prior quarters, while the demand shows some signs of stabilization. Our estimates for Systems revenues were pegged at $149.3 million.', 'The negative impacts of lower Systems sales were partially offset by the improved performance of Software. Software revenues increased 2% year over year to $170 million in the first quarter. Our estimates for Software’s first-quarter revenues were pegged at $170.1 million.', 'Global Service revenues (56% of the total revenues) grew 7% to $387 million.

Moreover, the non-GAAP operating profit jumped 33% year over year to $246 million, while the margin improved 900 bps to 35.5%.

If you want to skip our discussion on the real estate industry, head over to 5 Best Real Estate Stocks To Buy.\xa0', 'The global real estate market is grappling with challenges such as inflation, potential recession risks, and geopolitical uncertainties. The efforts of central banks to curb inflation are gradually proving effective, giving rise to a prevailing sentiment that interest rates may have reached their peak. Nevertheless, the lingering impact of recent policies introduces uncertainty, and economic growth is expected to moderate in 2024. Despite the anticipation of a soft landing, the resilience of many economies globally suggests that policy rates will likely remain elevated well into 2024. Lagged effects from monetary tightening, coupled with geopolitical instability and election uncertainties in major economies, pose additional potential risks to the real estate outlook.\xa0', 'According to Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL), a prominent real estate firm, inflation is subsiding in major economies, providing increased predictability in consumer and producer prices, including construction costs. The pandemic-related disruptions, including shifts in consumer shopping habits, international trade, and e-commerce, have largely settled. As a result, logistics demand is aligning more closely with historical growth trends. Office utilization has improved globally, particularly in Asia and parts of Europe, and the United States is witnessing a gradual return to office mandates. This return is expected to increase incrementally in 2024, revitalizing Central Business Districts (CBDs) with renewed daytime foot traffic and retail demand.', 'Opportunities for growth exist in specific sectors and geographical micro-markets. Distress and portfolio rebalancing efforts present opportunities for investors. JLL observed that the Living sectors, driven by an expanding world population and long-term structural trends, are expected to remain a bright spot in 2024 and beyond. The emphasis on regionalization and local manufacturing is set to continue, with the evolving global landscape of government incentives driving demand for industrial and logistics facilities. Retail is poised for a comeback in 2024, with investors returning to a sector that has transformed its dynamics to offer attractive returns and renewed rental growth. In the data center market, the global forecast points to rapid growth, driven by the evolving adoption of artificial intelligence. For real estate occupiers, 2024 is a year to solidify workplace policies, align portfolio strategies with new ways of working, and upgrade existing facilities. Focus on sustainability is intensifying, with many companies linking their future building demand to carbon commitments. The demand for low carbon workspace is expected to outstrip existing stock and the current development pipeline by 2030, presenting opportunities for sustainable building owners and developers.', ""In the next 12 to 18 months, the real estate industry will undergo a transformative period where firms are expected to reposition themselves. Deloitte's 2024 Real Estate Outlook survey, based on insights from 750 CFOs and their direct reports in major real estate firms across 11 countries, sheds light on the challenges and strategies in the global real estate landscape. Key findings from the survey indicate that concerns about the economy will significantly influence real estate decision-making. Revenue expectations have declined for two consecutive years, and to address this, real estate CFOs are planning further expense reductions, particularly in talent and office space. Expectations for the real estate property sector's fundamental conditions are the most negative since 2018. Worsening leasing fundamentals, including vacancies, leasing activities, and rental growth, are anticipated over the next 12 to 18 months. Respondents believe real estate capital markets may be approaching a market bottom, with expectations of worsening property pricing and transaction activity. Amid these challenges, property sector targets are shifting. Digital economy properties, such as data centers and cell towers, are seen as the most attractive risk-adjusted opportunity globally. Alternative sectors, including single-family rentals, build-to-rents, senior care, and life sciences, have gained ground in respondents' preferences, while traditional sectors like downtown and suburban offices have dropped in attractiveness."", 'Against a mixed landscape in the real estate sector, some of the best stocks to buy for beginners include Zillow Group, Inc.

These efforts included his management of the company and success in creating value for the company’s stockholders in connection with structuring, hedging, and monetizing the Nasdaq, Inc. common stock (the “Nasdaq Shares”) held by the company and the significant amount of income earned by the company related to these activities and the significant increase in value of such Nasdaq Shares over time.', 'In 2013, BGCP sold their ESpeed trading platform to Nasdaq for $750m in cash and ~1m shares of NDAQ stock per year for 15 years. A clause in the sale agreement stated if Nasdaq were to sell the ESpeed platform, the remaining shares would immediately be granted to BGCP. In 2018 Newmark was spun-off from BGCP and was given the remaining shares of NDAQ to be received. In 2021, Nasdaq sold ESpeed to Tradeweb. Instead of receiving 1 million shares of NDAQ for the next seven years, they received ~7m shares at once. As mentioned above, hedging instruments were used; nonetheless, it was a significant windfall for NMRK.', ""A retroactive, one-time bonus was given to Howard because of the transaction. To clarify, NMRK’s Board of Directors gave Howard a bonus because Nasdaq sold the Espeed platform. Howard was not a part of the conversation between Nasdaq and Tradeweb and undoubtedly did not influence the transaction. $50m was approximately 1.3% of the market cap of NMRK at the time, and the value of the NDAQ stock received was ~$650m after taxes and forward agreements were settled. Roughly 8% of that value was given to Howard. When the original Espeed sale to Nasdaq occurred, NDAQ stock was trading in the $30’s, putting the original value of the shares to be received in the $450-500m range. From 2014-to 2021, NDAQ’s stock rose from $40 to $200. Did Howard have anything to do with this price appreciation? I think not. Did Espeed lead to value creation for NDAQ shareholders and potentially a source for the stock appreciation? Nasdaq paid $750m in cash + 15m shares of NDAQ and subsequently sold ESpeed to Tradeweb for $190m.

CBRE estimates that the overall facilities management market will be $1.9 trillion in 2024, representing a massive growth opportunity for large global commercial real estate services companies. • The institutionalization of commercial real estate: Institutional allocations to real estate continue to increase, in part due to real estate’s diversification, inflation protection, and stable long-term growth attributes. • Opportunities to increase market share: The commercial real estate industry remains highly fragmented and is likely to continue to consolidate. Customers tend to prefer commercial real estate companies that can provide a broad set of services. We believe CBRE and Jones Lang LaSalle are best positioned to drive market share gains given that they are the clear #1 and #2 commercial real estate services firms, respectively, and they have the capability to provide the full array of real estate offerings on a global scale.', 'CBRE and Jones Lang LaSalle have scale, product breadth, and leadership positions across their diversified real estate business segments. They continue to gain market share and are well positioned to capitalize on ample attractive acquisition opportunities in the years ahead given strong and liquid balance sheets.

This signals a shift towards cautious optimism compared to the previous year's report. Despite layoffs and challenges in 2023, publishers anticipate a 2024 revenue growth of 18.5%. However, news media advertising was expected to decline by approximately 4.6% in 2023 and 3.1% in 2024. Global newspaper advertising spend has decreased, with print decline outpacing digital progress. Areas like platform partnerships and business services gained importance for publishers, while events, data, and memberships declined. Major upcoming elections and the 2024 Paris Olympics are predicted to boost revenues and audience engagement. Key areas for investment include reader revenue, product development, and diversifying revenue streams. Artificial intelligence is a top priority for investment, followed by data analytics, video, and audio/podcasts. While 34% of the surveyed news executives were very optimistic about generative AI opportunities, 67% feel their businesses are poorly prepared to capitalize on them at present."", ""Reuters Institute and the University of Oxford conducted a survey involving over 300 digital leaders from 50 countries, revealing that news organizations globally are navigating the challenges and opportunities presented by artificial intelligence. About 47% of editors, CEOs, and digital executives express confidence in the future of journalism, with concerns centered on rising costs, declining advertising revenue, and slowed subscription growth. Nearly two-thirds worry about a sharp decline in referral traffic from social media sites, particularly Facebook and Twitter. As a response, 77% of respondents plan to focus more on their direct channels, and 22% will cut costs, while 20% explore alternative third-party platforms. Publishers show increased interest in platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram, following Meta's decision to open broadcast channels. Despite challenges, publishers plan to create more video content, newsletters, and podcasts while maintaining the number of news articles. However, 54% admit a focus on maximizing attention rather than respecting audience time. On the business side, 80% of publishers view subscription and membership as crucial revenue streams. Licensing deals with AI platforms are anticipated, but 35% believe most benefits will go to large publishers, with 48% expecting little money for any publisher."", 'An Ernst & Young (EY) report on key media and entertainment trends for 2024 highlighted that consumer dissatisfaction with paying for unused TV channels led to the rise of streaming services, allowing households to customize their content and reduce costs. Media companies now face the challenge of balancing traditional linear broadcast and cable networks with streaming platforms to drive subscription and advertising revenue. Media companies are integrating artificial intelligence into different aspects of their operations, focusing on productivity and incremental growth. However, executives remain cautious about spending, risk, and quality control associated with implementing GenAI. Challenges include job security concerns in creative industries, intellectual property protection, and the need for trust, accuracy, privacy, and fairness in GenAI implementation.\xa0', 'Moreover, EY mentioned that despite a 20%+ year-over-year growth in feature films at the box office, results are still 19% below pre-COVID-19 levels. Studios are prioritizing the first-run window over day-and-date releases, leveraging successful films to drive streaming sign-ups. There is a renewed emphasis on fresh storytelling and excellence in 2024, moving away from overreliance on long-running franchises. Consumer enthusiasm for concerts, sporting events, and theme parks indicates a desire for in-person entertainment. However, the rising cost of living poses challenges to consumer spending on media and entertainment. While inflation rates decrease, industry leaders recognize the discretionary nature of entertainment spending. In 2024, media and entertainment companies aim to showcase value through creative packages, commercial partnerships, exclusive features, and dynamic pricing.\xa0', 'Some of the best entertainment stocks to buy for benefiting from the industry momentum include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Netflix, Inc.

The company has an opportunity to monetize their 180M+ monthly unique visitors, developing new subscription revenue and cash flow streams over time. The New York Times, which has a smaller audience reach than Gannett, undertook a similar successful transformation 10 years ago that lead to accelerating revenue growth and free cash flow generation. As their transformation progressed over that period, The New York Times valuation expanded, price-to-sales multiple increased from less than .5x to 3.2x and Enterprise Value to EBITDA from near 7x to 21x.', 'Gannett’s share price today presents a similar long-term opportunity as it implies no value from a successful transformation. Gannett’s valuation multiples are near all-time lows, price to sales multiple of .13x and an EV/EBITDA near 5x. Ongoing operational progress and debt reduction has the potential to accelerate free cash flow generation and unlock significant equity value overtime. In addition, Gannett’s anti-trust lawsuit against Google is underappreciated in my view as it has the potential to further accelerate the transformation. Winning the case could result in a reward in excess of $1B (anti-trust suits awards can be triple damages).

The visible portion is the company’s legacy satellite broadband business that, at the current time, is shedding customers at an unhealthy clip. The main culprit is most likely Elon Musk’s Starlink, which currently offers more attractive speeds (100 Mbps) and lower latency. Maybe I’m being pollyannish about the situation, but I believe when SATS brings its Jupiter 3 satellite online next year, and is capable of delivering the same speeds as Starlink, churn will not only slow, but subscriber counts should begin to rebound. SATS will never be competitive with respect to latency, but that doesn’t keep me up at night. That’s not to discount the draw of low latency, which is important for use cases such as video conferencing and gaming, but when your target customer base is scraping by with max speeds of just 25 Mbps, the prospect of 100 Mbps should be highly attractive.

These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives, including but not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, and lease and contract termination costs, as well as related professional service costs associated with these restructuring initiatives and global transformation activity. The Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency; consequently, restructuring charges may recur but are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity, and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company. Other costs include gains and losses on the sale of property, charges related to legal settlements, executive separation costs, write-offs of inventory as a result of product rationalization, and changes in accounting principles recorded within the period.

This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value. Although these costs contribute to revenue generation and will recur in future periods, their amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, and as such may not be indicative of the future performance of the Company.', '(5) Fair value and credit risk adjustments. These adjustments include the non-cash mark-to-market changes in fair value associated with pension assets and obligations, the credit risk component of hedging instruments, and equity-method investments. Although these adjustments are recurring in nature, they are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in the underlying assumptions and market conditions. The non-service component of pension expense is a recurring item, however it is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, interest rates, plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances.

These comments are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please take note of the cautionary language and risk factors provided in our SEC filings and earnings materials. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick."", 'Richard E. Muncrief', ""Thank you, Scott, and I appreciate everyone taking time to join us this morning. For today, my comments will be centered on 4 key themes: Devon's accomplishments in 2023, the catalyst of our improved outlook for 2024, the depth of the resource we possess in our portfolio, and the strategic priorities that will drive our free cash flow allocation going forward.Now beginning with the fourth quarter, we exited the year with a solid quarter of execution, highlighted by production that exceeded the top end of guidance, meeting consistency across all products. Disciplined reinvestment resulted in our 14th consecutive quarter of free cash flow, and we took steps to increase cash returns by stepping up the pace of our stock buyback. These positive results rounded out another successful year for Devon, where we achieved several key milestones that I am extremely proud of.On Slide 7, you can see we delivered production growth rate of 8% in 2023, resulting in new high all-time production for oil. This healthy growth rate was also paired with returns on capital employed that outpaced the S&P 500 by a substantial margin for the third straight year. With the free cash flow our business produced, we rewarded shareholders with an impressive cash return yield of around 10% that was balanced between buybacks and dividends.As I touched on during the last call, our team has done a great job of designing a plan to deliver improved capital efficiency in 2023 -- excuse me, 2024. With the current industry conditions, we still believe it is prudent to deploy a steady capital program designed to optimize returns while maintaining volumes around levels where we exited 2023. Importantly, we expect to deliver this production for 10% less capital versus last year, funded at a WTI breakeven price of around $40. In conjunction with this outlook and given the confidence that we have in the underlying health of our business, the Board has approved a 10% increase to a fixed dividend payout. Now looking briefly at the trajectory of our capital production profile in 2024 on Slide 9, we plan to be spending to be slightly elevated in the first half of the year due to the addition of a fourth completion crew in the Delaware Basin. Due to timing of completions and recent curtailments from extreme winter weather, we expect first quarter production to be the lowest quarter of the year. However, we expect volumes and capital efficiency to move higher over the remainder of the year.In 2024, a key contributor to our improved capital efficiency will be the well productivity improvements we expect to achieve in the Delaware Basin.Turning to Slide 12. And with the easing of constraints across the basin, we plan to concentrate roughly 70% of the Delaware's capital in New Mexico while optimizing the remaining activity across our acreage in Texas. This allocation to New Mexico is meaningfully higher than what we were able to deploy during 2023 and is more in line with our historic activity in the basin. Overall, this refined capital allocation is expected to increase well productivity in the Delaware by up to 10% on a year-over-year basis. Given that 2/3 of our Delaware Basin inventories in New Mexico, we anticipate being able to sustain our pace of activity on both sides of the Stateline for the foreseeable future. With this advantaged acreage footprint, you can see on Slide 14 that we have one of the largest inventories among operators in the basin, providing us with a multi-decade resource that will drive our enterprise-wide performance for many years to come.The quality of our Delaware weighted resource base, combined with our disciplined strategy positions us to generate a differentiated amount of free cash flow for many years to come. As you can see on Slides 15 and 16, our business is set to deliver a free cash flow yield that is up to 3x that offered by the broader markets. With this free cash flow, we are targeting a cash return payout of around 70%, while earmarking the remainder to further strengthen our balance sheet.With our flexible cash return framework, we will judiciously allocate our free cash flow toward the best opportunity, whether that be buybacks or dividends. Given that the equity market is heavily discounting valuations in the energy sector, it's an easy decision to prioritize the buyback over the variable dividend to capture the incredible value that Devon offers at these historically low valuations.Slide 19 helps better visualize this compelling value proposition. On the right, you can see energy represents less than 4% of the S&P 500 while contributing more than 10% of the EBITDA in 2023. This is noteworthy given the Energy's S&P weighting historically tracks its earnings contribution over time. I believe this gap exist due to extreme valuations in tech, combined with a pervasive misunderstanding of hydrocarbon demand over time.With global energy demand forecasted to increase 50% by 2050, the world is going to need growth from all sources of energy, including oil and natural gas. With the world's power needs continuing to grow, it is evident that peak oil demand is nowhere in sight, and our industry will be an important contributor of energy growth for the foreseeable future.Furthermore, high-quality names like Devon, provide significant equity upside over time as you collect outsized cash returns. And as I said earlier, this is why we are putting our money to work actively repurchasing shares. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Clay."", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. The Devon team did a really good job of rounding out 2023 by exceeding our operational targets for the fourth quarter. These positive results were driven by 3 key factors: number one, improved uptime, driving base production; number two, increased efficiencies through faster cycle times, resulting in lower capital per well; and number three, better new well productivity, improving our wedge production volume. Slide 5 provides a good visual of these favorable operating trends. The chart on the left highlights the efficiencies we've delivered in our drilling and completions operations. On the right, you can see this track record of efficiency gains is also paired with some of the best well productivity of any producer in the U.S. While these results can certainly vary from quarter-to-quarter, our consistency over time demonstrates the quality of our assets and execution capabilities. The most significant contributor to this advantaged capital efficiency was our franchise asset in the Delaware Basin. In the fourth quarter, roughly 60% of our capital was deployed to this prolific basin allowing us to run a consistent program of 16 rigs.This activity -- with this activity, we brought online 62 new wells, grew productivity 6% year-over-year and expanded our DUC inventory, allowing us to add a fourth completion crew earlier this year. While we had strong results across our acreage position, in the quarter, the top contributors to our performance were several large pads within our Cotton Draw and Stateline areas. At Cotton Draw in the core of the basin, we brought on 11 3-mile laterals that showcased the stacked pay potential and prolific rates this area can deliver. These extended reach wells were diversified across 5 different producing intervals in the Avalon, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations. In aggregate, the oil-weighted production from these wells achieved a 30-day rates of 4,400 BOE per day with impressive per well recoveries trending as high as 4 million BOE. In addition to the high rates at Cotton Draw, we also delivered record-setting drilling and completion times. This performance included a record completion pace of 3,100 feet per day, and drilling times for these 3-mile laterals came in as low as 19 days with the final mile drilled in a record time of just over 24 hours. Another standout performance during the quarter and possibly my favorite in terms of naming convention was our clawhammer project in the Stateline area. Clawhammer was named by a geologist after the style of playing the banjo that his dad used in their family jam sessions. The good news for him and his family is that these wells are fantastic. This 8-well pad consists of 2-mile laterals, codeveloped in multiple intervals in the Wolfcamp A with production rates averaging 3,900 BOE per day. This package of wells delivered the highest well productivity per lateral foot of any project during the quarter.As I look ahead to 2024, I expect another big year for the Delaware Basin as we have a great slate of projects lined up. We plan to bring online around 215 wells for the year with most of the capital deployed towards the best parts of our acreage in Southern Lea and Eddy Counties and the Stateline area of Texas. This plan is designed to deliver improved capital efficiency and better well productivity through the full column of development of the Upper Wolfcamp, along with select landing zones in the Wolfcamp B where applicable. The derisking of multiple targets in the Wolfcamp B over the past year has allowed us to pursue more extensive multi-zone developments in 2024, bolstering our high-quality inventory, delivering higher net present value per project and still delivering exceptional rates of return.Turning to Slide 13. To build upon Rick's comments from earlier, we're confident in our ability to deploy more capital to the core of the Delaware because of a long list of improvements in infrastructure. These improvements include 2 Bcf a day of processing additions -- gas processing additions, expansions to the downstream gas takeaway, enhanced water handling capabilities with our WaterBridge joint venture, build-out of gathering and compression and investment in self-generated power and microgrids to increase the reliability of the electrical infrastructure. With these improvements, we are very well positioned to execute on our 2024 plan. In fact, year-to-date, we're delivering at a pace ahead of schedule, allowing us to fully offset the winter weather downtime we experienced in January across the field. Shifting to the Eagle Ford. The successful integration of our Validus acquisition was one of the key drivers of the production increase of 56% during 2023. With our enhanced scale in the basin, the team did a great job of capturing synergies by driving improvements across each phase of our operations. This progress can be seen through several indicators, including year-over-year 15% decrease in production costs, a 30%-plus improvement in completion cycle times over the course of the year, and we set a company record spud to rig release of only 5 days. Our activity during the year continued to demonstrate that the Eagle Ford provides one of the most promising opportunities for resource upside in the U.S. shale. Through tighter redevelopment spacing and refracs, our capital program not only replenished, but expanded our risk resource in the play to an inventory runway of around 10 years at today's pace of activity.Looking to 2024, our key focus for the Eagle Ford team is to sharpen capital efficiency by incorporating appraisal learnings from the past year, along with more balanced activity across DeWitt and Karnes County. This plan is expected to deliver single-digit production growth for roughly $75 million less capital over last year.In the Rockies, we possess a unique combination of assets that can provide both growth and free cash flow specifically in the Powder River Basin, we are building upon the well productivity improvements achieved over the past couple of years, where the average 6-month cumes increased nearly 20% from historic levels. A recent highlight was the [SHU Iberlin 3X] well, which reached peak rates in Q4. This 3-mile Niobrara well achieved initial production rates greater than 1,500 BOE per day with an 85% oil cut and then hung in at that rate for quite a while.In addition to the strong oil productivity, the Iberlin attained a record drilling performance of 1,350 feet per day, a 45% improvement compared to the average Niobrara well. In 2024, our efforts will be focused on refining spacing, reducing costs and continue to ready this asset for full development in the later part of this decade. In the Williston, I want to thank the team for safely working through the incredibly severe winter storm weather that we experienced in January and rapidly restoring affected production. As I look into 2024, our focus for this asset will be to optimize base production, deploy selective investments to high-confidence projects, and harvest $300 million of field level cash flow. So far this year, our capital program is off to a great start with our bull moves project maxing out our production facilities at over 15,000 barrels of oil per day with several of the wells flowing 3,000 barrels per day or more during their flowback.Lastly, I'd like to briefly cover our activity in the Anadarko Basin, where we delivered an 8% production growth rate during 2023. The 3-rig drilling program funded by our Dow joint venture, delivered very impressive well production. The value of this production was also enhanced by our ability to route volumes into the premium Southeast gas markets and by the team driving operational costs 10% lower. In 2024, we plan to maintain a similar pace of drilling activity in the Anadarko with a keen focus on developing the liquids-rich window of the play, where returns from our joint venture activity will benefit from higher condensate cuts. And with that, I'll turn the call to Jeff for a financial review. Jeff?"", 'Jeffrey L. Ritenour', ""Thanks, Clay. I'll spend my time today discussing the highlights of our financial performance in 2023 and the priorities for our free cash flow as we head into 2024. Beginning with our fourth quarter financial performance, Devon's operating cash flow totaled $1.7 billion, exceeding consensus estimates and represents the highest quarterly total of the year. This cash flow comfortably funded our capital spending and resulted in $827 million of free cash flow, driving full year free cash flow to $2.7 billion. Even in the face of headwinds from lower commodity prices, this level of free cash flow ranks as one of the highest in Devon's 50-year-plus history. Another powerful example of the consistent financial results, our disciplined strategy can deliver.As Rick touched on earlier, with this free cash flow, we're targeting a cash return payout of 70% with the remainder reserved for balance sheet improvement. Slide 23 in the appendix is a good exhibit representing how we allocated our cash returns in the most recent quarter. Given the compelling valuation of our equity, we prioritize share repurchases over the variable dividend. This resulted in us repurchasing 5.2 million shares in the fourth quarter at a total cost of $234 million. In 2024, we've continued to actively acquire shares through our 10b5-1 program, and we plan to supplement this with systematic buying with open market purchases during the year. With plenty of runway remaining in our $3 billion buyback authorization, we see Devon's current valuation as a great opportunity to compound the per share growth for our investors.In addition to our buyback activity, we delivered investors an attractive stream of income through our fixed plus variable dividend framework. In the fourth quarter, we declared a dividend payout of $0.44 per share that is payable at the end of March. This dividend consists of the Board's approval to increase the fixed dividend by 10% to $0.22 per share and declare a variable distribution of $0.22 per share. We continue to believe dividends are a great way to reward shareholders and are a critical contributor to total returns over time. We also believe that the flexibility designed into our dividend framework allows us to return meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash to shareholders across a variety of market conditions through the cycle.Moving to the balance sheet. Devon's investment-grade financial position continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter with cash balances increasing by $144 million to a total of $875 million. In addition to our strong liquidity, we exited the year with low leverage marked by a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.7x. Looking ahead with the excess free cash flow that accrues to our balance sheet, we plan to build liquidity and retire maturing debt. Our next debt maturity comes due in September of this year, totaling $472 million and we will have the opportunity to retire another $485 million of notes in 2025.So in summary, our financial strategy is working well. We have successfully scaled our business to consistently generate free cash flow. We are boosting per share results by opportunistically repurchasing our shares. We offer a dividend yield that far exceeds that of the broader market and the balance sheet is in great shape with a clear pathway of continued improvement over the next few years. With that, I'll turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments."", 'Richard E. Muncrief', ""Thank you, Jeff. So to wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to reinforce a few key messages. Number one, Devon is a great company that has created a tremendous amount of value for shareholders since we unveiled our industry-first cash return strategy announced in 2020. Since that time, we've deployed $13 billion to dividends, buybacks, debt reduction and accretive acquisitions. I'm extremely proud of this accomplishment, but we're just getting started.2024 is setting up to be another wonderful year for Devon. By incorporating learnings from the past year and refining our capital allocation, we expect to deliver a step change improvement in capital efficiency this year. This improved capital efficiency is anchored by our assets in the Delaware Basin where we expect to deliver the powerful combination of improved well productivity for much lower capital cost. Our long-duration resource base underpinned by the Delaware is one of the deepest of any company out there. The resource quality provides us an advantaged platform to drive attractive per share growth and outsized cash returns for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott, and let's have some Q&A."", 'Scott Coody', ""Thanks, Rick. We'll now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up. This allows us to get to more of your questions on the call today. With that, operator, we'll take our first question."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We do have our first question registered comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.', 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""Yes. Rick, I know over the last year, you've talked about some of your frustration around execution on the oil volume side, that is going to be an important year for that operational inflection. It does seem like we're seeing some evidence of that with capital efficiency and holding the 315 oil guide. So maybe you could just give us your perspective on whether we're at that inflection point from an ops perspective?"", 'Richard E. Muncrief', ""Neil, that's a good question. We have expressed our frustration, I think, in the market really -- we really traded down on some of our variances we saw last year in our production volumes. But even though they were minor that the -- from a volumetric standpoint, they weren't from a stock performance standpoint. So I think the setup is really good for investors as we look forward. So it is going to be, I believe, point of inflection for us as we've mentioned.Really bullish about our performance. The team has done a wonderful job, getting us through some tough weather. We've seen some increased productivity. I think Clay went through the assets really well, and we're seeing nice growth on the oil side coming out of this first quarter as we enter second, third, fourth quarters of this year. And I'll also say, Neil, I feel really good about the next several years on our ability to keep crude volumes where they're at. I think that it's -- we're still early. We still are not getting what I think is a strong, strong signal for demand. But when that call comes, I think we'll be ready to step up for it. But we really feel good about the trends we're seeing."", 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""Yes. And just maybe to build on this, this maybe a question for Clay but just can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of well productivity that gives you confidence in your ability to hit or exceed that 315 oil number this year?"", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Neil. This is one of the frustrating things about a publicly traded company. We get to see what's coming. We get to see what's happening well before the market does. And so where I can see the improvement internally in the well productivity from the first half of last year to the second half of last year, those numbers are just starting to hit the public markets and through the public sources. And so I think that's pretty evident for those that are paying attention that this is not first quarter '24, we decided to turn on the production. This is an evolution. We wanted to make some really thoughtful investments in the future of the company. We did that. The market, I believe, responded pretty vigorously to that. We've since made some changes in the planning, the well delivery, the well performance is really significantly taken an uptick. As I mentioned, even late last year, you see some of that coming through the public sources. We're going to -- it's really going to manifest in 2024 and as Rick mentioned, we're just off to a really good start, even recovering from a pretty severe storm that we saw somewhere 1% to 2% impact. We always bake in winter weather, but an event like that was pretty out of the norm. The productivity of the wells, the performance we've been able to overcome that, and we feel really good about delivering -- being able to deliver the '24 full year numbers."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.', 'Arun Jayaram', ""Rick and Clay, you've highlighted your expectations to deliver up to 10% well productivity gains in the Delaware Basin. I was wondering if you could maybe help us provide more details on what is driving that? It sounds like there's going to be some high grading for Monument Draw to Southeast of Mexico. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's driving that and -- and if completion optimization is also a driver of better year-over-year productivity?"", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Thanks for the question, Arun. I think both things come into play. The big headline thing is just a refocus to more where we've historically allocated our capital kind of in the core of the basin predominantly where our inventory, our portfolio lays out between New Mexico and Texas. I would say '23, especially first half of '23, was a little bit of an anomaly on where we were allocating that capital, and we needed to do some work from the infrastructure standpoint, but also really understanding where all these fit together. We're benefiting tremendously from that work, from that infrastructure build-out, and that's where we're seeing the improvement really late '23 to what we're showing today.On the completions question, I wouldn't point to it's a big knob that we've changed on like a sand concentration or how we're doing, what we're doing, but the team is working every single day to think about how do we do it better, how do we touch a little bit more rock and how do we do it more cost effectively. And I can tell you we're winning on all fronts. These are small wins at this point, some relatively mature way of thinking about these assets, but really, really pleased with the continued improvement there, and that shows up in the numbers as well."", 'Arun Jayaram', 'Quick follow-up, Rick, Devon, as you know, has been linked to a few M&A deals in the financial press. I was wondering if you could just comment on where you sit today in terms of your A&D strategy, and how you gain some of the inorganic opportunities versus, as Jeff mentioned, the ability to buy back your stock at a 9% kind of free cash flow yield today?', 'Richard E. Muncrief', ""Yes. Very good question. Arun, our answer has really not changed that much over the last several years. We're going to continue to evaluate opportunities. When you're in 5 basins, you have some great opportunities in all 5 of those, and we watch that. We stay attuned to those opportunities as they become available or it's the right time for us to think about that. So I think we're going to continue to see the high bar. We're going to -- it's got to be -- it has to have some accretion, it has to have the industrial logic that we have always talked about. And it just has to make us a better company. And if it fits in that framework, man, I think that's our job is to create value for shareholders. And so we're going to do that. We also have been advocates for consolidation. I think some of the transactions that's been announced that I think that's the -- I think they're positive for the industry. And it just shows that we are a depleting industry. And so you always have to replenish. That's your portfolio that's not changed. It's not changed since the beginning of this industry. And so we'll always be active. We've got a great team. We've got great analytics, capabilities in-house, and we do our own internal analytics compare that with what you see out in the public market and adjust.But once again, we're going to be very, very measured, very disciplined. And we will make -- we will make some -- I think the right decisions, and that does include the buying our stock back because I can tell you that at these levels, we are very, very attractive. Great question."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Nitin Kumar from Mizuho.', 'Nitin Kumar', ""Great. Rick, I've heard you saying just a multiple times today that buybacks are very attractive, especially at these levels. But as I look at fourth quarter, the mix actually favor dividends, including a variable payout a bit. Not to nitpick or anything like that, but just want to understand what drove the decision? We applaud the 10% increase on the base dividend but what drove the decision for the variable dividend? And how should we see that evolve in 2024?"", 'Jeffrey L. Ritenour', ""Nitin, this is Jeff. Keep in mind that there is some variance in the timing of the variable dividend payout, right? So when we announced it, it actually gets paid in the subsequent quarter. So maybe that's what you're alluding to as it relates to the mix. But with our framework going forward, we're going to simply, each quarter, focus on delivering about 70% of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of that fixed dividend, which, obviously, we grew at 10% here on a year-over-year basis. That's the first and foremost going to be a priority for us, and we're going to look to continue to grow that on an annual basis going forward.Then beyond that, we're absolutely biased towards leaning in on the share repo here in the near term. And frankly, the variable dividend will fall out of the back of that based on that 70% threshold that I hit on earlier. So we're going to continue to expect to have a higher mix of buyback going forward. And that's going to be our priority as we walk it through this year."", 'Nitin Kumar', 'Okay. And then my next question is really for Clay probably. Clay, impressive improvements in operating efficiencies, days drilled, days completed. Just curious, is there any specific technologies that you would point to that have helped you achieve those? And I guess never say never, but where are we in terms of those efficiencies? Are we getting to some sort of baseline? Or do you think we can continue to deliver those types of improvements?', 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Nitin, it really goes down -- goes back to just the core operating team. These are highly talented, highly motivated individuals that are absolutely trying to do the right thing ultimately for the shareholders they work for. Now I will remind you, this is the same team working just as hard with just as much creativity this year as they were last year. What we found is we really needed to focus. We underestimated what a slight change in capital efficiency during the first half of '23, meant to investors. I think that was way over extrapolated into us running out of inventory, not being able to do this anymore. We lost our mines, all that good fund. And what we showed is like hang on a second. We still have the capabilities. We've got some really impressive inventory, some great quality. And importantly, these are hard-working impressive people that continue to find a way to do it better each quarter. And this is so many things below the radar that don't always show up in the (inaudible) data, don't show up in the financials.I can tell you, we're winning on lots and lots of fronts and there's more that to come. So really excited about the go forward. I think we've got some good transparency in our slides on quantity of resource, quality of resource. I expect in '24 that we will regain a little bit of public mojo, but that, to me, is just -- it's a little overdue. So looking forward to sharing that win with the team."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.', 'Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine', ""This is actually Kalei on for Doug. For my first question, I want to go back to the buyback, just to follow up. I want to understand the motivations behind the strategy for '24. Shifting capital back to the Delaware and the margin is obviously an efficiency shift and that makes sense, but in tandem, you're also leading back into the buyback and that looks rather intentional. So can you talk about why you see the buyback as a preferred allocation today? And why has that changed over the past several months?"", 'Jeffrey L. Ritenour', ""Yes, you bet. So again, on the buyback front, what's pretty clear to us as we kind of walk through our framework for evaluating share repo, versus the other capital allocation opportunities that we have, whether it be organic investment, inorganic investment that Rick spoke to earlier, whether it's M&A or otherwise. And then when we step back and look at the valuation, we look at the multiples, we look at our intrinsic value model that we keep in-house and run multiple sensitivities on that. Every which way we turn, what we keep coming back to is the our shares look undervalued relative to the broader market relative to the sector and certainly relative to the results that we expect to post as we walk our way through this year. So -- that really has been the driver and our focus going back half of last year and as we walk into 2024, and it's why we're biased towards having the lion's share of our cash returns be focused on the share repurchase going forward."", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""And if I could, I just want (inaudible) I'm sorry, I just want to add one comment on that prior question. I think it's a common misconception the way we lay the numbers out that we are leaning in or that we're increasing capital to the Delaware somehow accelerating, that's not really the case. We are the same rig count, same level of activity. The capital is actually coming down, not just in the total company, but in Delaware, but where we're seeing the 10% inflection from the company is really a reduction in some of the other areas.So proportionately, Delaware is moving up, but on an absolute basis, we're not consuming that inventory any faster than we had in '23 or years before."", 'Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine', ""Got it. I appreciate that. That's where my follow-up will go. So I'm wondering if the reduction in the capital in these other areas, what kind of permanent does that have? Is it sort of a soft cap until you figure out what's going on in the Bakken? Or is this now the direction of the program?"", 'Clay M. Gaspar', 'Was the question permanents?', 'Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine', 'Yes. The permanents of the capital allocation.', 'Clay M. Gaspar', 'Permanents meaning how long...', 'Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine', 'Yes. Yes.', 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Can we do it multiple years? I'm just making sure I understand the question."", 'Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine', 'Yes. How many years can you run this kind of capital program?', 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Okay. All right. Thank you for that. Sorry, the acoustics in here weren't quite right. Sorry about that. Yes, I think in pulling back the activity, for example, in the Williston Basin, that prolongs that basin's opportunity to continue to deliver free cash flow and offset some of that fall in production with some really healthy wells. What we found is we were pushing a little too quickly, a little too much capital to that asset by having the multiple basins that we do, having our franchise asset in the Delaware Basin. It allows us to take a little bit of pressure off that team, allows them to really make sure that all the ducks are in a row ready for that next pad. And then selectively, we're going to fund those. And as you saw with the bull moves that I talked about on the call, these are phenomenal. These are awesome returns, and we've got more of that to come."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist.', 'Neal David Dingmann', ""Clay, first question for you. It's on your Delaware infrastructure and takeaway. I'm just wondering, after adding so much (inaudible) where you talked about adding so much processing, gathering, compression, water -- just wondering now, are you all able to handle the continued notable upside that's going to come with the development plan? Or will there be a continued buildout?"", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Neal, we feel really good about being able to effectively produce. Remember, we are really watching our flaring. We don't want to have unnecessary shut-ins. We are reliant on so many third parties. We wanted to make sure that we had that runway ahead of these very prolific pads coming online. We want to make sure we have that. We do feel very confident in that today. And remember, it's not just our immediate wells. We've got some really high-quality offset operators that know what they're doing as well. It's a phenomenal basin, and we have to make sure that all of that plays together very nicely. And so that we have the reliability in the infrastructure to bring these wells online and make sure we ultimately get them to market."", 'Neal David Dingmann', ""Yes, it makes sense. And then my second is just on the Eagle Ford, specifically. Can you give details -- I think you talked about 85 to 95 well plan, I'm just wanted to focus here be on existing key areas like you're doing in the Del and just maybe talk about any improvements we should think about specifically in this area?"", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Thanks for that question. I'm really excited about the Eagle Ford. One of the things, unlike a lot of other areas, we've continued to test downspacing tighter wells, subsequent well after the initial development has been done, bringing additional wells in, which is really not very favorable in most basins, it tends to work and continue to provide upside in the Eagle Ford. Now when you pair that with some of the refrac activity, we can actually feather in new wells, refrac some of the existing wells, and we're seeing phenomenal results.As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are continuing to expand the runway there without any M&A dollars without -- just from the existing footprint, the opportunity set continues to expand and these are very prolific, very accretive to the bottom line kind of numbers that we're really excited about."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kevin MacCurdy from Pickering Energy Partners.', 'Kevin Moreland MacCurdy', ""My first question is on the capital budget. We appreciate that the $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion range is a significant decrease year-over-year. But if we look back at last year's budget, we noticed that the range is wider both on absolute dollars on a percentage basis this year. I was wondering if you could provide any color on what might put you at the low end of that range versus the high end of the capital range. Is that driven more by deflation, turning lines or midstream spend?"", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Yes. It's interesting, Kevin. One of the first thing that comes to mind for me is the efficiency that I talked about in a couple of my slides, you guys know this very well. We've been at this game for quite a while. Sometimes that efficiency can pull more activity into the calendar year. Look, this is not our first rodeo. This is February. We're already watching that for the full year. We're committed to this range. But if I had to think of what could cause us to kind of float to the upside, it's probably that kind of work where you're seeing more opportunities bring some of that activity from '25 into '24.I think on the downside, there's -- we're early in the year. I think the supply chain deflation opportunities are still -- we've got a 5% year-over-year kind of baked in. I feel good about that. I feel very confident we're going to be able to deliver that. As the year plays out, we really need to see where that changes over time. My current crystal ball doesn't see a lot of inflation, but there's certainly deflation opportunities in that number, and that potentially could allow us to floater -- float down to the lower end of that range."", 'Kevin Moreland MacCurdy', ""I appreciate the detail on that. And as a follow-up, the Eagle Ford had a strong production quarter, and it looks like the CapEx guidance for that asset is fairly consistent year-over-year. Can you talk about the production and capital efficiency outlook in the Eagle Ford? And if there's any major changes between 2023 and 2024?"", 'Richard E. Muncrief', ""Kevin, this is Rick. One of the things that I've been really proud of over the last 12 to 18 months is coming on the heels of the Validus acquisition, what we have been able to learn at a solid acreage. It's -- I would say it is second, certainly to our Black Hawk acreage. But the thing about it that we need to remind investors of and analyst of is that on the Black Hawk acreage, it's a 50-50 joint venture with BPX. BPX operates the drilling and the completion of that. And what we felt it was really from a -- not only a productivity increase, but also just a strategic perspective, we thought it was imperative that we had an asset that we owned that we did the drilling that we did the completions on. The 5-day well that Clay referenced a while ago, I can tell you that absolutely exceeded anything that we had in our Validus development plan.So when I look at that, I look -- now we're having some very, very meaningful discussions with our joint venture partner there. And they're very constructive, and I think it's going to lead to even better performance over time in the Eagle Ford. I'm really pleased with what we're seeing with the refrac program. It's going to continue to drive some -- I think, some long-term sustainability down there that a lot of people, I think, are underestimating. So I'll turn it over to Clay to add any additional color, but the Eagle Ford is an area I can tell you that we're very excited about."", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Yes. Thanks for those comments, Rick. I think that's spot on. Kevin, the only thing I wanted to add is I do show a relatively meaningful drop, probably about a 10% or so drop in capital about $75 million, a rough number I had from '23 to '24 and -- so -- and again, that's with single-digit production growth on top of that. Now there is some well mix in there. We have a joint venture partner on part of the assets. We own the rest. We operate kind of a normal fashion. So there is some change in mix. But from a capital efficiency standpoint, things are moving in the right direction, and we continue to see upside potential on this particular asset."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup.', 'Scott Andrew Gruber', 'Yes. The 10% improvement in productivity that you forecast in the Permian is normalized on a 10,000-foot lateral. Is there going to be a step-up in lateral length in the play as you refocus on the quarter? Or is that going to be rather consistent?', 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Scott, it's pretty consistent year-over-year. We're always trying to drill longer laterals. It's kind of the opportunity set in front of us. We're always -- we feel very confident in our ability to deliver 3-mile laterals from a productivity from an operational standpoint. The land mix doesn't always allow for that. So we're going to be north of 2 miles, but not too much north, and it will be fairly consistent year-over-year."", 'Scott Andrew Gruber', ""Got it. And then just a nuance one on the 1Q guide. -- last quarter, you provided that 305 of oil per day. Today, you're guiding for 640 with a 2% weather impact. But 640 at 48% oil cut, you kind of still around maybe even slightly better than that 305 figure than last quarter. So the question is, is the underlying trend in oil production slightly better, and it's just being offset by bigger weather impact? Or is the weather risk that was incorporated in that original 305 guide kind of similar to what actually transpired?"", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Scott, I think it's really the well mix. We've got some wells coming on the -- Williston wells are exceptionally high oil cut. We continue to bring those in. I think that's just working in our favor in that regard."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC.', 'Scott Michael Hanold', ""Yes. If I can delve into the infrastructure a little bit more. On Page 13, you obviously bucket 3 areas that you're focused on in terms of building support for the 2024 plan. As you think about the Permian development over the next 2, 3, 4 years, like which area really are you focused most primarily on to make sure you're executing on the plan? Like where do you see the risk of the biggest constraint, I guess, is the question?"", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Scott is all of the above an option. No, I mean, seriously, any one of these things gets constrained and you're dead in the water, at least constrained. And so we work really hard to not just build what is the best rate of return opportunity set in our portfolio, but we're very thoughtful about modeling our own infrastructure, even modeling third-party infrastructure if we don't feel that they do an adequate job. And then there's the occasional curve ball where one of the third parties maybe even in the electrification front, can't come through with their normal pace. We need to have enough flexibility, enough forethought, enough creativity to be able to solve some of those problems essentially for them.So one of the things I mentioned is building out more of our own electrical infrastructure, we have about 700 miles of electrical -- electric lines in our basin already. We generate some of our own power. We have our own micro grids. And this is really taking the bull by the horns out of necessity because otherwise, the local power providers were not going to be able to keep up. So those are the kind of proactive steps that we really leaned in probably with double effort in '23 because some of these historical norms have really changed, and we want to make sure that we didn't just bring on a bunch of wells and then be abnormally constrained and have to answer questions about why our wells are so terrible.So anyway, I feel really good about the work that we did in '23 that we continue to do in '24, but look, we're not out of the woods. We continue to look at infrastructure needs in '26, '27 and '28. We're working with partners as best we can, and I really think we have a great runway ahead of us. But the team is always on caution to make sure that we are prepared for those unforeseen challenges."", 'Scott Michael Hanold', ""Okay. And as my follow-up, it's going to be on M&A. And I was hoping to get a deeper sense of how you think about M&A. And it's really 2 parts. One, first, if you can comment on some of the recent deals that have been out there, if you all participated and really what was the gives and takes of why -- if you did, why Devon didn't went out? And then number two, you all mentioned obviously, you're a multi-basin player, but like when you think about like does Devon have the scale right now that it would like? And if you were to add would it be really most a Permian thing? Or are other of those basins open to more significant M&A for Devon?"", 'Richard E. Muncrief', ""Yes, it's Rick. I'll field that one. Number one, I really like the scale that we currently have. We have a deep resource base across our 5 basins that we're in. So I feel really good about that. Now we're always -- as I mentioned earlier, we're always going to be looking to be opportunistic to add resource, to add investment opportunities at a reasonable value, at an attractive value for our shareholders. I think that's just really incumbent upon this management team to always be on the hunt there.That being said, we are going to be very disciplined. Some of the recent transactions, I think that were out there that were announced. When I look at the metrics on those, those were rich. It really were. And others, there have been a couple of them that were hats off. Very nice deals that we certainly weren't participating in those processes, but good for them. And that's great. Congratulations. But for us, I want to just continue to drive on the point. We're going to continue to be disciplined, and we have to balance short-term accretion with long term, how that fits in for the long haul for Devon. We're a 50-year-old company. We're not a 5-year-old company. And we have to be really, really thoughtful about that. And so we'll continue to look for opportunities, but we're going to maintain that discipline. And at the end of the day, we have a deep, deep resource base. And I think that's something that is incumbent upon this management team that we have to continue to drive home and we have to demonstrate not only how we execute, hitting numbers, exceeding whatever that is, but we just have to do a wonderful job in working with the outside community, outside investors on the resource that we have in-house currently."", 'Scott Michael Hanold', 'And regionally, is there an area you focus a little bit more time on? Is it Permian, Bakken, Eagle Ford, like are all areas of focus?', 'Richard E. Muncrief', ""I think for us, we're going to stick to our strategy. It's real simply put. We want to stay as oily as we can for as long as we can. And I think we're seeing that play out in real time with -- I'm not sure we got where gas prices are as we sit here this morning again, but it's up $2. That's not a good spot to be in. And so for us, we want to stay as oily and as liquid rich as we possibly can because throughout the entirety of my career, that's been the place to go. Now we're all -- I think we all are optimistic about what the future of natural gas could be. And we spent quite a bit of time in DC talking about the importance of tone, the importance of consistency with some of our public policy, those sorts of things, and then our foreign trade policies.And so we -- so for us, I think, near term, to answer your question, we're going to be very interested in oil-prone basins. Oil is going to drive the margins for the foreseeable future, and that's kind of where we want to be."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.', 'Charles Arthur Meade', ""Rick, I want to ask a question about your Delaware Basin completion crews. And more specifically, if you could give us a sense of the composition of the 4 fleets you're running right now, whether those are all zipper fracs or whether there's any (inaudible) crews in there? And -- and we're in the bigger sense, where I'm going with this, has there been any thought or is there any possibility of adjusting that mix to -- so that you're more on a steady state program there?"", 'Richard E. Muncrief', ""I'm going to let Clay answer the balance of that. But just in real time, just yesterday, I was talking to our -- one of our completion managers down there and we're picking up the fourth crew, as we mentioned, but the 3 that have been out there, the -- it's incredible, Charles, on the efficiencies and what we're doing out there. The number of stages -- and it's interesting, there's -- we're -- it's healthy competition between the team members and certain of the companies that are involved with it and we're actively comparing and contrasting ways that we can get better and better. And at the end of the day, we want to make sure that we do this very, very safely and efficiently. And so we're constantly changing. Every pad has its unique characteristics. But I can tell you that more and more, we just see these efficiencies that are just incredible.And things that just 12 months ago, we knew that you'd see some efficiencies, but we're exceeding some expectations. Clay, why don't you maybe (inaudible)."", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Sure. I'll follow up, Charles. We have more simul frac coming -- we're completing today, and more to come throughout the year and go forward. One of the challenges of simul frac, you really need to plan that 12 or 18 months ahead when you're planning the well site location, how many wells on 1 particular location, because that enables more ability to do some of that. So about 12 months ago, we started really kind of leaning in, building a little bit larger number of wells per pad instead of separate pads. That allows more simul frac opportunity, which we're seeing great results, and we're continuing to benefit from.We're also testing some very interesting things where we artificially tie pads together with some big lines between the 2. So there's some really creative stuff. But again, it's a little below the radar typically of what we talk about on earnings calls. But I can tell you that the teams are doing just amazing work and really adding material value through these efficiencies to the bottom line of Devon. So really appreciate the great work there."", 'Charles Arthur Meade', ""Got it. And then, Clay, I want to go back to your prepared comments, you were talking about -- I think I heard you talk about some additional landing zones in the Wolfcamp B, I'm not sure I kind of -- I caught it all when you were talking about it. So I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on that and perhaps including your answer, an indication, is this something that you're going to be -- that you're working into the '24 program? Or is this an out-year sort of project?"", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""Yes. I think sometime last year, we're deep in the penalty box. We talked about the highlights of some of the great work that the team did around understanding the Wolfcamp B. Now that work is manifesting and more of that be coming to kind of that front end of the priority list, really competitive, super accretive, and we're incorporating that landing zone into some of the development that we have during the course of '24 and beyond. And so here's how I would characterize it. This is landing zones that we knew were viable. We needed to test, we needed to understand, we needed to try some different configurations to really find the best approach. During the course of '23 -- '22 and '23, we did that. We optimized a development approach. And now in '24, we're benefiting from some of that.So again, it probably was lost in some of the shuffle last year, but this is work that we did during the course of '23 that we're significantly benefiting from. This expands what I would consider some of our really Tier 1 runway. It's stuff that was a little further out in the priority on a risk basis as we derisked it what it really has moved to the front of the pack, and we're really excited about the continued good work there."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen.', 'David Adam Deckelbaum', ""Rick or Clay, I wanted to ask just, you talked about, Rick, obviously or Clay, the total dollar amount for the Delaware actually coming down this year, it looks like you're still obviously growing that asset. You guided obviously to a slight decline, I guess, at a corporate level. I'm wondering, when you think about capital allocation, should we be consistently thinking about the Delaware as a growth asset over the next several years, given the visibility that you have now where you can be allocating capital to within that basin?"", 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""I think it's -- I would put it in the same category as Devon. We are a low growth kind of 0% to 5%. Delaware will play a certain role. Some quarters, some years, it's going to be a little bit of a tick up. Others, it's going to be relatively flat. But I wouldn't think of it as a standout growth asset. We're really pleased with the year-over-year performance. As I mentioned, it did grow. We also were able to build a few extra DUCs during the course of the second half of last year that we were able to capture the benefit of in the first half of this year. So there's kind of that going on in the background. But I wouldn't say it's materially out of step with overall Devon or with the other basins."", 'Richard E. Muncrief', ""David, it's Rick. I will add that when we talk about it being flat to up slightly in the Delaware, that's on the oil side. And as you think about an improving -- structurally improving gas and NGL structure, you will see growth there. So I think you can look at it from an equivalent standpoint, it is a growth basin and it's going to continue to be. That's what drove a lot of our 8% growth as a company last year. And so I think you're going to see that continue to play out.That's not only true of us. That's true of the entire Permian Basin, whether it's on the Midland side or the Delaware side, you're going to continue to see gas production, NGL production continue to grow even in a flat oil scenario."", 'David Adam Deckelbaum', ""And maybe just, Rick, one of the, I guess, other parts of the capital budget that continues to grow every year, albeit still small as carbon capital. In a world where you're trying to enhance returns of capital to shareholders, could you kind of contextualize how you see that spend generating returns for Devon as a whole and why that's sort of seeing a larger piece of the pie this year, albeit small?"", 'Richard E. Muncrief', ""Yes. I think it's a really good question, and it's a really important topic for us, only is Devon, but as an industry, and it's something we're going to stay ahead of. We have changing regulations. Devon wants to make sure that we stay ahead of the curve. And these regulations are coming at us quickly. What a lot of people don't understand is some of these regulations coming are so onerous that many of the low-volume wells that we have across this nation are going to end up being plugged. And so you're going to see oil and natural gas wells that basically are stripper wells, as we always refer them to that are such low volume. They just, quite honestly, cannot -- it cannot afford to spend capital on. And it's just -- it's going to be a fact of life. And so there are studies by API and some of the other trade groups talk about that impact, but it is real. So what Devon wants to do, we want to make sure that we're ahead of the curve, as I said, and it's something that we'll -- I think you'll see over time is going to continue to creep up for the next 2 or 3 years. We want to be very thoughtful about that and prudent with it and strategic about it. But it is something to -- that we all just have to deal with. It's a fact of life."", 'David Adam Deckelbaum', 'And just for my own edification, is that capital being earmarked for projects that would allow you to prolong production on some of these wells such as increasing methane capture? Or is this capital associated were tied to plugging and abandoning some of those wells that would be more regulatory headaches?', 'Clay M. Gaspar', ""David, what I would characterize most of it is, is retrofitting existing facilities with better designs to lower emissions. And by the way, keep us well ahead of this coming regulation wave. So you could look at this out of necessity. I think we're half a click ahead. We try and stay well ahead of just necessity. But these are regulations that we will always make sure that we are staying in front of to continue to reserve our important rights as an organization to provide energy to fuel the world. So thanks again for the question, David."", 'Scott Coody', ""Well, looks like we've run a little bit past time here. So I appreciate everyone's interest in Devon's Day. And if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team at any time. Have a good day, everyone."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.""]"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] This call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Coody, vice president of investor relations.', 'Sir, you may begin.', 'Scott Coody -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. Last night, we issued an earnings release and presentation that covered Devon's results for the past year and our outlook for 2024. Throughout the call today, we will make references to the earnings presentation to support prepared remarks, and these slides can be found on our website.

The Stock Advisor service has\xa0more than tripled\xa0the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.', 'See the 10 stocks', '*Stock Advisor returns as of February 26, 2024', ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick."", 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey. Thank you, Scott, and I appreciate everyone taking time to join us this morning. For today, my comments will be centered on four key themes: Devon's accomplishments in 2023, the catalyst of our improved outlook for 2024, the depth of the resource we possess in our portfolio, and the strategic priorities that will drive our free cash flow allocation going forward. Now, beginning with the fourth quarter, we exited the year with a solid quarter of execution, highlighted by production that exceeded the top end of guidance, beating consensus across all products."", 'Disciplined reinvestment resulted in our 14th consecutive quarter of free cash flow, and we took steps to increase cash returns by stepping up the pace of our stock buyback. These positive results rounded out another successful year for Devon where we achieved several key milestones that I am extremely proud of. On Slide 7, you can see we delivered production growth rate of 8% in 2023, resulting in new high all-time production for oil. This healthy growth rate was also paired with returns on capital employed that outpaced the S&P 500 by a substantial margin for the third straight year.', 'With the free cash flow our business produced, we rewarded shareholders with an impressive cash return yield of around 10% that was balanced between buybacks and dividends. As I touched on during the last call, our team has done a great job of designing a plan to deliver improved capital efficiency in 2023 -- excuse me, 2024. With the current industry conditions, we still believe it is prudent to deploy a steady capital program designed to optimize returns while maintaining volumes around levels where we exited 2023. Importantly, we expect to deliver this production for 10% less capital versus last year, funded at a WTI break-even price of around $40.', 'In conjunction with this outlook and given the confidence that we have in the underlying health of our business, the board has approved a 10% increase to our fixed dividend payout. Now, looking briefly at the trajectory of our capital and production profile in 2024 on Slide 9, we plan to be spending -- to be slightly elevated in the first half of the year due to the addition of a fourth completion crew in the Delaware Basin. Due to timing of completions and recent curtailments from extreme winter weather, we expect first quarter production to be the lowest quarter of the year. However, we expect volumes and capital efficiency to move higher over the remainder of the year.', ""In 2024, a key contributor to our improved capital efficiency will be the well productivity improvements we expect to achieve in the Delaware Basin. Turning to Slide 12. And with the easing of constraints across the basin, we plan to concentrate roughly 70% of the Delaware's capital in New Mexico while optimizing the remaining activity across our acreage in Texas. This allocation to New Mexico is meaningfully higher than what we were able to deploy during 2023 and is more in line with our historic activity in the basin."", 'Overall, this refined capital allocation is expected to increase well productivity in the Delaware by up to 10% on a year-over-year basis. Given that two-thirds of our Delaware Basin inventory is in New Mexico, we anticipate being able to sustain our pace of activity on both sides of the Stateline for the foreseeable future. With this advantaged acreage footprint, you can see on Slide 14 that we have one of the largest inventories among operators in the basin, providing us with a multidecade resource that will drive our enterprisewide performance for many years to come. The quality of our Delaware-weighted resource base, combined with our disciplined strategy, positions us to generate a differentiated amount of free cash flow for many years to come.', ""As you can see on Slides 15 and 16, our business is set to deliver a free cash flow yield that is up to three times that offered by the broader markets. With this free cash flow, we are targeting a cash return payout of around 70%, while earmarking the remainder to further strengthen our balance sheet. With our flexible cash return framework, we will judiciously allocate our free cash flow toward the best opportunity, whether that be buybacks or dividends. Given that the equity market is heavily discounting valuations in the energy sector, it's an easy decision to prioritize a buyback over the variable dividend to capture the incredible value that Devon offers at these historically low valuations."", ""And Slide 19 helps better visualize this compelling value proposition. On the right, you can see energy represents less than 4% of the S&P 500 while contributing more than 10% of the EBITDA in 2023. This is noteworthy given the energy's S&P weighting historically tracks its earnings contribution over time. I believe this gap exists due to extreme valuations in tech, combined with a pervasive misunderstanding of hydrocarbon demand over time."", ""With global energy demand forecasted to increase 50% by 2050, the world is going to need growth from all sources of energy, including oil and natural gas. With the world's power needs continuing to grow, it is evident that peak oil demand is nowhere in sight and our industry will be an important contributor of energy growth for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, high-quality names like Devon provide significant equity upside over time as you collect outside -- outsized cash returns. And as I said earlier, this is why we are putting our money to work actively repurchasing shares."", ""And with that, I'll turn the call over to Clay."", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', 'Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. The Devon team did a really good job of rounding out 2023 by exceeding our operational targets for the fourth quarter. These positive results were driven by three key factors: number one, improved uptime, driving base production; number two, increased efficiencies through faster cycle times, resulting in lower capital per well; and number three, better new well productivity, improving our wedge production volume. Slide 5 provides a good visual of these favorable operating trends.', ""The chart on the left highlights the efficiencies we've delivered in our drilling and completions operations. On the right, you can see this track record of efficiency gains is also paired with some of the best well productivity of any producer in the U.S. While these results can certainly vary from quarter to quarter, our consistency over time demonstrates the quality of our assets and execution capabilities. The most significant contributor to this advantaged capital efficiency was our franchise asset in the Delaware Basin."", 'In the fourth quarter, roughly 60% of our capital was deployed to this prolific basin, allowing us to run a consistent program of 16 rigs. This activity -- with this activity, we brought online 62 new wells, grew productivity 6% year over year, and expanded our DUC inventory, allowing us to add a fourth completion crew earlier this year. While we had strong results across our acreage position in the quarter, the top contributors to our performance were several large pads within our Cotton Draw and Stateline areas. At Cotton Draw, in the core of the basin, we brought on 11 three-mile laterals that showcased the stacked-pay potential and prolific rates this area can deliver.', 'These extended-reach wells were diversified across five different producing intervals in the Avalon, Bone Spring, and Wolfcamp formations. In aggregate, the oil-weighted production from these wells achieved 30-day rates of 4,400 BOE per day, with impressive per-well recoveries trending as high as 4 million BOE. In addition to the high rates at Cotton Draw, we also delivered record-setting drilling and completion times. This performance included a record completion pace of 3,100 feet per day, and drilling times for these three-mile laterals came in as low as 19 days, with the final mile drilled in a record time of just over 24 hours.', 'Another standout performance during the quarter and possibly my favorite in terms of naming convention was our Clawhammer Project in the Stateline area. Clawhammer was named by a geologist after the style of playing the banjo that his dad used in their family jam sessions. The good news for him and his family is that these wells are fantastic. This eight-well pad consists of two-mile laterals co-developed in multiple intervals in the Wolfcamp A.', 'With production rates averaging 3,900 BOE per day, this package of wells delivered the highest well productivity per lateral foot of any project during the quarter. As I look ahead to 2024, I expect another big year for the Delaware Basin as we have a great slate of projects lined up. We plan to bring online around 215 wells for the year, with most of the capital deployed toward the best parts of our acreage in southern Lea and Eddy counties and the Stateline area of Texas. This plan is designed to deliver improved capital efficiency and better well productivity through the full column of development of the Upper Wolfcamp, along with select landing zones in the Wolfcamp B, where applicable.', ""The de-risking of multiple targets in the Wolfcamp B over the past year has allowed us to pursue more extensive multizone developments in 2024, bolstering our high-quality inventory, delivering higher net present value for project, and still delivering exceptional rates of return. Turning to Slide 13. To build upon Rick's comments from earlier, we're confident in our ability to deploy more capital to the core of the Delaware because of a long list of improvements in infrastructure. These improvements include 2 Bcf a day of processing additions -- gas processing additions, expansions to the downstream gas takeaway, enhanced water handling capabilities with our WaterBridge joint venture, build-out of gathering and compression, and investment in self-generated power and microgrids to increase the reliability of the electrical infrastructure."", ""With these improvements, we are very well positioned to execute on our 2024 plan. In fact, year to date, we're delivering at a pace ahead of schedule, allowing us to fully offset the winter weather downtime we experienced in January across the field. Shifting to the Eagle Ford. The successful integration of our Validus acquisition was one of the key drivers of the production increase of 56% during 2023."", 'With our enhanced scale in the basin, the team did a great job of capturing synergies by driving improvements across each phase of our operations. This progress can be seen through several indicators, including year-over-year 15% decrease in production costs, a 30%-plus improvement in completion cycle times over the course of the year, and we set a company record spud rig release of only five days. Our activity during the year continued to demonstrate that the Eagle Ford provides one of the most promising opportunities for resource upside in the U.S. shale.', ""Through tighter redevelopment spacing and refracs, our capital program not only replenished but expanded our risk resource in the play to an inventory runway of around 10 years at today's pace of activity. Looking to 2024, our key focus for the Eagle Ford team is to sharpen capital efficiency by incorporating appraisal learnings from the past year, along with a more balanced activity across Dewitt and Karnes counties. This plan is expected to deliver single-digit production growth for roughly $75 million less capital over last year. In the Rockies, we possess a unique combination of assets that can provide both growth and free cash flow."", 'Specifically in the Powder River Basin, we are building upon the well productivity improvements achieved over the past couple of years where the average six-month queues increased nearly 20% from historic levels. A recent highlight was the [Inaudible] 3x well, which reached peak rates in Q4. This three-mile Niobrara well achieved initial production rates greater than 1,500 BOE per day, with an 85% oil cut, and then hung in at that rate for quite a while. In addition to the strong oil productivity, the [Inaudible] attained a record drilling performance of 1,350 feet per day, a 45% improvement compared to the average Niobrara well.', 'In 2024, our efforts will be focused on refining spacing, reducing costs, and continuing to ready this asset for full development in later part of this decade. In the Williston, I want to thank the team for safely working through the incredibly severe winter storm weather that we experienced in January and rapidly restoring effective production. As I look into 2024, our focus for this asset will be to optimize base production, deploy selective investments to high-confidence projects, and harvest $300 million of field-level cash flow. So far this year, our capital program is off to a great start with our bull moose project maxing out our production facilities at over 15,000 barrels of oil per day, with several of the wells flowing 3,000 barrels per day or more during their flowback.', ""Lastly, I'd like to briefly cover our activity in the Anadarko Basin, where we delivered an 8% production growth rate during 2023. The three-rig drilling program funded by our Dow joint venture delivered very impressive well production. The value of these -- this production was also enhanced by our ability to route volumes into the premium southeast gas markets and by the team driving operational costs 10% lower. In 2024, we plan to maintain a similar pace of drilling activity in the Anadarko, with a keen focus on developing the liquids-rich window of the play, where returns from our joint venture activity will benefit from higher condensate cuts."", ""And with that, I'll turn the call to Jeff for financial review. Jeff."", 'Jeff Ritenour -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Clay. I'll spend my time today discussing the highlights of our financial performance in 2023 and the priorities for our free cash flow as we head into 2024. Beginning with our fourth quarter financial performance, Devon's operating cash flow totaled $1.7 billion, exceeding consensus estimates, and represents the highest quarterly total of the year. This cash flow comfortably funded our capital spending and resulted in $827 million of free cash flow, driving full year free cash flow to $2.7 billion."", ""Even in the face of headwinds from lower commodity prices, this level of free cash flow ranks as one of the highest in Devon's 50-year-plus history. Another powerful example of the consistent financial results our disciplined strategy can deliver. As Rick touched on earlier, with this free cash flow, we're targeting a cash return payout of 70%, with the remainder of reserve for balance sheet improvement. Slide 23 in the appendix is a good exhibit representing how we allocated our cash returns in the most recent quarter."", ""Given the compelling valuation of our equity, we prioritize share repurchases over the variable dividend. This resulted in us repurchasing 5.2 million shares in the fourth quarter at a total cost of $234 million. In 2024, we've continued to actively acquire shares through our 10b5-1 program, and we plan to supplement this with systematic buying with open market purchases during the year. With plenty of runway remaining on our $3 billion buyback authorization, we see Devon's current valuation as a great opportunity to compound the per-share growth for our investors."", ""In addition to our buyback activity, we delivered investors an attractive stream of income through our fixed plus variable dividend framework. In the fourth quarter, we declared a dividend payout of $0.44 per share that is payable at the end of March. This dividend consists -- consist of the board's approval to increase the fixed dividend by 10% to $0.22 per share and declare a variable distribution of $0.22 per share. We continue to believe dividends are a great way to reward shareholders and are a critical contributor to total returns over time."", ""We also believe that the flexibility designed into our dividend framework allows us to return meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash to shareholders across a variety of market conditions through the cycle. Moving to the balance sheet. Devon's investment-grade financial position continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter with cash balances increasing by $144 million to a total of $875 million. In addition to our strong liquidity, we exited the year with low leverage, marked by a net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.7 times."", 'Looking ahead, with the excess free cash flow that accrues to our balance sheet, we plan to build liquidity and retire maturing debt. Our next debt maturity comes due in September of this year, totaling $472 million, and we will have the opportunity to retire another $485 million of notes in 2025. So, in summary, our financial strategy is working well. We have successfully scaled our business to consistently generate free cash flow.', ""We are boosting per-share results by opportunistically repurchasing our shares. We offer a dividend yield that far exceeds that of the broader markets. And the balance sheet is in great shape, with a clear pathway of continued improvement over the next few years. With that, I'll turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments."", 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Jeff. So, to wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to reinforce a few key messages. Number one, Devon is a great company that has created a tremendous amount of value for shareholders since we unveiled our industry-first cash return strategy announced in 2020. Since that time, we've deployed $13 billion to dividends, buybacks, debt reduction, and accretive acquisitions."", ""I'm extremely proud of this accomplishment, but we're just getting started. 2024 is setting up to be another wonderful year for Devon. By incorporating learnings from the past year and refining our capital allocation, we expect to deliver a step-change improvement in capital efficiency this year. This improved capital efficiency is anchored by our assets in the Delaware Basin, where we expect to deliver the powerful combination of improved well productivity for much lower capital cost."", ""Our long-duration resource base, underpinned by the Delaware, is one of the deepest of any company out there. The resource quality provides us an advantaged platform to drive attractive per-share growth and outsized cash returns for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott, and let's have some Q&A."", 'Scott Coody -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""Thanks, Rick. We'll now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. This allows us to get to more of your questions on the call today."", ""With that operator, we'll take our first question."", '', 'Operator', 'Perfect. Thank you. [Operator instructions] We do have our first question registered. It comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.', 'Neil, your line is now open.', 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Thank you very much, Rick and team. Rick, I know, over the last year, you've talked about some of your frustration around execution on the oil volume side, that this is going to be an important year for that operational inflection. It does seem like we're seeing some evidence of that with capital efficiency and holding the 315 oil guide."", ""So, maybe you could just give us your perspective on whether we're at that inflection point from an ops perspective?"", 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""You know, Neil, that's a good question. You know, we have expressed our frustration, I think, in the market, really. You know, we really traded down on some of our variances we saw last year in our production volumes. But even though they were minor, that the -- from a volumetric standpoint, they weren't from a stock performance standpoint."", ""So, I think this setup is really good for investors as we look forward. So, it is going to be, I believe, a point of inflection for us, as we -- as we've mentioned. We're really bullish about our performance. The team has done a wonderful job getting us through some tough weather."", ""We've seen some increased productivity. I think Clay went through the assets really well. And we're seeing nice growth on the oil side coming out of the -- out of this -- the first quarter as we enter second, third, fourth quarters of this year. And I'll also say, Neil, I feel really good about the next several years on our ability to keep crude volumes where they're at."", ""I think that it's -- we're still early. We still are not getting what I think is a strong, strong signal for demand. But when that call comes, I think we'll be ready to step up for it. But really feel good about the trends we're seeing."", 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Yeah. And just maybe to build on this, this might be a question for Clay, but just can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of well productivity that gives you confidence in your ability to hit or exceed that 315 oil number this year?"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks for the question, Neil. You know, this is one of the frustrating things about a publicly traded company. We get to see what's coming, we get to see what's happening well before the market does."", ""And so, where I can see the improvement internally in the well productivity from the first half of last year to the second half of last year, those numbers are just starting to hit the public markets and through the public sources. And so, I think that's, you know, pretty evident for those that are paying attention that this is not at first quarter '24, we decided to turn on the production. This is an evolution. We wanted to make some really thoughtful investments in the future of the company."", ""We did that. The market, I believe, responded pretty vigorously to that. We've since made some changes in the planning, the well delivery. The well performance has really significantly taken an uptick."", ""As I mentioned, even late last year, you see some of that coming through the public sources. We're going to -- it's really going to manifest in 2024. And as Rick mentioned, we're just off to a really good start, even recovering from a pretty severe storm that we saw somewhere 1% to 2% impact. You know, we always bake in winter weather, but an event like that was pretty out of the norm."", ""The productivity of the wells, the performance, we've been able to overcome that, and we feel really good about delivering -- being able to deliver the '24 full year numbers."", 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'All right. Thanks, Clay. Thanks, Rick.', 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Neil.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from J.P. Morgan. Arun, your line is now open.', 'Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. Rick and Clay, you've highlighted your expectations to deliver up to 10% well productivity gains in the Delaware Basin. I was wondering if you could maybe help us -- provide more details on what is driving that."", ""Sounds like there's going to be some high grading for Monument Draw to southeast in New Mexico. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's driving that and if completion optimization is also a driver of better year-over-year productivity."", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Thanks for the question, Arun. I think both things come into play. You know, the big headline thing is just a refocus to more where we've historically allocated our capital, kind of in the core of the basin, predominantly where our inventory and our portfolio lays out between New Mexico and Texas. I would say, '23, especially first half of '23, was a little bit of an anomaly on where we were allocating that capital, and we needed to do some work from the infrastructure standpoint, but also really understanding where all these fit together."", ""We're benefiting tremendously from that work, from that infrastructure build-out, and that's where we're seeing the improvement really late '23 to what we're showing today. On the completions questions, I wouldn't point to -- it's a big knob that we've changed on -- excuse me, like a sand concentration or how we're doing what we're doing. But the team is working every single day to think about how do we do it better, how do we touch a little bit more rock, and how do we do it more cost-effectively. And I can tell you, we're winning on all fronts."", ""These are small wins at this point. It's a relatively mature way of thinking about these assets, but really, really pleased with the continued improvement there. And that shows up in the numbers as well."", 'Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Quick follow-up. Rick, you know, Devon, as you know, has been linked to a few M&A deals in the financial press. I was wondering if you could just comment on where we -- where you sit today in terms of your A&D strategy and how you gauge some of the inorganic opportunities versus, as Jeff mentioned, you know, the ability to buy back your stock at a 9% kind of free cash flow yield today?', 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, very good question. You know, Arun, our answer has really not changed that much over the last several years. We're going to continue to evaluate opportunities. You know, when you're in five basins, you have some great opportunities in all five of those, and we watch that, we stay attuned to those opportunities as they, you know, come available or it's the right time for us to think about that."", ""You know, I don't -- so I think we're going to continue to see the high bar. We're going to -- it's got to be -- it has to have some accretion. It has to have the industrial logic that we have always talked about. And it just has to make us a better company."", ""And if it's -- if it fits, you know, in that framework, you know, man, I think that's our job is to create value for shareholders. And so, we're going to do that. We also have been advocates for consolidation. I think some of the transactions that's been announced that I think that they're -- I think they're positive for the industry, and it just shows that we are a depleting industry."", ""And so, you always have to replenish -- that's -- you know, your portfolio that's not changed. It's not changed since, you know, the beginning of this industry. And so, we'll always be active. We've got a great team."", ""We've got great analytics capabilities in-house. And we do our own internal analytics, compare that with what you see on the public market and adjust. But once again, we're going to be very, very measured, very disciplined, and we will make some -- I think, the right decisions. That does include buying our stock back because I can tell you that at these levels, we are very, very attractive."", 'But great question.', 'Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thanks, guys.', 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Arun.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Nitin Kumar from Mizuho. Nitin, your line is now open.', 'Nitin Kumar -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Rick, I've heard you say and just say multiple times today that, you know, buybacks are very attractive, especially at these levels."", 'But as I look at fourth quarter, the mix actually favors dividends, including the variable payout a bit. Not to nitpick or anything like that, but just want to understand, you know, what drove the decision. We applaud the 10% increase in the base dividend, but what drove the decision for the variable dividend and how should we see that evolve in 2024?', 'Jeff Ritenour -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Hey, Nitin. This is Jeff. Keep in mind that there is some variance in the timing of the variable dividend payout, right? So, when we announce it, it actually gets paid in the subsequent quarter. So, maybe that's what you're alluding to as it relates to the mix."", ""But, you know, with our framework going forward, we're going to simply each quarter focus on delivering about 70% of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of that fixed dividend, which, obviously, we grew at 10% here on a year-over-year basis. That's the first and foremost. Going to be a priority for us. And we're going to look to continue to grow that on an annual basis going forward."", ""Then beyond that, we're absolutely biased toward leaning in on the share repo here in the near term. And frankly, the variable dividend will fall out of the back of that based on that 70% threshold that I hit on earlier. So, we're going to continue to expect to have a higher mix of buyback going forward, and that's going to be our priority as we walk it through this year."", 'Nitin Kumar -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks, Jeff. And then my next question was really for Clay, probably. Clay, impressive improvements in operating efficiencies, you know, days drilled, days completed.', 'Just curious, is there any specific technology that you would point to that have helped you achieve those? And I just -- you know, never say never, but where are we in terms of those efficiencies? Are we getting to some sort of baseline or do you think we can continue to deliver those type of improvements?', 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Nitin, it really goes down -- goes back to just the core operating team. These are highly talented, highly motivated individuals that are absolutely trying to do the right thing ultimately for the shareholders they work for. Now, I will remind you, this is the same team working just as hard with just as much creativity this year as they were last year. What we've found is we really needed to focus -- we underestimated what a slight change in capital efficiency during the first half of '23 meant to investors."", ""I think that was way over-extrapolated into us running out of inventory. Not being able to do this anymore, we lost our minds, all that good fun. And what we showed is like hang on one second, we still have the capabilities. We've got some really impressive inventory, some great quality."", ""And importantly, these are hardworking impressive people that continue to find a way to do it better each quarter. And this is so many things below the radar that don't always show up in -- in the -- in various data or don't show up in the financials. I can tell, you we're winning on lots and lots of fronts, and there's more of that to come. So, really excited about the go forward."", ""I think we've got some good transparency in our slides on quantity of resource, quality of resource. I expect in '24 that we'll regain a little bit of public mojo. But, you know, that, to me, is just a -- it's a little overdue. So, looking forward to sharing that win with the team."", 'Nitin Kumar -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks, guys.', 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Nitin.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug, your line is now open.', 'Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Kalei on for Doug. So, thanks for getting me on.', ""For my first question, I want to go back to the buyback, just to follow up. I want to understand the motivations behind the strategy for '24. Shifting capital back to the Delaware and the margin is obviously an efficiency shift and that makes sense. But in tandem, you're also leaning back into the buyback, and that looks rather intentional."", 'So, can you talk about why you see the buyback as the preferred allocation today and why has that changed over the past several months?', 'Jeff Ritenour -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, you bet. So, again, on the buyback front, you know, it's pretty clear to us as we kind of walk through our framework for evaluating share repo, you know, versus the other capital allocation opportunities that we have, whether it be organic investment, inorganic investment that Rick spoke to earlier, whether it's M&A or otherwise. And then when we step back and look at the valuation, you know, we look at the multiples, we look at our intrinsic value model that we keep in-house, you know, and run multiple sensitivities on that. Every which way we turn, what we keep coming back to is the -- our shares look undervalued, you know, relative to the broader market, relative to the sector, and certainly relative to the results that we expect to post as we walk our way through this year."", ""So, that really has been the driver and our focus, you know, going back to the back half of last year and as we walk into 2024. And that's why we're biased toward having the lion's share of our cash returns be focused on the share repurchase going forward."", 'Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', '[Inaudible]', 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', 'And if I could, I just want to -- this is Clay. I want to add one --', 'Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Go ahead.', 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""I'm sorry. I just want to add one comment on that prior question. I think it's a common misconception the way we lay the numbers out that we are leaning in or that we're increasing capital to the Delaware somehow accelerating. That's not really the case."", ""We are the same rig count, same level of activity. The capital is actually coming down, not just in the total company, but in Delaware. But where we're seeing the 10% inflection from the company is really a reduction in some of the other areas. So, proportionately, Devon -- Delaware is moving up, but on an absolute basis, we're not consuming that inventory any faster than we had in '23 or years before."", 'Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Got it. I appreciate that, and that's where my follow-up will go. So, I'm wondering if the reduction in the capital in these other areas, what kind of permanence does that have? Is it sort of a stopgap until you figure out what's going on in the Bakken or is this now the direction of the program?"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', 'Was the question permanence?', 'Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Yeah. The permanence of the capital allocation.', 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', 'Permanence, meaning how long --', 'Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Yes.', 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Can we do it for multiple years? I'm just making sure I understand the question."", 'Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Yes. How many years can you run this kind of capital program?', 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', 'OK.', 'Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""What's optimum --"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""All right. Thank you for that. Sorry. The acoustics in here weren't quite right."", ""So, sorry about that. Yeah, you know, I think in pulling back the activity, for example, on the Williston Basin, that prolongs that basin's opportunity to continue to deliver free cash flow and offset some of that fall-in in production with some really healthy wells. What we found is we were pushing a little too quickly, a little too much capital to that asset by having the multiple basins that we do. Having our franchise asset in the Delaware Basin, it allows us to take a little bit of pressure off that team."", ""It allows them to really make sure that all the ducks are in a row, ready for that next pad. And then selectively, we're going to fund those. And as you saw with the bull moose that I talked about on the call, these are phenomenal. These are awesome returns."", ""And we've got more of that to come."", 'Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thanks for the comments.', 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'You bet.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist. Neal, your line is now open.', 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Clay, my first question is probably for you. It's on your Delaware infrastructure and takeaway."", ""I'm just wondering, after adding so much -- I saw this slide where you talked about adding so much processing, gathering, compression, water. I'm just wondering now, are you all able to handle the continued notable upside that's going to come with the development plan or will there be a continued build-out?"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Neal, we feel really good about being able to effectively produce. Remember, we are really watching our flaring. We don't want to have unnecessary shut-ins. We are reliant on so many third parties."", ""We want to make sure that we had that runway ahead of these very prolific pads coming online. We want to make sure we have that. We do feel very confident in that today. And remember, it's not just, you know, our immediate wells, we've got some really high-quality offset operators that know what they're doing as well."", ""It's a phenomenal basin, and we have to make sure that all of that plays together very nicely, and so that we have the reliability in the infrastructure to bring these wells online and make sure we ultimately get them to market."", 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Makes sense. And then my second is just on the Eagle Ford specifically. Can you give details -- I think you talked about an 85 to 95 well planned.', ""I'm just wondering, will the focus here be on existing key areas like you're doing in the Del and just maybe talk about any improvements we should think about specifically in this area?"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Thanks for that question. I -- I'm really excited about the Eagle Ford. I -- you know, one of the things, unlike a lot of other areas, we've continued to test down spacing, tighter wells, subsequent wells. After the initial development has been done, bringing additional wells in, which is really not very favorable in most basins, it tends to work and continue to provide upside in the Eagle Ford."", ""Now, when you pair that with some of the refrac activity, we can actually feather in new wells, refrac some of the existing wells, and we're seeing phenomenal results. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are continuing to expand the runway there without any M&A dollars, without -- you know, just from the existing footprint, the opportunity set continues to expand. And these are very prolific, very accretive to the bottom line kind of numbers that we're really excited about."", 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'Great to hear. Thank you, all.', 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Neal.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kevin MacCurdy from Pickering Energy Partners. Kevin, your line is now open.', 'Kevin MacCurdy -- Pickering Energy Partners -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning. My first question is on the capital budget. We appreciate that the $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion range is a significant decrease year over year.', ""But if we look back at last year's budget, we noticed that the range is wider, both on absolute dollars and on percentage basis this year. I was wondering if you could provide any color on what might put you at the low end of that range versus the high end of the capital range. Is that driven more by deflation, turning lines, or midstream spend?"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Yeah, it's interesting, Kevin. You know, one of the first thing that comes to mind for me is the efficiency that I talked about on a couple of my slides. You guys know this very well. We've been at this game for quite a while."", ""Sometimes, that efficiency can pull more activity into the calendar year. Look, this is not our first rodeo. This is February. We're already watching that for the full year."", ""We're committed to this range. But if I had to think of what could cause us to kind of float to the upside, it's probably that kind of work where you're seeing more opportunities bring some of that activity from '25 into '24. I think on the downside, you know, there's -- we're early in the year. I think the supply chain deflation opportunities are still -- you know, we've got a 5% year over year kind of baked in."", ""I feel good about that. I feel very confident we're going to be able to deliver that. As the year plays out, you know, we really need to see where that changes over time. My current crystal ball doesn't see a lot of inflation, but there are certainly deflation opportunities in that number, and that potentially could allow us to float or float down to the lower end of that range."", 'Kevin MacCurdy -- Pickering Energy Partners -- Analyst', ""I appreciate the detail on that. And as a follow-up, the Eagle Ford had a strong production quarter, and it looks like the capex guidance for that asset is fairly consistent year over year. Can you talk about the production and capital efficiency outlook in the Eagle Ford and if there's any major changes between 2023 and 2024?"", 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey, Kevin. This is Rick. One of the things that I've been really proud of over the last 12 to 18 months is coming on the heels of the Validus acquisition, what we have been able to learn. It's a solid acreage."", ""It's -- I would say, it is second, certainly, to our Black Hawk acreage. But the thing about it that we need to remind investors of and analyst of is that on the Black Hawk acreage, it's a 50-50 joint venture with BPX. BPX operates the drilling and the completion of that. And what we felt, it was really from a -- not only a productivity increase, but also just a strategic perspective."", ""We thought it was imperative that we had an asset that we owned, that we did the drilling, that we did the completions on. The five-day well that Clay referenced a while ago, I can tell you, that absolutely exceeded anything that we had in our Validus, you know, development plan. So, when I look at that, I look -- now, we're having some very, very meaningful discussions with our joint venture partner there, and they're very constructive. And I think it's going to lead to even better performance over time in the Eagle Ford."", ""I'm really pleased with what we're seeing with the refrac program. It's going to continue to drive some -- I think some long-term sustainability down there that a lot of people, I think, are underestimating. So, I'll turn it over to Clay to add any additional color, but the Eagle Ford is an area, I can tell you, that we're very excited about."", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Yeah, thanks for those comments, Rick. I think that's spot on. Kevin, the only thing I wanted to add is I do show a relatively meaningful drop, probably about a 10% or so drop in capital, about $75 million, the rough number I had, from '23 to '24. And so -- and again, that's with single-digit production growth on top of that."", 'Now, there is some well mix in there. We have a joint venture partner on part of the assets. We own the rest. We operate kind of a normal fashion.', 'So, there is some change in mix. But from a capital efficiency standpoint, things are moving in the right direction, and we continue to see upside potential on this particular asset.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Scott, your line is now open.', 'Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Yes. Good morning. The 10% improvement in productivity that you forecast in the Permian is normalized on a 10,000-foot lateral. Is it going to be a step up in lateral length in the play as you refocus on the quarter or is that going to be rather consistent?', 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Scott, it's pretty consistent year over year. We're always trying to drill longer laterals. It's kind of the opportunity set in front of us. We're always -- we feel very confident in our ability to deliver three-mile laterals from a productivity, from an operational standpoint."", ""The land mix doesn't always allow for that. So, we're going to be north of two miles, but not too much north, and it will be fairly consistent year over year."", 'Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Got it. And then just a nuanced one on the 1Q guide. You know, last quarter, you provided that 305 of oil per day. Today, you're -- you're guiding for 640 with a 2% weather impact."", ""But 640 at, you know, a 48%-ish oil cut, you kind of still rounds maybe even slightly better than that 305 figure in last quarter. So, the question is, is the underlying trend in oil production slightly better and it's just being offset by a bigger weather impact, or is the weather risk, you know, that was incorporated in that original 305 guide kind of similar to what actually transpired?"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Scott, I don't think it's really the well mix. The -- we've got some wells coming on. The Williston wells are exceptionally high in oil cut. We'll continue to bring those in."", ""I think that's just working in our favor in that regard."", 'Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst', 'OK. Appreciate it. Thank you.', 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', 'Thank you, sir.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC. Scott, your line is now open.', 'Scott Hanold -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Thanks. If I can delve into the infrastructure a little bit more, you know, on Page 13, you obviously bucket, you know, three areas that you're focused on in terms of, you know, building support for the 2024 plan. You know, as you think about, you know, the Permian development over the next two, three, four years, like which area really are you focused most primarily on to make sure you're, you know, executing on the plan? Like where do you see the risk of the biggest constraint, I guess, is the question?"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Scott, is all of the above an option? No, I mean, seriously, if any one of these things gets constrained and you're dead in the water or at least constrained. And so, we worked really hard to not just build what is the best rate of return opportunity set in our portfolio, but we're very thoughtful about modeling our own infrastructure, even modeling third-party infrastructure if we don't feel that they do an adequate job. And then there's the occasional curveball where one of the third parties, maybe even in the electrification front, can't come through with their normal pace. We need to have enough flexibility, enough forethought, enough creativity to be able to solve some of those problems essentially for them."", 'So, one of the things I mentioned is building out more of our own electrical infrastructure. We have about 700 miles of electrical -- electric lines in our basin already. We generate some of our own power. We have our own microgrids.', ""And this is really taking the bull by the horns out of necessity because, otherwise, the local power providers were not going to be able to keep up. So, those are the kind of proactive steps that we really leaned in probably with double effort in '23 because some of these historical norms have really changed, and we wanted to make sure that we didn't just bring on a bunch of wells and then be abnormally constrained and have to answer questions about why our wells are so terrible. So, anyway, I feel really good about the work that we did in '23 that we continue to do in '24. But look, we're not out of the woods."", ""We continue to look at infrastructure needs in '26, '27, and '28. We're working with partners as best we can. And I really think we have a great runway ahead of us. But the team is always on caution to make sure that we are prepared for those unforeseen challenges."", 'Scott Hanold -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""OK. Thanks for that. And as my follow-up, it's going to be on M&A, and I was hoping to get a deeper sense of how you think about M&A. And it's really two parts."", ""One, you know, first, if you can comment on some of the recent deals that have been out there, you know, if you all participated in and, really, what was the gives and takes of why -- if you did, why Devon, you know, didn't win out? And the number two, you all mentioned, obviously, you're a multibasin player, but like when you think about like -- you know, does Devon have the scale right now that it would like? And if you were to add, would it be really most a Permian thing or, you know, are other of those basins open to more significant M&A for Devon?"", 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. It's Rick, I'll fill that one. Number one, I really like the scale that we currently have. We have a deep resource base across our five basins that we're in."", ""So, I feel really good about that. But we're always -- as I mentioned earlier, we're always going to be looking to be opportunistic, to add resource, to add investment opportunities, you know, at a reasonable value, at an attractive value for our shareholders. I think that's just really incumbent upon this management team to always being on the hunt there. That being said, we are going to be very disciplined."", ""Some of the recent transactions, I think, were -- that were out there, that were announced, when I look at the metrics on those, those were rich. They really were. And others, you know, there's been a couple of them, they were hats off, really nice deals that we certainly weren't participating in those processes, but good for them. And that's great."", ""Congratulations. But for us, I want to just continue to drive home the point, we're going to continue to be disciplined, and we have to balance short-term accretion with long term -- how that fits in for the long haul for Devon. You know, we're a 50-year-old company. We're not a five-year-old company."", ""And we have to be really, really thoughtful about that. And so, we'll continue to look for opportunities, but we're going to maintain that discipline. And at the end of the day, we have a deep, deep resource base. And I think that's something that is incumbent upon this management team that we have to continue to drive home, and we have to demonstrate not only how we execute hitting numbers, exceeding them, whatever that is, but we just have to do a wonderful job and working with the outside community, outside investors on the resource that we have in-house currently."", 'Scott Hanold -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'And then regionally, is there an area you focus a little bit more time on? Is it, you know, Permian, Bakken, Eagle Ford or like are all areas of focus?', 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""You know, I think, for us, we're going to stick to our strategy that's really simply put, we want to stay as oily as we can for as long as we can. I think we're seeing that play out in real time with -- I'm not sure we got more gas prices as we sit here this morning again, but it's sub-$2. That's not a good spot to be in. And so, for us, we want to stay as oily and as liquid-rich as we possibly can because, throughout the entirety of my career, that's been the place to go."", ""Now, we're all -- I think we all are optimistic about the future of natural gas could be. And, you know, we spend quite a bit of time in DC talking about the importance of tone, the importance of consistency with some of our public policy, those sorts of things, and in our foreign trade policies. And so, we -- so for us, I think, near term, to answer your question, we're going to be very interested in oil-prone basins. Oil is going to drive the margins for the foreseeable future, and that's kind of where we want to be."", 'Scott Hanold -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Thanks for the color.', 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'You bet.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Charles, you may proceed with your question.', 'Charles Meade -- Johnson Rice and Company -- Analyst', ""Good morning, Rick, Clay, and Jeff. Rick, I want to ask a question about your Delaware Basin completion crews, and more specifically, if you could give us a sense of the composition of the four fleets you're running right now, whether those are all zipper fracs or whether there's any simulfrac crews in there. And where -- in the bigger sense, where I'm going with this, has there been any thought or there's any possibility of adjusting that mix to -- so that you're more on a steady-state program there?"", 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I'm going to let Clay answer the balance of that. But, you know, just in real time, just yesterday, I was talking to one of our completion managers down there. And, you know, we're picking up the fourth crew, as we mentioned. But the three that have been out there, the -- it's incredible, Charles, on the efficiencies in what we're doing out there, the number of stages."", ""And it's interesting, there's a -- there's -- we're -- it's healthy competition, you know, between the team members and certain companies that are involved with it. And we're actively comparing and contrasting ways that we can get better and better. And at the end of the day, we want to make sure that we do this very, very safely and efficiently. And so, we're constantly changing."", ""Every bad has its unique characteristics. But I can tell you that, more and more, we just see these efficiencies that are just incredible. And things that, just 12 months ago, we knew that you'd see some efficiencies, but we're exceeding some expectations. Clay, won't you maybe [Inaudible]"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Sure. I'll follow up, Charles. We have more simulfrac coming -- we're completing today and more to come throughout the year and go forward. One of the challenges of simulfrac, you really need to plan that 12 or 18 months ahead when you're planning the well site location, how many wells on one particular location, because that enables more ability to do some of that."", ""So, about 12 months ago, we started really kind of leaning in. Building a little bit larger number of wells per pad instead of separate pads, that allows for more simulfrac opportunity, which we're seeing great results and we're continuing to benefit from. We're also testing some very interesting things where we artificially tie pads together with some big lines between the two. So, there's some really creative stuff."", ""But again, it's a little below the radar typically of what we talk about in earnings calls. But I can tell you that the teams are doing just amazing work and really adding material value through these efficiencies to the bottom line of Devon. So, really appreciate the great work there."", 'Charles Meade -- Johnson Rice and Company -- Analyst', ""Got it. And then, Clay, I want to go back to your prepared comments. You were talking about -- I think I heard you talk about some additional landing zones in the Wolfcamp B. I'm not sure I kind of -- I caught it all when you were talking about it."", ""So, I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on that and perhaps include in your answer an indication, is this something that you're going to be -- you know, that you're working into the '24 program or is this an out-year sort of project?"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Yeah, I think, sometime last year, when we were deep in the penalty box, we talked about the highlights of some of the great work that the team did around understanding the Wolfcamp B. Now, that work is manifesting and more of that B coming to kind of that front end of the priority list. Really competitive, super accretive. And we're incorporating that landing zone into some of the development that we have during the course of '24 and beyond."", ""And so, here's how I would characterize it. This is landing zones that we knew were viable. We needed to test, we needed to understand, we needed to try some different configurations to really find the best approach. During the course of '23 -- '22 and '23, we did that."", ""We optimized a development approach. And now, in '24, we were benefiting from some of that. So, again, it probably was lost in some of the shuffle last year, but this is work that we did during the course of '23 that we're significantly benefiting from. This expands what I would consider some of our really Tier 1 runway."", ""It's stuff that was a little further out in the priority, on a risk basis. As we de-risked it, boy, it really has moved to the front of the pack, and really excited about the continued good work there."", 'Charles Meade -- Johnson Rice and Company -- Analyst', 'Thanks for the added detail.', 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', 'You bet.', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen. David, your line is now open.', 'David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I appreciate the time. Rick or Clay, I wanted to ask just you talked about, Rick, obviously, the -- or Clay, the total dollar amount for the Delaware actually coming down this year. It looks like you're still obviously growing that asset."", ""You know, you guided, obviously, to a slight decline, I guess, at a corporate level. I'm wondering, you know, when you think about capital allocation, should we be consistently thinking about the Delaware as a growth asset over the next several years given the visibility that you have now where you can be allocating capital to within that basin?"", 'Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer', ""You know, I think it's -- I would put it in the same category as Devon. We are a low growth, kind of 0% to 5%. Delaware will play a certain role. Some quarters or some years, it's going to be a little bit of a tick-up."", ""Others, it's going to be relatively flat. But I wouldn't think of it as a standout growth asset. We're really pleased with the year-over-year performance. As I mentioned, it did grow."", ""We also were able to build a few extra DUCs during the course of the second half of last year that we're able to capture the benefit of in the first half of this year. So, there's kind of that going on in the background, but I wouldn't say it's materially out of step with overall Devon or with the other basins."", 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey, David. It's Rick. I'll -- I will add that, you know, when we talk about it being, you know, flat to up slightly in the Delaware, that's on the oil side. And as you think about an improving -- structurally improving gas and NGL structure, you will see growth there."", ""So, I think you can look at it from a -- from an equivalent standpoint, it is a growth basin, and it's going to going to continue to be. That's what drove a lot of our 8% growth as a company last year. And so, I think you're going to see that continue to play out. That's not only true of us."", ""That's true of the entire Permian Basin. Whether it's on the Midland side or the Delaware side, you're going to continue to see gas production, NGL production continue to grow, even in a flat oil scenario."", 'David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Thanks, Rick and Clay. And maybe, Rick, you know, one of the, I guess, other parts of the capital budget that continues to grow every year, albeit still small, is carbon capital. You know, in a world where you're trying to enhance returns of capital to shareholders, could you kind of contextualize how you see that spend generating returns for Devon as a whole and why that's sort of seeing a larger piece of the pie this year, albeit small?"", 'Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. You know, I think it's a really good question, and it's a really important topic for us, not only as Devon, but as an industry. And it's something we're going to stay ahead of. You know, we have a change in regulations."", ""Devon wants to make sure that we stay ahead of the curve. And these regulations are coming at us quickly. What a lot of people don't understand is some of these regulations coming are so onerous that many of the low-volume wells that we have across this nation are going to end up being plugged. And so, you're going to see oil and natural gas wells that basically are stripper wells that we always refer them to that are such low volume, they just, quite honestly, cannot -- they cannot afford to, you know, spend capital on."", ""And it's just -- it's going to be a fact of life. And so, there are studies by API and some of the other trade groups that talk about that impact, but it is real.

Thankfully, we decided to pass at the time in favor of what we believed to be a much better competitively positioned business with a much stronger track record of execution. Since then, issues at FIS have gone from bad to worse. The $48 billion acquisition of Worldpay in 2019, which took leverage up to 5.5x on the balance sheet, hasn’t turned out quite as well as Fiserv’s acquisition of First Data. Fast forward to today, and FIS is unwinding prior mistakes, selling off a 55% interest in the recently acquired business (meaning we now have a hard number for the remaining 45% they own), and using proceeds to take leverage back down to 2.5x post close while repurchasing at least $3.5B of stock through next year.

We wrote in October, after Shopify was our worst performer, that the stock had been volatile, despite the fact that the company’s underlying business has been “steadily improving following a post-Covid e-Commerce slowdown.” The most recent quarter, reported in early November, was a continuation of this steady recovery. Revenue growth of 25% was 3 percentage points better than investors expected and an acceleration over last year’s 3Q growth of 22%. More impressively, SHOP reported operating income margins of 16%, 600 basis points ahead of investor expectations. Free cash flow margins were also 16%, and the company guided 4Q free cash flow margins to the “high teens.” A combination of new merchants to the company’s platform, increased adoption of SHOP’s offerings by existing merchants, and e-commerce market share gains (SHOP merchants US sales on Black Friday grew 24% year over year vs US E-commerce in aggregate growing 7.5%) are driving this revenue growth and profitability.', 'Last year, 10% of US retail e-commerce sales flowed through SHOP, second only to Amazon, and the company is still enjoying significant tailwinds as retail merchants of all sizes adopt SHOP’s software tools to display, manage and sell their products across a dozen different sales channels.

Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information is presented in our earnings release. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Stephanie."", ""Stephanie Ferris: Thank you, George, and thank you everyone for joining us. 2023 was a year of significant positive momentum at FIS. When I stepped in as CEO, we were facing an uncertain economy, a banking crisis, inflation and a market where new capital was scarce. And while FIS was a statured company with over 50 years of market success, it had lost its focus in recent years. Simply put, the company was not meeting expectations. It was missing financial commitments and growth opportunities. It was slow in the delivery of products, too complex for clients to navigate and selling in areas that didn't contribute to the bottom-line. Fast-forward a year later, and we are now a much different company with renewed focus, vision and measurable results."", 'We took a decisive action and moved with urgency to put the company on a sustainable path for long-term success, unlocking value for shareholders and re-committing to our clients who are at the center of everything we do. In a short period of time, we successfully executed a number of significant operational commitments, while consistently delivering financial outcomes ahead of expectations. Earlier this month, we announced the successful completion of the majority sale of the Worldpay business to GTCR, a key milestone for our future. This landmark transaction creates two market-leading companies with greater strategic flexibility and operational focus to capitalize on their respective growth and margin opportunities in rapidly evolving markets.', ""FIS holds a meaningful 45% stake in Worldpay, and the two companies will continue to work together closely in the future. The strategic go-to-market partnership we established with Worldpay through our commercial agreements preserves the key value propositions for clients of both companies. And it is a powerful continuation of what we started when our two organizations first came together. Worldpay will remain an important distribution channel for FIS, while continuing to benefit from access to FIS' array of bank tech services such as our embedded finance solutions. We are excited to partner with Charles Drucker, the Worldpay management team and GTCR, and we are confident the business is on the right trajectory to reinvigorate revenue and earnings growth."", ""The separation reinforces FIS' position as a global enterprise software leader servicing the technology needs of the most complex global financial institutions, multinational corporates and governments. With a sharp focus on our marquee set of clients, we are well-positioned to capitalize on favorable industry trends and quickly push into faster-growing verticals and segments of the market. This builds on our first-mover technology advantages, allowing us to accelerate revenue growth as our 2024 outlook demonstrates. The Worldpay transaction also allows us to recapitalize our balance sheet, providing ample flexibility to reinvest in the business, while at the same time, accelerating capital returns to shareholders and lowering our leverage ratio."", ""I'm pleased to announce that we are once again raising our share repurchase target. We are now committing to buying back at least $3.5 billion of stock in 2024, up from our previous $3 billion target. Including repurchases completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, this brings our total share repurchase commitment up to at least $4 billion. This increased buyback reflects our confidence in the business, our strong capital position and our view on the intrinsic value of FIS' shares. Lastly, we continue to execute against our Future Forward strategy, exceeding our targets for 2023 and increasing our commitment for operational excellence in 2024. The program is changing the way FIS operates with a focus on driving greater efficiency, effectiveness and growth for our clients and for FIS."", ""Our successful efforts are underpinned by distinct and tangible proof points. For example, over the second half of 2023, we were able to return the company to year-over-year margin expansion. And, we expect to drive further profitability improvements in 2024. We refocused our sales force to prioritize higher-value, higher-margin technology sales, and we intensified our efforts to improve the customer experience, including accelerating implementations of our next-generation technology solutions. While there is still plenty of work to be done, I couldn't be prouder of the FIS team and what we've accomplished together in just a year's time. Now let's turn to a discussion of our financial results. Turning to Slide 6. The significant actions we undertook in 2023 are already driving improved financial outcomes."", 'We delivered full year 2023 financial results ahead of our outlook, including four consecutive quarters of outperformance on a total company basis. Adjusted revenue growth of 2% was driven by strong total company recurring revenue growth of 4%, including 5% recurring growth across our Banking and Capital Markets segments. Profitability improvements were primarily driven by our Future Forward program. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expanding over the second half of 2023 despite headwinds in high-margin non-recurring revenue such as license and termination fees. We meaningfully improved adjusted free cash flow conversion in 2023 to a normalized 95% as compared to 72% in 2022. Capital expenditures declined to approximately 8% of total company revenue in 2023, down from 9% in 2022 as a result of continued execution against Future Forward initiatives.', ""Lastly, we returned over $1.7 billion in capital to our shareholders through the combination of both dividends and share repurchases with over $800 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 7. The trajectory of our recurring revenue growth trends exiting the year and continued expense management gives us confidence that both revenue growth and profitability are inflecting in 2024. We expect a sustainable acceleration in adjusted revenue growth from 3% in 2023 to more than 4% in 2024. This acceleration is principally driven by a meaningful improvement in Banking's revenue growth from 2% in 2023 to at least 3% in 2024. We expect the momentum we've been experiencing in our Capital Markets segment over the past few years to continue with healthy growth in excess of 6%."", 'The segment will continue to benefit from market share gains and expansion into newer verticals. During the third quarter of 2023, fueled by the success of our Future Forward strategy, we returned the company to year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the first time in nearly two years. Building on the success of Future Forward and the underlying fundamentals of the business, we are confident that the company is positioned for sustainable margin expansion in 2024 and beyond. The revenue acceleration and operational improvements just discussed, coupled with balanced capital deployment, will allow us to deliver 5% to 7% normalized EPS growth, which include a high single-digit negative dis-synergy impact. As a result of this improved financial outlook, we are committed to returning over $4 billion of capital to our shareholders across buybacks and dividends in 2024.', ""Looking forward, current favorable market trends as well as the operational efficiencies we continue to drive leave us confident that we are positioned for further earnings acceleration beyond 2024. Turning to Slide 8. We are seeing increased client demand and a growing sales pipeline as our products and services continue to resonate, especially with large financial institutions. Based on the current level of activity we're seeing across our pipeline, we expect an acceleration in new sales in 2024 as compared to 2023, aiding revenue growth beyond 2024. During the fourth quarter, we signed multiple marquee wins across our businesses. Beginning with enterprise core platforms, we're seeing increased demand from the regional community bank market for our bundled offerings of core digital payments through strong new sales and implementations."", ""Additionally, we signed several new and expanded core engagements with regional community and international financial institutions, including a key competitive takeaway Banc of California with approximately $40 billion in assets. Also, demand for FIS' digital banking solutions remains strong. Our Digital One platform was selected by some of the most demanding banks and financial institutions, including a global asset manager with greater than $1 trillion in assets under management. Likewise, we've seen continued robust sales for our Digital One Studio with leading national, regional and super-regional banks, including Hancock Whitney, First Citizens Bank and Bank of Montreal. These banks have all deployed solutions from our digital suite, which offers deeper personalization capabilities in support of their deposit growth, product cross-sell and customer experience improvement objective."", 'To underscore our progress in digital banking, our sales pipeline continues to expand with demand from large financial institutions increasing in the double digits. Our payments and network businesses continue to gain traction and we are expanding our sales focus in these areas, given the long growth runway they represent. The NYCE debit network had another strong quarter of new sales. We signed multiple new engagements with premier financial institutions, retailers and global media companies. Additionally, FedNow continues to gain traction. We now have over 215 clients either in contract or in our pipeline and we are now certified to both send and receive payments. Moving on to Capital Markets. Beginning with securities trading and processing, our market-leading Cleared Derivatives solution was selected by a global financial technology provider and a leading alternative asset manager.', ""Additionally, our Treasury Solutions had another strong quarter of new sales. We signed new engagements with a leading financial technology company, several municipal governments, a multinational healthcare provider and an online consumer apparel provider. Our Lending Solutions also had a number of impressive new or expanded wins in the quarter. This included a leading U.S. automaker, several European automakers as well as several global financial institutions who are seeking a partner who could service and support their global client base. I'm encouraged by the trends we experienced over the second half of 2023 and confident we are poised for a meaningful sales acceleration in 2024. 2023 was a year of significant positive momentum at FIS. I'm incredibly proud of the team for their commitment to our Future Forward strategy and the heightened focus on improving client centricity, accelerating product innovation and simplifying our go-to-market approach."", ""Our performance in 2023 and our strengthened position entering 2024 give me confidence that we're on the right path to further improve operational and financial outcomes going-forward. With that in mind, FIS plans to host an Investor Day in New York City on Tuesday, May 7. We hope you can join us for a discussion on our go-forward corporate strategy post the Worldpay separation, our playbook for sustainable success in our Banking and Capital Markets segments, and of course, our multi-year financial targets and capital allocation framework. With that, let me turn it over to James for a discussion of our fourth quarter financial results and 2024 outlook. James?"", ""James Kehoe: Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning. I'll begin on Slide 11 with some comments on our 2023 performance and the key drivers of earnings power for the upcoming year. As Stephanie noted, we are pleased with our results having consistently exceeded the high end of the outlook. The original EBITDA guidance was $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion and the actual results came in well above the high end of the range. The outperformance was driven by strong recurring revenue growth from both Banking and Capital Markets, profitability improvements, fueled by our Future Forward program, and better-than-expected performance from Worldpay, which is now reflected in discontinued operations. On January 31, we completed the majority sale of the Worldpay business."", 'The transaction positions both companies for future success, allowing them to focus on their respective end markets and to pursue appropriate capital allocation strategies. The transaction has also allowed FIS to transform its capital structure, paying down debt to ensure an investment-grade rating while accelerating return of capital to shareholders and allowing for appropriate levels of investment in the business. FIS is now well-positioned to deliver accelerating revenue growth with a return to sustainable margin expansion. Revenue growth will accelerate from 3% in 2023 to 4% to 4.5% in 2024, or 3.8% to 4.3% excluding acquisitions and dis-synergies. Adjusted EBITDA margin is projected to expand by 20 basis points to 40 basis points. Adjusted EPS is projected to grow 38% to 41% year-over-year on a continuing operations basis, including a significant contribution from the deployment of Worldpay proceeds and the first-time inclusion of the Worldpay Equity Method Investment contribution.', ""On a normalized basis, we expect adjusted EPS to grow 5% to 7%, including a high single-digit negative impact from dis-synergies. Strong core business performance and our Future Forward program have more than offset the negative impact from dis-synergies. Turning now to Slide 12 for a few considerations on our financial reporting going forward. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, FIS' 45% financial interest in Worldpay will now be reported separately on the Equity Method Investment line of the income statement. Our 2024 adjusted EPS outlook of $4.66 to $4.76 includes a $0.69 to $0.71 contribution from Worldpay. Please note that the $0.69 to $0.71 is for 11 months only. Had the transaction closed at the end of last year, our 2024 adjusted EPS for continuing operations would have been $0.06 higher resulting in a pro forma adjusted EPS of $4.72 to $4.82 on a full-year basis."", ""Consistent with our prior messaging, our go-forward adjusted EPS outlook will include the Worldpay EMI contribution. And we will also be providing condensed quarterly financial results for Worldpay on a 100% basis, including revenue and EBITDA on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. Lastly, going forward, FIS will be presenting revenue growth on an adjusted basis. This reflects year-over-year constant-currency revenue growth for our Banking Solutions and Capital Markets operating segments. With that, let's turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 13. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and this is the fourth consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding the high end of our outlook. Including Worldpay, total company revenue increased 1% to $3.7 billion with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.2% and adjusted EPS of $1.67."", 'Total company adjusted EBITDA margin was flat year-over-year, held back by a margin decline in discontinued operations. On a continuing operations basis, revenue was flat at $2.5 billion and this was in line with our expectations. Strong recurring revenue growth across both Banking and Capital Markets was offset by expected declines in non-recurring revenue and professional services. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by a strong 70 basis points year-over-year, led by meaningful margin expansion in Banking Solutions. Adjusted EPS for continuing operations was $0.94 in the quarter, a decline of 4% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher interest expense with a negative impact of $0.07. For discontinued operations, revenue increased 2% to $1.2 billion, modestly ahead of our expectations.', ""Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 160 basis points reflecting a less favorable revenue mix and the timing of certain expenses. Moving now to cash flow and balance sheet metrics, where we continue to drive improvements. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting in a normalized free cash flow conversion of 100%, with a full year conversion rate of 95%. This compares very favorably to our 2023 full year target of greater than 80% free cash flow conversion. We ended the year with total debt of $19.1 billion with a leverage ratio of 3 times. As previously communicated, we repurchased $510 million of shares during the fourth quarter of '23 resulting in over $800 million of capital returned to shareholders in the quarter and $1.7 billion for the year as a whole."", 'Turning now to our segment results on Slide 14. For the quarter, adjusted revenue growth was flat year-over-year, in line with our expectations. As expected, backlog remained stable at $23.5 billion. Continued strong recurring revenue growth of 7% was offset by anticipated non-recurring headwinds. Banking revenue was flat in the quarter, while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 270 basis points, primarily driven by Future Forward cost initiatives. Banking recurring revenue grew a healthy 7%, including stronger-than-expected consumer spend in our payments business and the benefit from a prior year grow-over. Note that our calculation of Banking recurring revenue growth reflects two changes. First, in keeping with historical practice, we have transitioned certain non-strategic businesses, which we expect to settle or wind-down from Banking Solutions to the Corporate and Other segment.', 'Second, with the expiration of federal funds related to pandemic relief programs, we have moved this revenue from recurring revenue to non-recurring revenue with no change to total revenue. We have provided a detailed reconciliation table for these adjustments in the appendix. As you will see, these adjustments have a de minimis impact on full year recurring revenue growth. Banking recurring revenue growth of 4% in 2023 is unchanged, while the changes increase our 2022 recurring revenue growth by a mere 40 basis points. The recurring revenue growth of 7% was offset by expected declines in other non-recurring revenue and professional services of 22% and 31%, respectively. The decline in other non-recurring revenue includes an 11% headwind from the decline in pandemic relief revenues while the decline in professional services reflects a difficult comparison.', 'Turning now to Capital Markets. Capital Markets adjusted revenue increased 1%, led by continued strong recurring revenue growth of 7%. As expected, non-recurring revenue declined by 10%, primarily driven by a difficult year-over-year comparison related to license fees, which we have consistently messaged throughout the year. The decline in higher-margin non-recurring license revenue was the primary driver of the 250 basis point margin contraction. Looking forward, we will be facing lower headwinds from both professional services and other non-recurring revenue. And we expect to see closer alignment between adjusted revenue growth and recurring revenue growth. Turning now to our full year results by segment on Slide 15. Adjusted revenue growth increased 3%, led by strong recurring revenue growth of 5%.', 'Banking revenue was up 2% as recurring revenue growth of 4% offset declines in non-recurring revenue and lower professional services. Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat, but margins were strong in the second half of the year as Future Forward savings accelerated. Capital Markets revenue increased 5%, led by very strong recurring revenue growth of 9%. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 60 basis points to 50.3%, primarily due to lower margins over the second half of the year, reflecting a lower contribution from higher-margin license fees. Turning now to Slide 16 for an update on Future Forward. I am pleased to report that we have exceeded our 2023 target for Future Forward OpEx savings and we see further upside in 2024. We delivered in-period EBITDA savings of $155 million, well above our original goal of $100 million.', 'And we are raising our 2024 incremental savings target from $215 million to $280 million. We are reiterating our total cash savings target of $1 billion for the Future Forward program. We are reaffirming our capital reduction target, increasing our OpEx savings goal, and adopting a slightly more conservative view regarding the reduction in acquisition, integration and other expenses. Turning now to our capital allocation priorities on Slide 17. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged from the prior quarter. We intend to use our strong financial position and balance sheet flexibility to prioritize a balanced set of capital allocation priorities. These priorities include maintaining an investment-grade rating while investing to accelerate growth and consistently returning ample capital to shareholders.', 'For 2024, we are assuming a year-end leverage ratio of approximately 2.8 times, which allows us ample flexibility to invest in the business, while increasing our share repurchase target for the year. We remain committed to paying an above-market dividend. And going forward, we will grow the dividend in line with adjusted net earnings. Reflecting our confidence in the business and our strong free cash flow generation, we are once again raising our share repurchase commitment. We now expect to repurchase at least $3.5 billion of stock in 2024, up from our prior target of at least $3 billion. And through the first two months of this year, we have already repurchased approximately $490 million of the $3.5 billion target. Lastly, we will selectively invest in complementary tuck-in M&A where we can leverage our scale and distribution to drive faster growth across strategic verticals.', ""This balanced capital allocation framework provides a robust value proposition for long-term shareholder value creation. In total, we expect to return greater than $4 billion to shareholders in 2024, up from $1.7 billion in 2023. Now, let's move on to our 2024 outlook on Slide 18. Building on the operational and financial improvements of 2023, our '24 outlook confidently forecast accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins. We are projecting reported revenue of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion, and this includes an adverse currency impact of around $20 million. Adjusted revenue growth will accelerate from 3% in '23 to 4% to 4.5% in 2024. Our projections include 70 basis points from closed tuck-in acquisitions. But this is mostly offset by a negative impact of 50 basis points from dis-synergies."", 'Net of these impacts, adjusted revenue growth would be approximately 3.8% to 4.3%. We expect the Banking segment to grow between 3% to 3.5% or 3.3% to 3.8% net of acquisitions and dis-synergies, up from 2% in 2023. And we anticipate Capital Markets revenue growth of 6.5% to 7% or 5.1% to 5.6% net of acquisitions, as compared to 5% in 2023. We are forecasting year-over-year margin expansion of 20 basis points to 40 basis points, reflecting continued favorable impact from the Future Forward program and the inherent leverage in our business model. Included in this outlook is a $280 million year-over-year benefit from the Future Forward program. And this will more than offset dis-synergies from the Worldpay transaction of $250 million. We have provided our assumptions regarding the key below-the-line items with some additional details in the appendix.', 'We are projecting D&A of $1.075 billion and we anticipate a tax rate of 17.2% to 17.5%. Interest expense is projected at around $350 million. And we expect shares outstanding of 556 million shares, a reduction of 6% compared to 2023. Including an 11-month EMI contribution of $0.69 to $0.71, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of between $4.66 and $4.76. This translates to a growth rate of 38% to 41% on a continuing operations basis. On a normalized basis, we expect adjusted EPS to grow 5% to 7%, including a high single-digit negative impact from dis-synergies. Lastly, on a pro-forma basis, including 12 months of Worldpay EMI contribution, we anticipate adjusted EPS of $4.72 to $4.82. We are confident in our balanced outlook for 2024 and believe we are well-positioned to accelerate long-term earnings growth.', ""Let's move now to Slide 19, where we provide a reconciliation for our 2023 results on a normalized basis. Last quarter, we provided an estimated normalized adjusted EPS range of $4.40 to $4.55. I am happy to report that both continuing ops EPS and normalized EPS came in within the guidance ranges we provided. Continuing operations EPS was $3.37, and was at the higher end of the range that we provided on the third quarter call. On a 12-month basis, normalized EPS was $4.50, and again this was toward the higher end of the range. Adjusted for an 11-month EMI contribution, 2023 normalized EPS is $4.44. Moving now to Slide 20 for an overview of our first quarter outlook. We are projecting revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5% with Banking Solutions at 1% to 2% and Capital Markets at 6% to 7%."", 'We expect Banking revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year, reflecting easier year-over-year revenue comparisons and the favorable impact from stronger new sales over the second half of 2023. We are anticipating adjusted EBITDA of $955 million to $970 million, which translates to year-over-year margin expansion of 180 basis points to 200 basis points, reflecting Future Forward savings. Including an expected two-month EMI contribution of $0.09 to $0.10, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.94 to $0.97. Continuing operations EPS is projected to increase 31% to 35% and we estimate high single-digit growth on a normalized basis. In summary, we are expecting a good start to the year, with revenue growth accelerating compared to the fourth quarter and improved alignment between adjusted revenue and recurring revenue growth.', 'Margins will expand, and this is consistent with the performance delivered in the second half of last year. Let me now wrap up on Slide 21. In closing, we are encouraged by our 2023 results and believe we are on the right path as we reposition the enterprise for long-term success. The completion of the Worldpay transaction positions both companies for future success and meaningfully improves our capital structure. We are confident FIS will deliver accelerated business growth in 2024 with adjusted revenue growth of at least 4%, and a return to consistent margin expansion. And given our confidence in how the business is performing, our improved financial flexibility and the attractive valuation of our stock, we have once again raised our total share repurchase target to at least $3.5 billion in 2024 and greater than $4 billion in total.', 'With that, operator, could you please open the line for questions?', 'See also 20 Richest People in Africa in 2024 and Top 10 Uranium Producing Companies In The World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

While dividend payments have never been the first priority of the Oracle of Omaha while looking for new investments, he does give them a lot of importance and almost always mentions his portfolio companies with growing dividends in his annual letters. In his latest annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett talked about Coca-Cola\xa0Co (NYSE:KO) and American Express\xa0Company (NYSE:AXP), in which Berkshire owns $24 billion and $28 billion worth of stakes, respectively.', '""During 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke – extending our own Rip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of AMEX earnings in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase. Both AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 – about 16% in the case of AMEX – and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the year. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell you: “No way.”', 'Though Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect ownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made at Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every asset that Berkshire owns. To this obvious but often overlooked truth, I add my usual caveat: All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done at a premium.', 'The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', 'Buffett loves it when he does not have to touch his stakes and let the investments do all the work. He believes his investments are rewarded when the companies he has invested in increase dividends and focus on shareholder returns.', 'Methodology', ""But Coca Cola and American Express aren’t the only two dividend-paying stocks in Buffett's portfolio. In this article we scanned Berkshire's Q4 portfolio and picked 15 stocks that pay dividends.

In January T-Mobile Us Inc (NAQSDAQ:TMUS) posted fourth quarter results, according which T-Mobile Us Inc's (NAQSDAQ:TMUS) GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $1.67, missing estimates by $0.23.

T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile’s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost. T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.', 'This combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition. In the three years since completing its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has grown its post-paid subscriber base by about 22%. Over the same period, AT&T’s has grown by about 14%, while Verizon’s by less than 5%.', 'Given the high fixed-cost nature of the wireless business, these steady increases in revenue growth have led to outsize increases in profits and free cash flow. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to come in around $13.5 billion, up from less than $8 billion last year. In 2024 free cash flow is expected to grow by over 20% to approximately $17 billion — providing a 10% yield based on today’s stock price.', 'We have long admired T-Mobile, but until recently the stock did not pay a dividend.

The company boasts a diversified deposits base with about 80% FDIC insured, well above industry average. It is the only major bank 100% in the cloud, which enables better underwriting and quicker response to changes in the environment. This technology also helps reduce operating and fraud cost while freeing up cash flow for reinvestment in marketing to grow products (Venture X card) and build its brand. Periods of stress, like we saw in the banking sector during March, are a reminder of the underwriting acumen and high quality deposits of Capital One. We added to our position after the fallout, knowing that the company’s seasoned management team had steered capably through previous cycles. Today, as credit card delinquencies have risen to more normal levels, Capital One is already reporting a slowing in delinquency growth.

Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth, increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% yearon-year, progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances.

Whether because of their unconventional or perhaps controversial businesses, certain companies just don’t get the immediate nod.', 'That might be a mistake. Yes, the usual suspects – such as the most-popular dividend aristocrats and kings – capture most of the attention. However, as with anything, a little digging around can yield surprisingly robust ideas.', 'Further, by going beyond the conventional route, you may be able to extract far better total returns than jumping on the same boring familiar trades. On that note, below are enticing ideas for overlooked dividend stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'A data storage company, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of hard disk drives (HDDs). As well, the company designs and manufactures solid-state drives (SSDs). Beyond these core products, Seagate invests in research and development to innovate and come up with new data storage technologies. Such advancements offer significant implications for cloud computing and data center applications.', 'Because of its role in facilitating storage of vast amounts of data, Seagate benefits from the tremendous interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Indeed, over the past one-year period, STX rewarded stakeholders with solid double-digit returns. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into society, it’s quite possible – if not outright plausible – that STX could swing higher.', 'However, such tech-focused enterprises don’t seem an ideal place for passive income. But that’s exactly why STX is one of the overlooked dividend stocks. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 3.23%, well above the tech sector average of 1.37%. Also, the payout ratio is reasonable at 59.14%, thus providing confidence toward yield sustainability.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'I talk about legacy tech juggernaut IBM (NYSE:IBM) a lot. It’s not a scientific survey or anything. However, since Aug. 8 of last year, I mentioned Big Blue in 23 stories. I believe my colleague Larry Ramer comes in second at nine mentions. During this time, I’m sure all my colleagues who mentioned the company will agree: it’s been a great run.', 'Previously, IBM has been the red-haired stepchild of the tech ecosystem. While it has a pedigree like no other, it’s nowhere near as exciting as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Further, because of the glare of the competition, IBM in some ways represents one of the overlooked dividend stocks. Moving forward, that should no longer be the case.', 'Thanks to its myriad innovations, including for AI, ML and even the blockchain, Big Blue has reasserted its relevance. At the same time, the company sports a forward yield of 3.62%. Even better, it offers 28 years of consecutive payout increases, making it one of the dividend aristocrats.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'In the emerging world of digitalized everything, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) may strike many young investors as one of the overlooked dividend stocks. The history of the company stems from its first security vaults, which stored important documents and valuable assets. To this day, Iron Mountain stays true to its roots, providing solutions for physical storage of important records and equipment.', 'That’s not to say that this is the company’s only business. Over the years, Iron Mountain has evolved into a digital transformation specialist. However, it still provides “old school” services such as offsite records storage. Fundamentally, with cybercrime reaching astronomical heights, it always pays to be safe than sorry. And while some of the top hackers can crack basically anything, the digital realm symbolizes an impossibility.', 'Currently, IRM carries a forward yield of 3.8%. Financially, the enterprise’s standout metrics include its consistent profitability and strong revenue and EBITDA growth. Analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with a $74.60 price target.', 'Source: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the indirect players in the burgeoning e-commerce field, Stag Industrial (NYSE:STAG) deserves consideration for your portfolio. Structured as a real estate investment trust or REIT, the company prioritizes storage facilities and warehouses. As InvestorPlace contributor Marc Guberti noted, Stag owns 568 buildings in 41 states. Additionally, the company has many big-name tenants that will stick around for years.', 'If you’re looking for stable cash flow, STAG stock belongs on your radar. Just as importantly, the REIT’s warehouse and distribution facilities support the storage, fulfillment and distribution of goods purchased online. With e-commerce transactions as a percentage of total retail sales rising higher since the second quarter of 2022, STAG should benefit from a resilient demand profile.', 'Lastly, it’s tough to ignore the passive income, with the company’s forward yield landing at 3.82%. Also, it’s on a small but growing payout increase streak of six years. Therefore, it’s a solid candidate for overlooked dividend stocks to buy.', 'Source: bht2000 / Shutterstock.com', 'While I wouldn’t necessarily label Pembina Pipeline (NYSE:PBA) an outright oddity, it arguably qualifies for overlooked dividend stocks. Basically, when people look for passive income in the hydrocarbon space, they target big oil companies. We’re talking about Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and their ilk. However, more adventurous investors may want to give PBA stock a chance.', 'First, on the yield side, Pembina wins hands down. Exxon offers a forward yield of 3.7% while Chevron lands at 4.23%. In contrast, PBA stakeholders enjoy a forward yield of 5.84%. Granted, the payout ratio is high at 84% and it lacks a consecutive track record in payout increases. Still, if you’re looking for income while you sleep, Pembina should have you covered.', 'Second, as the name suggests, the company operates in the midstream component of the value chain; that is, transportation and storage infrastructure. This is a business that’s unlikely to go out of business simply because of vast relevancies.', 'As a bonus, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $38.69 price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A distinct REIT, EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) specializes in amusement parks, movie theaters, ski resorts, and other entertainment properties. Per its public profile, the company owned 353 properties as of 2022. However, EPR may rank as one of the overlooked dividend stocks due to high pressures impacting the consumer economy. After years of inflation and elevated interest rates, many folks couldn’t keep opening their wallets.', 'I have to be careful about my next words because the issue raises much debate. However, a December article by The Seattle Times noted that revenge travel will continue to be a major trend in 2024. Despite many onerous headwinds, Americans are still getting out to explore the world and relax. Cynically, those with more modest means may elect entertainment venues for their rest and relaxation.', 'If you decide to speculate on EPR, the company offers a very enticing forward yield of 7.76%. That’s well above the REIT sector’s average yield of 4.46%. Thus, it’s one of the overlooked stocks to put on your radar.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'As a tobacco giant, British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) ranks among the overlooked dividend stocks for obvious reasons. Fundamentally, it appears that the company is losing relevance. Study after study reveals that global smoking prevalence rates have declined. Further, anti-tobacco advocacy groups have succeeded in taking the “cool” image out of cigarettes.', 'So, is BTI a dead investment? Not quite. For one thing, smoking prevalence isn’t down across the board, with some countries seeing an increase in the underlying practice. Second and more significantly, vaporizers or e-cigarettes have blossomed. By that, I’m referring to legal sales and not the crisis associated with underage vaping, which I absolutely do not support.', 'Fundamentally, tobacco firms may have a better read on what smokers prefer. Thus, they’re are able to better craft “digital” alternatives. Finally, British American’s forward yield stands at 9.81%. Moreover, its payout ratio comes in at a reasonable 61.56%. With such a robust dividend, even those uninterested in the industry may consider BTI stock.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Moreover, a decent dividend from a stock will pay for the trading costs and return more than you might get from a bank while you wait for long-term capital appreciation.', ""In this context, buying into stocks that benefit when the Federal Reserve ultimately starts cutting interest rates is a good idea, and I think Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR), Owens Corning (NYSE: OC), and Unted Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS)\xa0are three such companies. Here's why."", 'Lower interest rates will do wonders for the U.S. housing market, which means there is good news for the demand for household appliances.', ""That's especially relevant to Whirlpool because it is set to increase its focus on its core North American market this year. It will do so by combining its low-margin European business with a subsidiary of a Turkish company to create a new company, which Whirlpool will own 25% of."", ""The deal will free up management's time and resources to grow margins at its North American segment while implementing $300 million to $400 million of cost cuts in 2024, down from $800 million in 2023."", ""As such, Whirlpool will likely end 2024 as a more focused company, with lower structural costs and an improving household appliances market.

Meanwhile, management is undergoing a strategic review of its glass reinforcements business. Ultimately, exiting the latter will increase its housing focus as the glass reinforcements business sells into wind energy and other industrial end markets."", ""The deal makes sense from a cost synergy perspective (sharing supply-chain costs and sales, general, and administrative costs is intended to cut expenses by $125 million within two years). And there's an opportunity for revenue synergies. Owens Corning and Masonite sell to builders, contractors, distributors, and home centers, with the possibilities to develop sales to each other's customers."", 'The deal is also a display of long-term confidence in the U.S. housing market (Masonite generates 90% of its sales in North America). It could be an extremely opportune purchase if the market turns later in the year.', ""Lower interest rates won't just help sectors like housing and automotive that are directly exposed; it will also support economic activity in general. That's a significant plus for package delivery companies like UPS. When growth is good, delivery volumes increase, and customers are happier paying for premium delivery options. The reverse is true when growth slows."", ""UPS suffered the impact of a slowing economy last year, and protracted labor negotiations also hit it. The negotiations weren't friction-free, and many customers diverted volumes from UPS for fear of a strike."", 'And added costs associated with the new contracts pressured profit margins. The result was a 29% decline in adjusted profit in 2023,\xa0 and the company starting 2024 in weak shape.', 'That said, many of the headwinds could turn into tailwinds in 2024. For example, UPS is already winning back customers and has an opportunity to do so throughout the year.', 'And the impact of extra costs will be lapped in 2024, leading to better profit margins later in the year. An improved growth environment, possibly from lower interest rates, will benefit UPS.', 'Lastly, management continues to grow revenue in its key targeted end markets, such as small and medium-size businesses and healthcare.

The restructuring of the 30-stock index resulted in the exit of medical-retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance and the entry of the e-commerce super giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.', 'The restructuring was initiated after the retail giant Walmart Inc. (WMT) decided on a 3-to-1 stock split. Unlike the other two major stock indexes — the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — the Dow is a price-weighted index and not a market-capital-weighted index.', 'The Dow, which started its journey in May 1896, is always inclined toward old-economy cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and oil-energy. However, its peers have more representation from growth sectors like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary.', 'As a result, the blue-chip index under performs its peers. In 2023, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 43.4%. The broad-market S&P 500 Index also saw an impressive rally of 23.9%. However, the Dow was up just 13.7%. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up 3.3%, 7.1%, and 8.6%, respectively.', 'Inclusion of Amazon is seen as a strategic move to increase the blue-chip index’s exposure to new-economy stocks. Broadly, Amazon is categorized as a consumer discretionary company. However, its massive adoption of high-end technologies compelled a large-section of financial analysts to categorize it as a technology bigwig.', 'Amazon’s entry will significantly increase the exposure of the blue-chip index in the e-commerce, consumer retail and technology space. Amazon’s weight in the Dow will rank 17th out of the 30 stocks. Walmart’s weight will drop to 26 from 17. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) will remain the most heavily weighted stock on the Dow.', 'On Feb 23, the Dow recorded its all-time highs of 39,282.28 on an intraday basis and 39,131.53 on a closing basis. Technically, at its current level of 38,972.41, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 38,027.55 and 35,253.78, respectively.', 'The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.', 'Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.', 'We have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for 2024.

The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to the performance of AWS. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers also favored the company. Moreover, AMZN’s robust advertising business contributed well.', 'Notably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continues to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positives.

AXP has benefited from growth initiatives, like launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances. Consumer spending on T&E, which carries higher margins for AXP, is advancing well. AXP’s balance sheet looks strong with ample cash. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.', 'Zacks Rank #2 American Express has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.4% and 14.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.6% over the last 30 days.', 'International Business Machines Corp.

While dividend payments have never been the first priority of the Oracle of Omaha while looking for new investments, he does give them a lot of importance and almost always mentions his portfolio companies with growing dividends in his annual letters. In his latest annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett talked about Coca-Cola\xa0Co (NYSE:KO) and American Express\xa0Company (NYSE:AXP), in which Berkshire owns $24 billion and $28 billion worth of stakes, respectively.', '""During 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke – extending our own Rip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of AMEX earnings in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase. Both AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 – about 16% in the case of AMEX – and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the year. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell you: “No way.”', 'Though Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect ownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made at Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every asset that Berkshire owns. To this obvious but often overlooked truth, I add my usual caveat: All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done at a premium.', 'The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', 'Buffett loves it when he does not have to touch his stakes and let the investments do all the work. He believes his investments are rewarded when the companies he has invested in increase dividends and focus on shareholder returns.', 'Methodology', ""But Coca Cola and American Express aren’t the only two dividend-paying stocks in Buffett's portfolio. In this article we scanned Berkshire's Q4 portfolio and picked 15 stocks that pay dividends.

T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile’s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost. T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.', 'This combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition.

I am joined today by four other members of the other tests, executive team, our Chief Medical Officer, Baisong Mei; our Chief Financial Officer, Erick Lucera; our science, Chief Scientific Officer, Linda C. Burkly; and our Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer, Caren Deardorf. We are pleased with Editas has momentum and progress in the fourth quarter and all of 2023 in early 2023, we shared our vision on the three pillars of our strategy to position Editas as a leader in in vivo program for gene editing and hemoglobinopathy. The first of these pillars to Dr. Rennie sell, formerly known as editorial one toward BLA and commercialization. Second, to strengthen, reorganized and focused our discovery organization to build an in vivo editing pipeline from the third to increase business development activities with a particular focus on monetizing our very strong IP. So how did we do last year? While we achieved a loss? First, we accelerate the clinical development of many cell, exceeding our enrollment goal of 20 patients and sharing clinical updates from our Ruby and edited studies in June and in December of 2023 and those accumulating data have strengthened our belief that Renaissance is a competitive potential medicine with a differentiated profile characterized by correction of anemia to normal physiologic ranges of hemoglobin. Second, we strengthened our in vivo discovery capabilities and organization, and hired a new Chief Scientific Officer, Linda Barkley, who brings three decades of experience in successfully inventing, developing and moving new human medicines forward And third, we increased our business development activities and monetize our IP, leveraging our robust IP portfolio. A quick example was our granting Virtex-E non exclusive license for our cash nine IP in a focused way to enable the XL launch. Finally, we strengthened our senior leadership team with people who have a proven track record in bringing new medicines through development to approval and commercialization. So how we executed against the strategy and these objectives will let's start with myself. First on enrollment, we have now enrolled 40 sickle cell and nine beta-thalassemia patients in our Ruby and edit out studies, respectively, and enrollment continues at a good pace. Second, on dosing, we have dosed 18 will be patients in 7,000 patients, and we have multiple patients scheduled for dosing in the coming months. Patient screening and demand in both studies continue to remain robust. Third, on clinical data, we remain on track to present his extensive clinical data dataset of sickle cell patients with considerable clinical follow-up in the Ruby study in the middle of 2024, with a further update by year end 2024. On the regulatory front, we have engaged with the FDA regarding the Ruby sickle cell trial. The FDA agrees that Ruby is a single Phase one two three study and have aligned with us on the study side, our discussions with the FDA will continue as will be at about progress and will be enhanced by our RMS designation for severe sickle cell disease based on, we'll share further details regarding the development of Randy said in his remarks as well as recap the Ruby and any final takeaways and clinical data that we provided in December and share more information on the adolescent cohort. Now let's turn to in-vivo and our pipeline development, where we strengthened our in vivo discovery capabilities at 2023 and began the discovery work on in vivo therapeutic targets in hematopoietic stem cells and other tissues. As we announced earlier this year, we aim to establish in-vivo preclinical proof-of-concept for an undisclosed indication this year. Linda and her team are leveraging key capabilities that we have in-house and shoot forward to sharing more at a future date. Regarding our hemoglobinopathy focus, after a thorough evaluation of the development landscape, we have decided not to pursue internal development of a milder conditioning regime. We believe stand-alone monitor conditioning regiments would be widely available once FDA approved and therefore, we have determined our research, clinical development and regulatory investments in terms of open up, these can be better deployed for our continued development of in vivo HSC methods. Turning to assist about in the fourth quarter, we announced a license agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals added test provided protects a nonexclusive license for Editas Medicine's cast mine gene-editing technology for ex vivo gene editing medicines targeting BCMA gene in the fields of sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, including Vertex's cost savings and the upfront and contingent payments pursuant to this agreement, extended our cash runway into 2026. This and other agreements, the strength of our patents and the number of companies developing crisper Cas nine medicine reaffirm our confidence that our IP portfolio of foundational US and international patents covering cash, nine used in human medicine are a source of meaningful value. So one of our objectives for 2024, Randy, so we will provide a clinical update from the Ruby trial for severe sickle cell disease and the Edipower trial for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia in mid 2024 and by year end 2024. We will complete the adult cohort enrollment and initiate the adolescent cohort in Ruby, which we've already initiated and continue enrollment and ourselves for our in vivo pipeline, we will establish in vivo preclinical proof of concept for an undisclosed indication. And for BD, we will leverage our robust IP portfolio and business development to drive value and complement core gene-editing technology capabilities. We are energized by our progress and execution in 2023. With our sharpened strategic focus, our world-class scientists and employees and our keen drive and execution, we continue to build momentum to progress our strategy to deliver differentiated medicines to patients with serious genetic diseases. Now I will turn the call over to Baisong, our Chief Medical Officer."", 'Baisong Mei', ""Thank you, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Let's talk about the Renaissance, which is on the clinical development of severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. As of today, it will be trial for sickle cell disease. We have enrolled 40 patients and dosed 18 patients. We have multiple patients scheduled for dosing in the coming months. We're also pleased to announce that we have initiated adolescent cohort in the Ruby study which is well above our 2024 objectives. The interest and demand a high and adolescent patient have already started screening in the AD field trial for transfusion dependent. And Beth, you've seen year to date, we have enrolled nine patients and dosed seven patients. As I shared earlier, I continue to visit our Ruby and Eddy failed clinical trial sites and continuously speak with the investigators, I appreciate the enthusiasm and support from the investigators and study sites. I'm pleased with the momentum of Renevia in patient recruitment, freezes, editing and dosing in both studies I'm excited to hear from the investigators that patient does with Renaissance. I've already seen positive changes in our lives. As Gil mentioned, we have aligned with FDA. There will be clinical trial is now considered a Phase one two three trial for FI. We've also aligned with the FDA on the study design and endpoints, and the FDA had agreed to our activation of adolescent cohort. We look forward to future discussion with FDA and continued calibration. Turning to clinical data. In December 2023, we shared safety and efficacy data from 17 patient, 11 Ruby patients, 6 [Editas] patients. Once again, the data confirmed observation from our prior clinical readouts, including benefit of driving early and robust correction of anemia to a normal physiological range of total hemoglobin in sickle cell patients. When I say job robust and sustained increase in fetal hemoglobin in excess of 40%. All will be sickle cell patients have remained free of vessel crews, events falling rent if they are treated rent-to-sales, treat sickle cell and benefit, assuming a patient have shown successful engraftment have stopped red blood cell transfusion and the safety profile of benefit observed to date is consistent with yourself and Bob electric conditioning and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. In addition, the trajectory of the correction of anemia and expression of fetal hemoglobin is consistent across Renaissance treated sickle cell disease patient and beta-thalassemia patients at the same follow-up time points. These data reinforce our belief that we have a competitive product and the product potentially differentiated from other treatments with rapid correction of meaning. Thanks to the deliberate choice and our discovery group has made early in the progress as we have previously stated the choice of crisper enzyme and the parliament to edit for increase the hemoglobin fetal hemoglobin expression matters, beneficial use of our proprietary Asia to our enzyme to added HBG when to promote at the ASCA. 12 A. increases efficiency of editing and a significantly reduced off target at eight when compared to other crisper nucleus, including test. Now anything HBG. one to promote or a human CD34 positive cells without a greater red blood cell protection, normal curvature for capacity and improved red blood cell health. We'll come back to editing of BCL11A. We look for differentiation in three categories of outcome in clinical trials, hematological parameter and organ function and patient reported outcome of quality of life. Based on the clinical data thus far, we believe that sustained normal level of total hemoglobin could be a potential point of differentiation for Renovis. As a reminder, a sustained normal to hemoglobin level is an important clinical outcome for patients and the correction of anemia can significantly improve quality of life and ameliorate and organ damage. We look forward to sharing additional updates, including Ruby and Edison clinical trial data with more patients and longer follow-up period in midyear and additional data by year end. Now I turn the call over to Erick, our Chief Financial Officer."", 'Erick Lucera', ""Thank you based on and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be speaking with you, and I'd like to refer you to our press release issued earlier today for a summary of financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. And I'll take this opportunity to briefly review a few items for the fourth quarter. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31 were $427 million compared to $446 million as of September 30, 2023. We expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the near term annual license fees and contingent upfront payment payable under our license agreement with Vertex to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures into 2026. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $60 million, which primarily relates to revenue recognized under our license agreement with Vertex which, as Gilmore referenced earlier on this call, we announced in December of 2023. R & D expenses this quarter increased by $18 million to $70 million from the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase reflects additional sublicense expenses offset by the decrease in R&D spend resulting from our reprioritization and targeted focus on our red cell program. G&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $14 million, which decreased from $18 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in expense is primarily attributable to reduced patent and legal costs. Overall, Editas remains in a strong financial position, bolstered by our sharpened its discovery focus, June capital raise and our recent out-licensing deals. Our cash runway into 2026 provides ample resources to support our continued progress in the Ruby and Eddie Bauer clinical trials that went to sell, continued commercial manufacturing preparation and the advancement of our discovery and research efforts. With that, I'll hand the call back to Gilmore."", ""Gilmore O'Neill"", ""Thank you, Eric.

Thanks for taking our questions this morning. Can you just kind of give us a sense of your what does the Phase one two three destination for Ruby really mean from a time line perspective and on the potential differentiation, I think based on your talk about investigators feedback so far, I'm curious if you can also talk about just a feedback that you've been hearing from investigators, are they seeing potential differentiation in this early on? Thank you."", 'Erick Lucera', ""Thanks very much, Brian. So I think there were three parts to your question, what is the phase one, two, three and its impact on sort of the DLA pass on loss? Was the investigator feedback on differentiation and where they're seeing signs, Bob or things that they might be seeing in patients at this point. And what I'll do is just address the first part and then ask Basab to follow up on the other two. So with regard to Phase one, two three, I think the key point here is that it is a single we've agreed that there's a single Phase one two three study. And we have important agreements on what the outcomes are and the size of the study. And what that basically means is that we remain on track and are confident more confident about being on track two to a BLA. I think it's worth calling out that at Vertex, a study was also the study that was used for their BLA application was designated a Phase one two three before prior to AT THAT THE LA. So I hope that actually helps from the point of view of our path to BLA and I think just mentioning Bertek, it was just worth calling out that we sort of had a benchmark based on the BLA filing from last year with regard to the size of the filing that was originally used for that approval based on?"", 'Baisong Mei', ""Thanks. Brian, on the for the differentiation and the investigator feedback wise. And so we actually have quite a bit engagement with it with the investigator and from their all their own observation of their patient as well as I see the data, they are very pleased to see the correction of anemia. And as a hematologist that very much I appreciate that the level of total hemoglobin be able to correct the anemia and they see their patients is less fatigue and they have more energy and they just they have direct observation. And then also they have put us that tubing level as published also impacted the end organ function.

There's just a lot of work that needs to happen and I think you all are picking up on that, but it's starting and it's happening. So I think it's the balance of saying there's tremendous interest even from the government in the CMMI. pilot that CMS has kicked off. So that's the way we see it as is very encouraging. It's going to take time and we really believe that the fast follower of Renaissance is going to be timed very well, gives us time to be able to continue to collect data that is meaningful, differentiated to understand where centers may be struggling and where else we can optimize our vein-to-vein process to deliver a product that's differentiated, not just in efficacy and safety, perhaps, but also in our operational aspects.

If you agree on the single study also number of a patient, I'm not sure if they agree on the duration of the study will be trial. So wondering if we think about the crisper trial, Vertex trial, it's about 45 to 50 patients. Is that online? Was that numbers? And what is the duration? The FDA requires And a related question is how many active sites you have now and what is your goal? Total sites for the pivotal?"", ""Gilmore O'Neill"", ""Sorry, and thanks very much, Gina, for your question. Before I let me just address a couple of things from point of view of the study design. I think first of all, the benchmark that was set by the BLA with Vertex's approval by the FDA for extra sale is actually very good benchmark and what we against which we are operating. And that has certainly in far informed our discussions with the FDA and we were actually very pleased with the discussions with the FDA, and we believe that it's actually really puts us on a track that lines up with the benchmark. And as a result, when we actually talk about having enrolled 40 patients who have initiated the adolescent enrollment and so on. We believe we're actually in a very good track on a four to a BLA with regard to the number of active sites, I do want to clarify something that we're not talking about a separate study, essentially the Ruby study, which is ongoing with its sites activated is the Phase one two three study that will be used for BLA, and that is the agreement that we have with the agency."", 'Gena Wang', ""Okay.

So can you talk about sort of the dropouts there. What was the reason behind that? And then another clarification on the FDA side. When you talk about differentiation, have you guys actually engage them on the angle you're taking on the differentiation, whether total hemoglobin or end organ function? How are they perceiving that in terms of the conversation? Thanks so much."", ""Gilmore O'Neill"", ""Thanks very much, Jake. On first of all, I think we're actually very happy with where we are with our dosing 18 patients dosed arm.

And actually with regard to our driving towards BLA at we have no, we have not had dropouts so just to be sure that there's no confusion about that. And I think the final thing is that, you know, based on your myself with our clinical experience and particularly when you're dealing with a complex therapeutic that you're going to get some waves, you know, ups and downs and waves of not just enrollment and dosing, particularly around scheduling around holiday periods. Et cetera. So as baseline also said, we have and many more patients scheduled for dosing in the coming months. And as I say, remain on track for a substantial data set in the middle of the year with regard to differentiation and our conversations with the FDA, as we have actually highlighted our potential differentiation, the mechanistic differences behind that, et cetera.

So we are very happy with the collaborative nature of the engagements."", ""Gilmore O'Neill"", ""If I can I just add to that is that we, as we said before, when we actually watch the AdCom discussion. We were very gratified by what we heard and saw because our confidence at both in the comprehensive nature of our M. off-target editing oversight package was actually very robust at relative to the discussion of the AdCom. And frankly, our off-target editing data package is actually very good and not surprisingly, because we are using our own engineered ASCA. 12 A. enzyme, which is a high fidelity as well as high-efficiency enzyme. And it's worth saying that in our in our hands and the hands of others on off-target editing is not detectable across the genome wide screen on as opposed to cast nine. So we feel very good about that. And then with regard to the in vivo characteristics, I think I just want to say I said before that our key things are factors that we are focusing on is to select a set of targets that are high conviction based on the potential for critical differentiation from the current standard of care.

With regards to the editing tools, well, we have, I think, been very clear that we are focusing on our ASCA. 12 A. editor, and we are really focused on that because for a number of reasons. First, it's our proprietary enzyme that we have selected going forward because of its high fidelity and high efficiency because of the benefits of it using a smaller guide and the advantages for quality, et cetera, in the manufacturing. And then finally on and because we have human proof of concept, we have very exciting, robust editing data in human cells from a US customer today from our red cell program so all of those are the reasons why we're favoring and using that editing tool and that regards to delivery, we are using a nonviral focusing on nonviral delivery and nanoparticles specifically super helpful."", 'Jay Olson', 'Thank you so much.', 'Baisong Mei', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Yanan Zhu, Wells Fargo.', 'Yanan Zhu', 'Oh, great.

Then this station will have continued to monitor for the patient longer part of follow-up period and then we have 18 patient patient both now and then by the middle of the year.

Invest $19,000 Into the Following 3 Time-Tested Dividend Kings.",Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/96ce8636-164b-3cc5-a2ef-f8be6be1b2ca/want-%241%2C000-in-ultra-safe.html,1709201160,STORY,"['JNJ', 'MO', 'KO']","['Wall Street offers investors an assortment of pathways to make money. However, few strategies have been more successful over the long run than buying and holding dividend stocks.', 'Last year, Hartford Funds released a report that thoroughly examined the ins and outs of dividend stocks over extended periods. In particular, a collaboration with Ned Davis Research found that income stocks averaged a 9.18% annual return over a half-century (1973-2022), with dividend growers and initiators really packing a punch (10.24% annualized return). For comparison, the annualized return of the equal-weighted S&P 500 came in at 7.68%, while the average annual return of non-payers was a mere 3.95% over the same timeline.', ""Hartford Funds' findings shouldn't be all that surprising. Businesses that pay continuous dividends tend to be profitable on a recurring basis and, in many instances, they can provide transparent long-term growth outlooks. In short, they're just the type of companies you'd expect to see grow in value over lengthy periods."", ""However, no two dividend stocks are cut from the same cloth. If investors want truly safe annual income, their best bet is to search among Wall Street's Dividend Kings. A Dividend King is a company that's raised its base annual payout for at least 50 consecutive years. Chances are that if a business has increased its aggregate payout for a half-century or longer, it's a time-tested operating model."", 'If you want $1,000 in ultra-safe annual dividend income, simply invest $19,000 (split equally, three ways) into the following three time-tested Dividend Kings, which sport an S&P 500-trouncing average yield of 5.26%.', ""The first Dividend King that can provide exceptionally safe and consistent income from a starting investment of $19,000 that's split across three stocks is none other than healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). J&J, as the company is more commonly known, has raised its base annual payout in each of the past 61 years."", 'Investors might note that J&J has failed to keep pace with the rising stock market over the past 14 months. This is primarily due to uncertainty over litigation concerning its now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder, which is alleged to have caused cancer in some users. Johnson & Johnson has attempted to settle these lawsuits, which number up to 100,000, on two occasions, but ultimately had its settlement proposals tossed in court.', ""While the above might sound like a dealbreaker to some investors, let me assure you that Johnson & Johnson is about as rock-solid of a company as they come. It's one of only two publicly traded companies to have received the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of S&P Global. J&J has nearly $23 billion in cash on its balance sheet and generated over $22 billion in operating cash flow in 2023. It won't have any trouble paying a settlement."", ""Additionally, J&J brings cash-flow predictability to the table. We don't get to decide when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop. Regardless of what's happening with the stock market or U.S./global economy, demand for prescription drugs, medical devices, and healthcare services remains steady."", ""Speaking of steady, one of Johnson & Johnson's greatest strengths has been the continuity of key leaders. You only need two hands to count the number of CEOs the company has had since its founding in 1886. Avoiding a carousel at the top has ensured that J&J's growth initiatives have remained on track."", ""Decisively shifting its focus to novel pharmaceuticals more than a decade ago has also played a key role in J&J's steady adjusted operating earnings growth. Even though brand-name drugs have finite periods of sales exclusivity, they offer superior pricing power and margins. J&J hasn't been shy about investing in novel research and collaborations to keep its pharmaceutical growth engine humming along."", ""A second Dividend King that can be responsible for producing $1,000 in ultra-safe annual dividend income from a beginning investment of $19,000 that's split three ways is tobacco giant Altria Group (NYSE: MO). Altria has raised its payout 58 times over the past 54 years, is currently yielding almost 10%, and intends to keep its payout ratio around 80%."", ""There's no sugarcoating that tobacco companies are contending with a changing landscape. Consumers have become increasingly aware of the potential long-term dangers of tobacco use, which has sent adult cigarette smoking rates in the U.S. plunging from 42% in 1965 to just 11.5%, as of 2021. The good news for the U.S.-focused Altria is that it has a couple of catalysts in its corner that can still move the needle."", ""As I've pointed out a number of times before, Altria's clearest advantage is its pricing power. Tobacco contains nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. The lure to continue using tobacco products allows Altria to raise its prices with minimal customer pushback. Price hikes help it to somewhat or fully offset declines in cigarette shipments."", ""It also doesn't hurt that Altria has the most desirable products within the tobacco space. Specifically, premium brand Marlboro gobbled up a 42.1% share of the U.S. cigarette market in 2023, with Altria's entire portfolio accounting for a nearly 47% share of the domestic cigarette industry. When you're the top dog, it makes raising prices even easier."", 'However, the way Altria is going to put concerns about a shrinking percentage of smokers in the rearview mirror is by adjusting its growth strategy. It took a big step forward this past June when it closed on a $2.75 billion buyout of electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings.', ""To be fair, Altria flubbed badly with its sizable investment in e-vapor company Juul. But there's good reason to believe it's not making the same mistake twice with NJOY. That's because NJOY has received six marketing granted orders (MGOs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. MGOs effectively grant permission for e-vapor products to be sold. Since most e-vapor products on retail shelves lack MGOs and could, in theory, be pulled at any time, Altria's smokeless segment looks to be in phenomenal position to deliver sustained growth."", 'The third time-tested Dividend King that can help you bring home $1,000 in ultra-safe annual dividend income from an initial $19,000 investment split among three stocks is consumer staples company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). The company increased its quarterly distribution for the 62nd straight year two weeks ago.', ""The biggest headwind for Coca-Cola tends to be inflation. If the cost for ingredients and/or labor rises too quickly, or consumers have their discretionary spending constrained by the rising price of goods and services, it could threaten to reduce Coca-Cola's margins or perhaps encourage consumers to trade down to cheaper store-branded beverages. But let's face the facts: Coke wouldn't have made this list if it didn't have clearly identifiable competitive advantages working in its favor."", 'For starters, consumer staples stocks usually provide predictable operating cash flow. Although shoppers might pare back their spending on discretionary items during periods of uncertainty, beverages are a necessity in any economic climate. Coca-Cola has the distinction of being the most chosen brand from retail shelves for 10 consecutive years, according to Kantar\'s annual ""Brand Footprint"" report (as of 2022).', 'On top of being one of the most recognized and valuable consumer goods brands globally, Coca-Cola also offers virtually unsurpassed geographic diversity. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has operations ongoing in every country. This allows it to take advantage of higher organic growth rates in emerging markets, while still generating predictable cash flow in developed countries.', 'Another competitive advantage for Coca-Cola is its undeniable ability to engage with consumers. The company has devoted a sizable percentage of its marketing budget to digital ads and is relying on artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor messages for younger audiences. Meanwhile, it can lean on well-known brand ambassadors as a way to connect with its more mature consumers. Few consumer goods brands can cross generational gaps with ease and connect with people quite like Coca-Cola.', 'Lastly, Coca-Cola has historically enjoyed exceptionally strong pricing power. Though inflation does pose a risk, most consumers have been willing to absorb price increases and have stuck by the Coca-Cola brand.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Johnson & Johnson wasn’t one of them.

While dividend payments have never been the first priority of the Oracle of Omaha while looking for new investments, he does give them a lot of importance and almost always mentions his portfolio companies with growing dividends in his annual letters. In his latest annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett talked about Coca-Cola\xa0Co (NYSE:KO) and American Express\xa0Company (NYSE:AXP), in which Berkshire owns $24 billion and $28 billion worth of stakes, respectively.', '""During 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke – extending our own Rip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of AMEX earnings in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase. Both AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 – about 16% in the case of AMEX – and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the year. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell you: “No way.”', 'Though Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect ownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made at Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every asset that Berkshire owns. To this obvious but often overlooked truth, I add my usual caveat: All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done at a premium.', 'The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', 'Buffett loves it when he does not have to touch his stakes and let the investments do all the work. He believes his investments are rewarded when the companies he has invested in increase dividends and focus on shareholder returns.', 'Methodology', ""But Coca Cola and American Express aren’t the only two dividend-paying stocks in Buffett's portfolio. In this article we scanned Berkshire's Q4 portfolio and picked 15 stocks that pay dividends. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here)."", ""Warren Buffett's Stake:\xa0$840,449,860"", ""T-Mobile Us Inc(NAQSDAQ:TMUS) ranks 15th in our list of the best dividend stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett. Berkshire owns an $840 million stake in T-Mobile Us Inc (NAQSDAQ:TMUS) as of the end of 2023. In January T-Mobile Us Inc (NAQSDAQ:TMUS) posted fourth quarter results, according which T-Mobile Us Inc's (NAQSDAQ:TMUS) GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $1.67, missing estimates by $0.23. Revenue in the period inched up 1% year over year to $20.48 billion, beating estimates by $810 million."", 'ClearBridge Dividend Strategy made the following comment about T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“During the quarter we initiated positions in two new names:\xa0T-Mobile US, Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:TMUS) and Gilead Sciences. T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile’s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost. T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.', 'This combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition. In the three years since completing its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has grown its post-paid subscriber base by about 22%. Over the same period, AT&T’s has grown by about 14%, while Verizon’s by less than 5%.', 'Given the high fixed-cost nature of the wireless business, these steady increases in revenue growth have led to outsize increases in profits and free cash flow. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to come in around $13.5 billion, up from less than $8 billion last year. In 2024 free cash flow is expected to grow by over 20% to approximately $17 billion — providing a 10% yield based on today’s stock price.', 'We have long admired T-Mobile, but until recently the stock did not pay a dividend. The company announced its inaugural dividend in September, and we bought the stock shortly thereafter. The initial yield is about 2% and it is expected to grow about 10% per year.”', ""Warren Buffett's Stake:\xa0$1,193,182,000"", ""Professional services and management consulting company Aon Plc (NYSE:AON) is one of the low-yield dividend stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio.

Forward dividend yield at the time came in at 0.82%."", 'As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 57 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Aon Plc (NYSE:AON).', 'Polen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Aon plc (NYSE:AON) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:', '“AON PLC’s\xa0(NYSE:AON) stock price underperformed this past quarter following the announcement of the company’s acquisition of NFP, a middle market insurance broker, for $13 billion. Though the deal complements Aon’s current business, it is expected to be dilutive to earnings in the near term, prompting a sell-off in the shares. We will continue to assess the merits of the NFP transaction, but it does not currently change our long-term view of Aon, which we view as a steady, durable, low-teens earnings compounder.”', ""Warren Buffett's Stake:\xa0$1,635,201,454"", 'Warren Buffett has a $1.64 billion stake in Capital One Financial Corp (NYSE:COF), which is everywhere in the news since the announcement of its acquisition of Discover Financial for an eye-popping $35.3 billion.', 'Evercore ISI recently downgraded the stock to In Line from Outperform amid huge uncertainty around the Discover deal.', '""We expect uncertainty re: regulatory approval of the DFS deal, lengthy TBV [tangible book value] earnback & sizeable dilution, and lack of catalysts to limit upside to the shares,"" Evercore analyst John Pancari said in a note.', 'Sound Shore Management made the following regarding Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:', '“Long-term holding\xa0Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) was also one of our better performers this quarter. The company boasts a diversified deposits base with about 80% FDIC insured, well above industry average. It is the only major bank 100% in the cloud, which enables better underwriting and quicker response to changes in the environment. This technology also helps reduce operating and fraud cost while freeing up cash flow for reinvestment in marketing to grow products (Venture X card) and build its brand. Periods of stress, like we saw in the banking sector during March, are a reminder of the underwriting acumen and high quality deposits of Capital One. We added to our position after the fallout, knowing that the company’s seasoned management team had steered capably through previous cycles. Today, as credit card delinquencies have risen to more normal levels, Capital One is already reporting a slowing in delinquency growth. Conversely, some peers saw prior underwriting missteps begin to surface in 2023.

Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth, increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% yearon-year, progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances.

Although a significant number of patients can be cured with standard front-line therapy, many will exhibit refractory disease or relapse following an initial response and are ineligible to transplant. These patients face a very poor prognosis and need novel treatment option to improve their outcomes1.', 'According to NCCN Guidelines, Minjuvi® is listed as one of the preferred 2nd line treatments for DLBCL patients who are ineligible for transplantation2.

We look forward to continuing this momentum in 2024 with two potential approvals and commercial launches. Syndax is firmly on the path to distinguishing itself as a commercial stage mid-cap biotech company and with opportunities to expand well beyond the initial indications for revenue management axatilimab, we envision creating long-term value with these franchises for years to come. On slide 3, let me take a moment to review some recent accomplishments. With revumenib of our highly selective men in inhibitor, we made significant clinical and regulatory progress in the fourth quarter. At the 2023 American Society of Hematology annual meeting. In December, we presented robust data from the Phase on1e and Phase 2 portions of the AUGMENT-101 trial that included a late-breaking oral presentation highlighting pivotal results from the KMT2Ar acute leukemia cohort as well as multiple Phase 1 combination trials that demonstrated regiments ability to safely and effectively combined with standard of care. In late December, we announced the submission of an NDA filing for recommended under the FDA's real-time oncology review for our [Torrent] program for the treatment of adult and pediatric relapsed or refractory KMT2Ar rearranged acute leukemia. Submitting the NDA under our R/R ensures early engagement with the FDA throughout the review process, helping to derisk the submission and provide a potentially expedited time line to repeat to regimen of approval. We expect to receive a PDUFA action date for recommended this quarter, which should align with a third quarter approval date for axatilimab. Our anti CSF1R antibody. I'm excited to announce today that the FDA granted us priority review and a PDUFA action date of August 28, 2024 for the treatment of chronic graft versus host disease or GVHD after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. Positive data from the pivotal of Abu Dhabi to a one trial presented at a plenary scientific session at ASH in December formed the basis of the BLA submission. And last quarter, we also initiated a Phase two double-blind randomized clinical trial for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF that Neil will later detail in this call. Financially, we are in a very good position. We strengthened our balance sheet in the fourth quarter with an additional $258 million in cash, and Keith will go into more detail in our financials later in this call. We continue to prepare for commercialization in 2024. Our first mover advantage is of high strategic importance, and we are busy ensuring that we successfully execute first and best-in-class drug launches for revenue. We are focused on prelaunch activities and we are finalizing our go-to-market strategies for both recommended and axatilamab that we look forward to communicating in the coming months. In January, we exercised our option under our agreement with our partner Incyte to co-commercialize axatilamab in the United States and provide 30% of the commercial effort has there is a considerable benefit to promoting two products simultaneously to a highly overlapping and targeted physician prescriber universe. 2024 is shaping up to be a historical year for Syndax as we prepare to launch first, invest in class products, and I am confident that we have the expertise, resources and determination to achieve our goals. Now let's turn to slide 4, and I'll begin a recap of some recent clinical data for recommended that investigators presented at the ASH Annual Meeting in December. There was significant excitement for every manager in the reaction to the data that investigators presented, which clearly demonstrated regiment has potential to become a cornerstone for the treatment in NPM1 and KMT2A acute leukemia data presentations have translated to continued strong enrollment in our clinical trials through additional engagement in the medical community as well as additional requests for investigator-sponsored trials that could ultimately expand the use of the drug once approved. In the late breaker presentation for the AUGMENT one to one pivotal trial, we indicated that KMT2A acute leukemia patients achieved clinically significant responses to treatment with a high overall response rate of 63% and responses were observed across all major subgroups recommended delivered a high rate of deep responses with a CR CRh rate of 23%, 70% of which were MRD-negative. At the time of the data cutoff the median duration of CR Crh response was 6.4 months based on a Kaplan-Meier estimate with 46% or six patients remaining in response. Moving to slide 5 in the Augment one oh one trial, 39% of the overall responder population proceeded to a stem cell transplant, which is higher than historical benchmarks in this population of less than 5%, many of these patients proceed to transplant prior to achievement of a CR CRh at the time of the data cutoff, 71% of patients who underwent transplant had either restarted regimen of four were eligible to restart as maintenance therapy. A few of these patients had been receiving maintenance treatment for as long as eight months with several continuing on therapy, highlighting the potential for long-term treatment with revenue metrics. Physicians with whom we have engaged, are impressed by recommend its ability to use rapid tumor clearance in heavily pretreated patients, enabling many of them to undergo a potentially curative bone marrow transplant. Treating physicians have repeatedly told us told us that they want to use regimen as early as possible during treatment to bring more patients to transplant and then extend responses by continuing treatment following transplant engraftment. We've seen data and as we heard from KOLs at our ASH investor event and continue to hear from physicians today, their belief that continued use of recommended post transplant should lead to the best possible outcomes, and it is an attractive option for these patients. Turning to slide 6, the final pivotal cohort of the Augment one oh one trial continues to enroll relapsed or refractory NPM1 mutant AML patients. It is designed to enroll 64 patients and up to 20 pediatric patients with multiple presentations, highlighting the consistency of menin inhibition across NPM1 mutations and KMT2A rearrangements as a monotherapy agent and in combination with standard as standard of care, we continue to see the excitement building for revenue momentum in NPM one. We are quite pleased with the recruitment in the trial and are reaffirming our guidance of expected completion of enrollment in the late first quarter or early second quarter of this year. We expect to report top line data from the trial in the fourth quarter of 2024. And importantly, we continue to look forward to a potential approval in 2025 based on an SNDA filing for MPM, one, falling revenue manage anticipated initial approval in KMT2A acute leukemia. The Phase one MPM. One data that we've reported for recommended supports our conviction that recommended to be an important treatment for this AML population across monotherapy. And in combination, we've generated consistent results between KMT2A and NPM1 acute leukemias. In the Phase one portion of one oh one, 50% of NPM1 patients achieved an overall response and 36% achieved a CR or CRh and importantly, all patients with CR CRh were MRD-negative, consistent with the KMT2A population recommended also enabled a high percentage of NPM1 responders to proceed to transplant 43% and responses have been durable. This is despite many of the patients failing prior venetoclax therapy and receiving prior stem cell transplants. It's worth noting that revenue momentum has been well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory NPM1 AML. In the Phase one results, there were no grade four or five QT prolongations. No patients experienced more than Grade two differentiation syndrome and no patients discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events. Now turning to slide 7. We believe that revenue momentum will form the backbone of treatment for patients with KMT2A and NPM1 acute leukemias. Our clinical strategy extends beyond the initial relapse or refractory indications and into the frontline and post transplant maintenance settings through combinations with approved therapies in the frontline setting, there are basically two broad categories of patients, those who are fit and can tolerate intensive chemotherapy. And those were deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy and would traditionally receive an adequate plus a society. Our front-line strategy is to add regimented onto standard of care treatments to show that revenue momentum can be used effectively in combination, thereby increasing efficacy without negatively impacting the tolerability or safety profile of those regiments. We started combination development with venetoclax plus a decided in front-line unfit AML population in the Beat AML trial. The trial is expanding to validate the recommended Phase two doses and we expect to have an additional data update for this trial later this year. In parallel, we are planning the venetoclax plus a decided in pivotal trial that we expect to initiate by year-end to address frontline AML patients fit enough to tolerate intensive chemotherapy. We initiated a Phase one dose escalation trial of recommended in combination with standard of care induction therapy known as seven plus three. Here we also anticipate identifying an RP2D for regimen of and initiating a pivotal trial for this combination soon thereafter. On slide 8 is the data from the Beat AML trial, a Phase one trial being conducted by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. In this trial, frontline AML patients who are unfit for induction chemotherapy are dosed with a triplet regimen of venetoclax and a decided in 28 day cycles. In an interim look at data from 13 patients, 100, 100% achieved a complete remission for CRC and all patients for whom we had an MRD assessment achieved an MRD negative response. This is significantly higher than what would be expected from venetoclax plus a decided in alone based on the results of the vote via a trial where patients achieved a 66% CRC rate and only 24% achieved an MRD-negative response. Importantly, I'd like to emphasize that here. And there was no impact in the safety or tolerability observed by adding regimen to this doublet regimen. Turning to slide 9. For a minute was also evaluated in another oral venetoclax combination among patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Interim data from this trial, known as SAVE AML, was conducted by investigators from the MD Anderson Cancer Center and presented at ASH. The same trial evaluated the all oral combination of regimen of venetoclax and a fixed dose combination of decided being set as Geraldine in relapse or refractory AML or mixed phenotype acute leukemias. In the interim presentation, nine patients with either NPM1 KMT2A or NIP, 98 mutations were enrolled into the trial. These patients had received a median of three prior lines of therapy and over half of them had received prior venetoclax and prior hypomethylating agents had the interim assessment, 100% of patients achieved a response and 78% achieved a complete remission. Importantly, responses were observed across all three patient subsets, NPM1 KMT2A or 98. This triplet combination was also well tolerated at both active doses of Revlimid in the trial, including the current monotherapy RP2D two D with no new or increased safety signals observed beyond what would be expected with venetoclax and hypomethylating agent. Now to slide 10 KMT2A and NPM1 acute leukemias represent up to 40% of all AML patients. And there are no FDA approved targeted therapies for this population, inclusive of the expansion opportunities there is the potential to address upwards of 12,000 NPM1 and KMT2A acute leukemia patients across various settings. We believe relapsed or refractory KMT2A acute leukemia alone represents a $750 million market opportunity in the US, the annual incidence of KMT2A acute leukemia is about 26 hundred patients, and the majority are refractory to frontline standard of care treatments. We estimate a median duration of therapy across the treated population of approximately nine months, and we believe the clinical data supports pricing competitively with other targeted therapies in AML such as the flit three or IDH inhibitors. We anticipate that with the only age and disease agnostic label and KMT2A acute leukemia, along with no other treatment options approved in this population and no near top no near term competition revenue momentum should become the treatment of choice for patients with relapse or refractory KMT2A acute leukemia. We expect that our first mover advantage and experienced physicians will gain treating patients with revenue momentum could extend meaningfully beyond KMT2A and allow us to build a formidable franchise in the next few years, augmented by a second indication in NPM1 AML. Our market research suggests that if approved and if approved oncologists or like is it likely to prescribe recommended as either their second or third line agent of choice for the treatment of NPM1 AML. We estimate that this population would be slightly larger than the relapsed or refractory KMT2A acute leukemia population. And based on our Phase one results, we also believe overall efficacy and treatment duration will be consistent between the KMT2A and NPM1 relapsed refractory populations. Having two distinct market segments in acute leukemias available to us, KMT2A and NPM1 would create a total accessible population of somewhere between 5,000 and 6,500 patients in the relapsed refractory setting and an addressable market. And we are also investigating the opportunity to expand to solid tumors are proof of concept. Signal-seeking Phase one clinical trial in metastatic colorectal cancer is ongoing. This trial is based on preclinical science that supports the role of menin KMT2A interaction and beta containing driven tumors. We are following these patients and expect to provide an update on the on the progress of the dose escalation phase of the trial in the second quarter of 2024, we would perceive single agent activity reflected as responses or prolonged stable disease as encouraging in this third-line patient population. Let me now turn to axatilimab our monoclonal antibody targeting the CSF-1 receptor beginning on Slide 11. As noted earlier, we're thrilled that the BLA for axatilimab in adult and pediatric patients with chronic GVHD after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy has been given a PDUFA action date of August 28th, 2024, by the FDA. Data from the global pivotal agave to a one trial formed the basis for this application. The agave to a one trial, which was showcased during the plenary scientific session at ASH, met its primary endpoint of overall response rate by cycle seven day one using the 2014 NIH consensus criteria for chronic GVHD across all three dose groups. The overall response rate was 74% at a dose of 0.3 milligrams per kilogram administered every two weeks. The responses were durable with a median duration of response not yet reached at the time of data cutoff and 60% of responders were still responding at one year. Axatilimab was well tolerated in the trial with a low 6% rate of discontinuations. The most common adverse events for consistent with the on-target effects observed in prior trials. Axatilimab is differentiated from other approved therapies for chronic GVHD. In that it is the first investigational chronic GVHD treatment to target inflammation and fibrosis through the inhibition of disease associated macrophages. On slide 12, you will note that responses, including CRs, were seen across all organs involved and notably in fibrosis, dominated organs including a soft esophagus joints, fashion and lung. Over 85% of patients reported a reduction in chronic GVHD related symptom burden in agave to a one which supports the potentially pronounced impact this mechanism can have on patients suffering from chronic GVHD. These results reinforce its potential as a first and best-in-class CSF1R monoclonal antibody antibody in chronic GVHD. I'll now turn the call over to Neil speak about the IPF trial that we started in late fourth quarter as well as the scientific rationale for the use of axatilimab in IPF."", 'Neil Gallagher', ""Thank you Michael. Turning to slide 13. We're excited about the opportunity to expand the development of axatilimab into fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where the monocyte macrophage macrophage cell lineage plays a key role. Ipf is a chronic fibrosis lung disease for which there are limited treatment options when the two drugs have been approved. And both have only been shown to slow without halt or reverse disease progression. The only opportunity for a cure is lung transplant, which is limited to less than 5% of patients with the estimated US prevalence of IPF growing to over 180,000 people by 2026. There is an increasing need for new, well-tolerated and effective indications. There are several reasons why we are excited to pursue fibrotic disease outside of chronic GVHD and why we have confidence that axatilimab may provide meaningful benefit in IPF. There is al growing understanding of the important role of macrophage that macrophages play as a master regulator of the fibrotic process. There's a wealth of preclinical and clinical data indicating that the CSF1R signaling pathway may play an important role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. One such preclinical dataset from an in-vivo BlueMountain pulmonary fibrosis model is shown in the panel on the left. To be a mice model is commonly used to investigate the potential of therapies to address lung fibrosis. And in this experiment, animals were treated with an anti CSF1R antibody for saline control nine days after the administration of the amazing. The histological section on the top left shows normal lung with extensive flight airspace. Conversely, the BMIs and treated lung has extensive fibrosis, as indicated by the dark colored material striking me the lung treated with Blue Mountain and then therapeutically with an anti CSF1R antibody ND nine has significantly less fibrosis markedly preserved white airspace analysis of the extent of fibrosis using the Ashcroft score indicates indicates that significantly less damage to the lungs occurs in the presence of the anti CSF1R antibodies. Even more encouraging are the clinical data for axatilimab in patients with pulmonary manifestations of chronic GVHD for clinically notable improvements in lung function have been observed. The panel on the right shows the date originally presented at the American Thoracic Society meeting last year from patients in the Phase one two chronic GVHD trial of axatilimab who have chronic GVHD related bronchiolitis of restaurants and from our POS. As you can see most patient patients experienced improvements or slowing of decline of pulmonary function, which is very unlikely to occur spontaneously, these data in conjunction with the organ specific data from the agave to a one trial presented earlier strongly support the therapeutic potential of axatilimab in interstitial lung diseases, including IPF. Turning to slide 14. Here, we lay out the design of our recently initiated multinational Phase two trial of axatilimab in IPF is a 26 week double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center trial, which aims to include 135 patients, randomized two to one to receive 0.3 milligrams per kilogram of axatilimab every two weeks are placebo on a background of standard of care. Primary endpoint is the annualized rate of decline in forced vital capacity of SEC Key secondary endpoints include disease progression, quality of life specific to patients with obstructive airways disease. We believe this study is robustly designed to demonstrate proof-of-concept for axatilimab in IPF, thereby enabling us to advance the molecule into Phase three pivotal development potential. Let me now turn the call back to Michael."", 'Michael Metzger', ""Thank you, Neil. For Turning now to slide 15, which highlights the broad clinical and commercial opportunity for axatilimab. Approximately 14,000 U.S. patients suffer from chronic GVHD, 50% of whom require treatment beyond second line due to disease progression inadequate response for disease manifestations that aren't wholly address with current treatments. There are no cures for this advanced population of chronic GVHD patients and patients who are initially treated with corticosteroids are then cycled through a variety of additional therapies. While patients may be treated with any of the approved therapies, the order in which they are used may depend on the physician's experience with how a given agent may address specific manifestations of the disease. Newer entrants, jackup find reservoir rock have had successful commercial launches, which speaks to the unmet need in chronic GVHD and a substantial commercial opportunity for a differentiated agent such as axatilimab axatilimab suppresses monocyte derived macrophage activation and proliferation, which may provide more comprehensive control of the disease and currently approved therapies. Addressing inflammation and fibrosis in one mechanism of action is a key differentiator and also supports moving axatilamab earlier in the treatment paradigm to potentially prevent organ damage before it occurs because axatilimab is an antibody drug-drug interactions are expected to be minimal and axatilimab unique mechanism of action may offer the benefit of being an ideal combination partner with standard of care therapies currently used for the treatment of chronic GVHD. The opportunity to expand to ex U.S. markets into other high-value indications could build significant additional value for axatilimab over the next few decades. We're looking forward to the insight led initiation of additional trials of axatilimab, including a Phase two combination trial with Jakafi and a Phase three combination trial with corticosteroids, which is expected to commence in mid-2024. I'll now turn the call over to Keith to review our financial results."", 'Keith Goldan Goldan', ""Thank you, Michael. Turning to slide 16, as Michael mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet, adding $258 million, providing strong validation of the Dexus potential from both existing as well as new high-quality institutional investors for $600 million on the balance sheet at year end is expected to provide cash runway through 2026. Turning to the income statement. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $77.9 million, comprised of $55.1 million of research and development expense and $22.8 million of selling general and administrative expense in line with guidance. Looking forward, our financial strength enables us to focus on the execution of advancing our pipeline and achieving an exceptional launch of revenue momentum and axatilamab later this year, keeping in mind that we've always embraced a disciplined approach to resource allocation. I'd like to provide financial guidance for the first quarter and full year 2020 for the first quarter, the company expense expects research and development expense to be $56 million to $62 million and total operating expenses to be $82 million to $88 million. For the full year 2024, the company expects research and development expenses to be $240 million to $60 million and total operating expenses to be $355 million to $375 million, including approximately $43 million of non-cash stock compensation expense. So with that, let me now turn the call back over to Michael."", 'Michael Metzger', ""Thank you, Keith. As you have heard during the call, 2023 was a landmark year for growth and execution, as evidenced by our positive pivotal trial readouts and two regulatory submissions for our two lead drug candidates, both of which are first and potentially best-in-class treatments. This is only the beginning of what's to come for Syndax. We are in a significant transition into a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company serving multiple patient populations of high unmet need. Both programs offer the potential for broad franchise opportunities beyond their initial registration indications adding to Syndax is long-term growth potential. We have ambitious goals and milestones that I've set out for 2024 and that are laid out on slide 17. I'm confident that we have the right plan and team in place to execute on that. As always, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to the Syndax team collaborators and most importantly, the patients, trial sites and investigators involved with our clinical programs through your important work, we are getting closer to delivering on our mission of improving the lives of patients with cancer and I'd also like to thank our committed, long-term investors who continue to share in our vision and support us in building Syndax without and I'd like to open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Peter Lawson, Barclays.', 'Peter Lawson', ""It is Jay on for Peter. Congrats on all the progress. But as for axatilimab, can you comment on expectations for your launch in 3Q and related to that it sounds like you're still expecting the 3Q potential approval for the Bandon inhibitor. We're expecting that to be potentially positioned for sales in 3Q and potentially dependent on new receipts early here? Thank you."", 'Michael Metzger', 'Thanks, Jay, for the question. So first, first off on, I think you broke up a little bit on the on the second question, Tom, you want to take the first one is your home.', 'Keith Goldan Goldan', ""So thanks for the question. Seamus is key. So some for axatilimab. Q3, we have the PADOVA and when the FDA actually approves the drug is still a question. As we've laid out earlier in the year, we've opted into the co-promotion and as Michael said earlier, to the co-promotion of axatilimab. So we'll be ready with our sales force prior to the approval of either product. So as you can see by looking at linked and are looking at our website in the career section, we're currently recruiting for all of the territory managers on. So that's public knowledge, will have them onboard and trained up prior to approval of either product. With respect to your question around the timing of the initiation of revenue net of revenue. We'll have to wait until later this quarter when we received the PDUFA date for this action date from the from the agency and I think at that time, we'll have a better idea of when do you expect the initiation of revenue net of revenues? Does that answer your question?"", 'Operator', 'Anupam Rama, JPMorgan.', 'Anupam Rama', 'Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe expanding on comments. Just now just remind us of where you are in terms of the sales force sales team build-out, what are your some of your pre-commercial kind of plans here in the near term? And then maybe just on expenses, how we think about the growth here quarter over quarter looking to 2024, especially on the SG&A line as we think about the launches?', 'Michael Metzger', ""Hey Ram, thanks for the question. I'll maybe I'll take the first part in terms of sales force build-out, and then I'll leave the rest to key sensor. So I think as we said in the past, we're building out our commercial organization to accommodate both the launch of regimen of and now we've opted into the at the co-promote with insight around axatilamab to provide up to 30% of the of the FTEs for that effort. I would say overlapping, as I said my remarks, overlapping and highly targeted call point. And so the opportunity here is with roughly 40 to 50 representatives to cover the US quite extensively and also cover both products. So caps that the build-out of that sales force will continue until the time of right up until we have approval on both agents, which as Keith mentioned, we have a twofer at the end of August for axatilimab, and we expect to produce imminently for regimen as well. So we have, yes, we'll be ready well in advance of some of both of those two to put the sales force in place and leadership has been hired and is doing extensive work to get ready. Maybe, Keith, you want to handle the second one here."", 'Keith Goldan Goldan', ""So Unpublic respect to your question on SG&A expense, and we gave guidance today on total OpEx for the year $355 million to $375 million. That includes non-cash stock comp and then for R&D and the $240 million to $260 million. So based on that, you can assume it's circa 100, slightly higher in total SG&A for the year for the year, on last year we ended the year SG&A totaling about $67 million and about $22 million of that is in the was in the fourth quarter. So you the reps, I think you can assume we're recruiting now. I think it would be a reasonable assumption to assume they're definitely onboard for the second half of the year in advance of both launches. I'll take a take a reasonable cost per rep per year and add that on. And I think you can pretty simply kind of work out the math of the SG&A growth for the year, up from $66 million, $67 million this year to 100 next year. And given the fact that we've given for first quarter guidance of total OpEx and R&D expenses will be up, definitely this is the second half of the year will be the on the addition no commercial field force. And we have the G&A infrastructure in place from HR, finance IT. That infrastructure is well in place. So it's going to be the reps plus the A&P to go with that."", 'Anupam Rama', 'Thanks so much for taking our questions.', 'Michael Metzger', 'Thanks, Anupam.', 'Operator', 'Phil Nadeau, TD Cowen', 'Phil Nadeau', ""Definitely, and thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the progress. A couple on the ASH data and then a follow-up on axatilimab. So in terms of the ASH data and there are two controversial aspects that we keep debating with investors and curious to hear your thoughts on those first and CAML. I know you said that there was no additive toxicity by having adding regimen a bit to the background regimen, not everyone agrees. So could you address like the neutropenia rates that you would expect I think you showed 56% at ASH would ASTX 77% do alone. And then second on BAML, again, there's some concerns about the combinability, particularly the dose of revenue momentum going forward in light of the SIP interaction? And then in the event has how will you determine the Phase two dose through BAML., what type of dose adjustments would you anticipate once that Phase two dose is found?"", 'Michael Metzger', ""Phil, thanks for the question. And I think I'm going to turn it over to Neil. So he can make a comment first about save. And then he'll and I'll address the question. You brought up about a PDM, our thinking."", 'Neil Gallagher', ""So I think the first thing to remember is that the trial, the safety trial accrued a very heavily pretreated population. So two thirds of patients had failed prior van, a third have been or half of over half of them have been transplanted. So this is a patient population. The median number of prior therapies is of three to four and therefore, the cytopenia rate that was observed is according to the investigators and not only the investigators in the study, but others entirely consistent with what you would expect with Van and oral side have been in that particular patient population. I mean, if there's been some comparison to a less heavily pretreated population that that may be in people's minds, that's just not a valid comparison. You have to look at the patient population that was included in the trial. And therefore, that's why we can the investigator has stated his confidence and we agree with them that started the cytopenia rate was consistent with what would be expected from the backbone and in terms of feeding them out, I'm not sure as I've done so I understand that. I understand why you think that there's a challenge around dose selection both. So just to reiterate for the entire audience, there were two doses of regimen of tested in all three of the combination trials that we reported out at the investor event at ASH, right, or where it was also reported at ASH itself. And the analysis was presented independently of our event as well. So the two doses that were included in all three combination trials were 113 milligrams. It twice a day and 163 milligrams twice a day different patient population. Obviously, in the B to B and AML trial, there were newly diagnosed save. We've just discussed they were heavily pretreated relapsed refractory and an augment one or two, there were heavily pretreated relapsed refractory patients. And in all three trials, dose-limiting toxicity windows for both doses were cleared. Okay. So and in it with respect to BD&L on board the group is now doing is expanding those cohorts to further refine what the RP2D would be for a Phase three trial. And we stated many times publicly that it is our intention to proceed with our Phase three by the end of the year. So just on just one final point, those two doses, 113 and 163 milligrams is the presumptive monotherapy full dose when administered with a strong support for inhibitor. Okay. And 113 milligrams is also highly active. And also you have to recall that venetoclax and a decided in the Beat AML trial was administered at does. So there's, the it's there's no question in our mind that the combinability of regimen of with venaza in the newly diagnosed setting as well as in the other two settings, it's clear that's very helpful."", 'Phil Nadeau', 'Makes it clear. And then last question, just on axatilamab sales and marketing. I think in your prepared remarks, you said Syndax is responsible for 30% of the marketing efforts in the answer, I think to uninformed question, you said 30% of FTEs. How are the marketing efforts? How is 30% of marketing efforts defined? Is that specifically 30% of the fees or are there other metrics that this index needs to deliver as well, such as some touch points with physicians or call points or something else?', 'Michael Metzger', 'I turn it over to Keith, could you tell thanks for the question.', 'Keith Goldan Goldan', ""So apologies if I wasn't clear if we weren't clear. So the our partnership agreement with Incyte stipulates that we have the ability to contribute 30% of the promotional effort. So from a from a sales call point perspective, we'll be delivering 30% of that effort. So I mentioned it before in FTEs because I don't want to speak like in the number of reps, but we will be delivering 30% of that of that sales force effort. But don't forget, it's a combined P&L, right? So we'll put our 30% of the cost of that 30% of it into the combined P&L. Incyte will put their 70% of the cost of their effort into the P&L. And then any advertising promotion expenses incurred by Incyte because they are taking the lead from that perspective, would go into that of joint P&L and that join the bottom of that joint P&L quote, the commercial profitability of the product is split 50%, 50% perfectly because, sorry, percentage pickup? (multiple speakers)"", 'Operator', 'Bradley Canino, Stifel.', 'Bradley Canino', ""Good afternoon. Provided peak sales opportunities, but how do you see the KMT2Ar. launch playing out this year, things in terms of number of patients that are available in the relapsed refractory setting where they're concentrated and what to back for the pace of uptake?"", 'Michael Metzger', ""Brad, thanks for the question. I think maybe a little early to start speculating about the sales ramp and projection, and we'll reserve the ability to give a little bit more guidance because we get closer to commercialization. I think gum, as we stated in our remarks, we think it's a KMT2A is a really, yes, it's a compelling opportunity commercially in the sense that we'll have a first to market best-in-class products to address patients even earlier than they were tested in the clinical trials. So we're talking 26 hundred patients overall, probably about 2000 of which are treated in the relapsed refractory setting. We believe that we'll have the opportunity to address the vast majority of those patients. And as we've pointed out in previous discussions that these patients are in dire need of therapy, many of them can go to transplant, hopefully through the use of them. So even with that with revenue momentum and then potentially back on treatment in a post transplant setting. So there is, we think, a highly addressable population. Physicians seem to be quite motivated to use the drug. And so we've seen that in our trials, but we've also heard that from physicians. So I think this sets up as a really interesting new opportunity for a drug to come to market with really no competition at the current point at this current point, too, to get in the way of a very successful launch. So that's where we are. We see it today in terms of some projections and launch and ramp multiples, we preserve that for feature discussion."", 'Operator', 'Michael Schmidt, Guggenheim.', 'Michael Schmidt', ""Thanks for taking my question. I had one on the on the first-line setting for every minute in combination with seven plus three. And in your opinion, what is the right way to come to view our front-line combo data with menin inhibitors and seven plus three? And specifically given that arm one would expect very high CR rates, presumably on top of seven plus three already. And what are what are other benchmarks that you said you're looking for in your own study, including MRD status, for example, transplant rates or any other efficacy measures that are important in your opinion?"", 'Michael Metzger', ""And Michael, thanks for the question. An important one, certainly to get a handle on. I think the seven plus three regimen, as you know, is highly effective in frontline patients. Npm1 and KMT2A patients initially respond. Upwards of 80% of patients respond to those treatment treatments. However, they don't usually respond for long. So there's a relapse that happens with most of those patients and things to look for beyond just CR rates of CR CRh, of course, would be with the MRD. and transplant rates, which we would be looking for. Obviously, we've seen high rates of both in relapse refractory patients. Now we're moving, it would be moving to frontline and you'd expect to see some equal or better rates of MRD and certainly transplant in earlier-line settings. And so I think that's the those are some really important measures, duration of treatment, of course, seven plus three, the short course, the ability to treat with regimented and keep patients in remission for an extended period of time is obviously something that we'd want to own. We want to see, of course, if it's new days rising, we haven't you haven't seen or amended inhibitor perform in the frontline seven plus three as of yet. So I think it would be up to us to kind of set the trend for what the what the bar looks like there. But certainly from a CRM perspective, from a safety perspective, you kind of know what you want to see relatively clean, relatively clean profile and highly effective, but you need to continue on and should see deep durable responses as well there. Neil, do you want to."", 'Neil Gallagher', ""I think yes, maybe just two things I would add to that, and I think there may have been a regulatory context to the question about what the what the what the potential endpoint could be. It's certainly too soon to talk about that. I think Michael has, as mentioned are MRD-negative. Cr is not as certainly an endpoint of it of interest. Whether or not it's it could be an approvable endpoint remains to be seen and we will of course, be engaging in discussions with the agency down as we move closer to having now initiated our dose-ranging trial as we move closer to initiating our Phase three trial. And then the only other add that out that I would make would be if you look at the seven plus three trials that have been conducted really over the last, yes, sort of 10 years to 12 years come back. As far as Mytesi bindable, people included maintenance phases and you could assume that any seven plus three trial that we would conduct would also include the maintenance season. And in support of that, what we have seen recall that what we've seen in the relapsed refractory setting post-transplant is patients who remained on therapy for protracted periods of time speaking to the tolerability of revenue manage in a relapsed refractory setting. And therefore, we anticipate that as we move towards the newly diagnosed setting that patients who would be, for instance, given monotherapy maintenance after induction consolidation therapy would probably would most likely a tolerated medicine very well as well, partnering the molecule."", 'Michael Schmidt', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Michael Metzger', 'Thank you, Michael.', 'Operator', 'Yigal Nochomovitz, Citi.', 'Yigal Nochomovitz', ""Hi, guys. This is our share of our company and thanks for taking my questions. I had a few on axatilimab. I guess first, congrats on the producer date. I'm just wondering how involved you are in the regulatory process from this point out. Obviously, we know Incyte is leading the proceedings, will it be part of the mid-cycle review? Will you be able to weigh in on label negotiations? How should we think about that?"", 'Michael Metzger', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, we're very involved with, obviously with our axatilimab, we've we generated the data and it's been a very close collaboration with Incyte. And so we are involved in the regulatory process and are working with them closely to get this drug approved in all facets. So things you're thinking about label negotiations and things like that. We are, I'd say, suffice to say, very involved with some with what's going on so that an exciting development for the Company. And obviously, we have great experience with the molecule and want to think that we are involved. So that's certainly what it is. Was there another second part of your question or was that did I cover notebook, but it's very clear."", 'Yigal Nochomovitz', ""I wanted to ask another one on IPF maybe I'm forgetting or So put simply, I just I remember this from prior calls, but we I know you're evaluating the 0.3 mg per kg dose, which was obviously the dose that look best and agave to tool. I'm just wondering what kind of gives you confidence that's the right dose specifically for IPF. I guess, why didn't you need to do dose optimization work? Or is the disease biology really similar enough that you felt confident enough not to do that? And obviously, we're dealing with a different endpoint here. So just curious what your thoughts are."", 'Neil Gallagher', ""Sorry, but I'll take your question. So no, it's a good question. We did have a long, a long discussion internally about the dose selection. So a couple of things that you quite clearly, the 0.3 milligram dose and agave in the agave trial was superior to the other two doses and we don't need to sort of go back over that. It's quite clearly the superior dose in terms of in terms of efficacy as well as tolerability and what we have talked about a number of times over the past year and particularly before we announced the details of the IPF proof-of-concept trial that we talked about today was that we were looking for an efficient and efficient trial design. And therefore, the most efficient trial design, which would get us to a sort of robust proof of concept answer you efficiently, meaning efficiently in terms of it is the design of the trial, but also in the time to execute the trial was the one that we've described today. And we felt that on the balances of the balance of everything that it was reasonable to go ahead with one dose in this trial and dose should be 0.3 milligrams. I think one point that you alluded to? Yes, I think that there is sufficient overlap from a biological perspective to have made that decision, and that sort of partly led us to that to add to that to that decision."", 'Michael Metzger', ""And maybe I'd add onto that, you probably know that we did extensive dose ranging in the course of the Phase one as well as the pivotal trial. We've also looked at early on we looked at the healthy volunteers. We know how this antibody behaves and so the effect that that it has on the macrophage and so I think the understanding the pharmacology here and therefore how we think it would translate to patients in IPF kind of gave us some, I think, some good confidence that 0.3 would be the appropriate dose in addition to what Neil has added."", 'Yigal Nochomovitz', 'Very helpful. Thanks very much.', 'Operator', 'Jason Zamansky, Bank of America.', 'Jason Zamansky', ""Hey guys, this is Alex Hammond on for Jason. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciating it's somewhat early, but with regards to your regular regulatory submission for aluminum. Can you provide some color on what you expect to be included in the label? Are the eight efficacy evaluable ALLN PAL. patients with a 12.5% CR CRH. enough to warrant a tumor agnostic label? And what are your base case expectations on potential safety monitoring requirements for the U.S. and QTc prolongation? Thank you."", 'Michael Metzger', ""So maybe I'll turn it over to Neil. We talk a little bit about the label and then maybe talk about any kind of safety."", 'Neil Gallagher', ""Sure, our anticipation is that the label I mean and maybe to precise, what I'm about to say by reminding everyone that we got PTD. back in December 2022 for it came to 2A, AML and ALL adults and kids. So the development program move impact moving forward from there. And that was based on Phase one data. The development program moving forward from there. It was based around our premise that we would have a potential for a broad indication. As you know, we actually pooled Cohort 2A and 2B and the submission for came to a relapsed acute leukemias and is based on that pooled analysis, which of course includes AML, ALL, it also as well as pediatric patients so our anticipation is, of course, the agency has been fully unlocked is sort of coming on that journey with us along the way, including from BTB. four BT. through VTD. and onwards. So that's the indication that we're looking for. So not the exact words, but KMT2A rearranged acute leukemias in adults and children. With respect to your second question about safety monitoring. And we don't we so first of all. So from a class perspective, our broad class, meaning targeted therapies in AML, we are we anticipate we would probably anticipate a boxed warning for differentiation syndrome since that is typical of some of these agents in class, right it's on target. And then what happens is even if the agency knows what happens to us such that we do not anticipate we anticipate a warning and precaution for (technical difficulty)"", 'Operator', 'Kalpit Patel, B. Riley.', 'Kalpit Patel', ""Yes, hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple on the seven plus three combo study. Can you give us some color on what dose of regimen you're planning to start with? And then second question is how should we think about the enrollment split between the KMT2A are and the NPM1 population in that combo study, would it be a 50 50 split? Or are you still are you anticipating is skewing of the KMP to a patient or is there more?"", 'Michael Metzger', ""Yes, yes, maybe I'll take the second question, I'll give the first one to Neil. . So I think that's I think you just said it in terms of KMT2A versus NPM1, we don't really know but I think it's there became KMT2A. patients overall are more fit than that onset, right? So that's where they skew, whether or not we have no skewing in our population of patients to KMT2A or not. We don't know at this point, but we do expect representation of both. Neil, do you want to talk about the seven plus three combo starting dose."", 'Neil Gallagher', ""So and just I just one thing to add on. It doesn't really matter how you split between came to an NPM1 patients in the first instance, right? But for actually seeking to discontinue is the combinability of revenue managed with seven plus three and on the as we mentioned a little bit earlier on the call and all of the combination trials that we've described thus far, there have been two doses tested 113 milligrams and 163 milligrams. And those are the doses or the equivalent doses with active three or four ads at a strong two, three four that we will be testing in the seven plus three trial as well. I mean, we know we know, based on the comments that we made earlier on and the data that we've presented for, we know that there combinable with and with chemotherapy and also Synetics Rackspace does HMA therapy."", 'Operator', 'Justin Zelin, BTIG LLC.', 'Justin Zelin', ""Great. Thanks for taking our question. This is Jeet Mukherjee on for Justin, maybe just coming back to axatilimab was, I'm hoping you could provide a little bit of a sense of the opportunity for axatilimab in IPF subset of patients, perhaps best suited for this therapy? And what should we be looking for from an efficacy perspective?"", 'Michael Metzger', ""Yes, I don't have Anjali, you want to take that question?"", 'Anjali Ganguli Ganguli', ""Yes, sure. I can cite in data. I will preface this by saying that we need a little bit more efficacy data to really hone in what the expectation, but I think we know that, as Neil mentioned on the call, there's two drugs that are approved and though a lot of patients cycled through both of them and sometimes see them added on to one another. All they do is slow the decline. They're not actually treating the disease. And so there is still a huge and then need in them in the marketplace. There are a very large number of IPF patients out there today, even in the US alone. And we would expect to be able to either we're doing the trial to add on to standard of care. So we'd be looking at a second or third line utilization. And I think we would we would expect based on positive data to get significant uptake in that population because of the large unmet need."", 'Justin Zelin', ""Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just one more on axatilimab. Just any additional color perspective on the combo studies you're doing with ruxolitinib and steroids in collaboration with Incyte? And just what should be looking there from an efficacy and safety perspective to move one or both of those forward ultimately?"", 'Michael Metzger', 'Angela, you want to follow on there?', 'Anjali Ganguli Ganguli', ""Yes, sure. So again, it's axatilimab bringing this drug fibrotic affect to bear on patients and hopefully helping to manage the impact of the disease on organs and therefore, potentially shifting the course of the disease is what we're trying. What we're trying to change with that combination therapies are moving up earlier. Could you really have a bigger impact on patients and their overall disease profile going forward. We anticipate getting some data out of this trial in the coming years, and I think that would govern what the uptake would really look like, but and this is something that physicians are telling us they're really looking for right now. The only thing they have is steroids, and unfortunately, those do as much time as they do good. And so if you could if you could get strong efficacy out of that combination, could you minimize the use of steroids and bring axatilimab up to an earlier population. I mean, we know the current estimated prevalence pool is about 14,000 patients. And so you could access a big chunk of that population. It's good data."", 'Justin Zelin', 'Thanks for taking our next question.', 'Operator', 'George Farmer, Scotiabank.', 'George Farmer', ""Hi there. This is clearly on for George. Thank you for taking our questions. On two from us on revenue momentum. So I do you have any sense on whether the FDA is intending to hold an ODAC meeting to discuss the approval package in KMT2A are AML RELM's? And secondly, could you speak to that next for other indications for Rocky Mountain?"", 'Michael Metzger', ""Frankly, thank you for the question. So entrance there and over the half. We don't expect that the FDA will hold another deck for. But I think that from time to time for new mechanisms, they do that more as a showcase than they do for any other reason, but we don't expect and we haven't received any word from the estimates indicate that we would have no deck. So I think if you answer your first question. And then secondly, you had asked about prospects for additional indications at present that is outside of leukemia. And as I mentioned in my previous remarks, we are looking at axatilimab or sorry, recommended. And then in colorectal disease, third-line metastatic colorectal cancer as a monotherapy agent, albeit obviously a very difficult disease state. And we're going to have some data in the second quarter of this year to first get out whether there's sufficient activity there as a monotherapy agent and how and how the drug performs if this thesis that we're pursuing a beta continuing upregulated in tumor types, which is a broadly implicated phenomenon to have a lot of different cancers, colorectal cancers, lung cancer. There could be other cancers that we will look to see whether they're susceptible to recommended treatments. So stay tuned.

At Sempra, we're focused on making disciplined investments in large and growing economic markets that are looking to modernize their energy networks and connect communities to safer, more reliable and cleaner energy. Over the last five years, this strategy has allowed us to build significant scale into our business for the benefit of customers and shareholders. As we previewed on our third quarter call in November, I'm excited to announce that our capital plan has increased by 20% to a new company record of $48 billion with more than 90% allocated to regulated transmission and distribution investments."", ""Trevor, Allen and Justin will go into more detail later in today's presentation, but the overall scope and size of our capital plan really speaks to the robust markets we operate in and the magnitude of the growth opportunities that are in front of our company. Turning to our 2023 financial results, we delivered adjusted EPS of $4.61 exceeding the high-end of our guidance and providing support to narrow our full year 2024 EPS guidance range to $4.60 to $4.90. This morning, we're also announcing full year 2025 EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $5.25, which represents approximately 7% growth from the midpoint of the prior guidance range. Based upon the continued growth we're seeing across our three T&D growth platforms, we're affirming our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%."", ""Finally, we're also pleased to announce the Board of Directors approved increase in our dividend for the 14th consecutive year to $2.48 per share. Please turn to the next slide. For the past several years, the United States has experienced significant economic uncertainty due to higher inflation, supply chain disruptions and higher interest rates. Against this backdrop, Sempra delivered strong financial performance in 2023 with record adjusted earnings and record adjusted earnings per share. Also over the last several years, our investment strategy has consistently prioritized making investments in energy networks in California and Texas, and this has allowed us to grow our rate base in those markets at the end of 2023 to just over $50 billion."", ""Looking forward, one of the primary benefits of rolling out an expanded capital plan is that it provides unique visibility to the strength of our long-term earnings growth. Also, it's important to note that our equity offering last November was successful in mitigating future equity needs associated with our new plan. On the regulatory front, we've made several advances highlighting the constructive nature of the jurisdictions where we operate and our ability to work effectively with key stakeholders. In California, the cost of capital mechanism triggered as a result, SDG&E and SoCalGas increased their authorized ROEs last month. We also reached a proposed settlement with certain interveners for a portion of our pending rate cases, which we view constructively."", ""Turning to Texas, Oncor successfully completed its base rate review last spring. Also several important pieces of legislation were passed that support new investments in transmission and distribution that benefit customers and the continued growth of the state's economy. Also at Sempra Infrastructure, we declared positive FID on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, secured financing and began construction. We continue to make steady progress on our development projects. While the pause on non-FTE export permits has impacted the sector, we're confident in the commercial value of our projects and we'll continue to develop these critical infrastructure assets on a reasonable timeline. Justin will address this topic further in his section. Please turn to the next slide."", 'Sempra is building critical new infrastructure designed to support economic and population growth while providing attractive financial returns to our owners. Through 2050, global GDP is expected to more than double, much of which will come from emerging economies, driving the need for incremental energy resources. Going forward, we strongly believe renewables, natural gas and cleaner molecules will be critical in meeting rising energy demand as we transition to an energy future with lower carbon intensity. As an example, United States natural gas production set a record during 2023 for the third consecutive year, fueled by strong domestic demand and record LNG exports, all while still achieving lower carbon emissions over the past several decades as renewables and cleaner burning natural gas replace coal as a fuel source in power generation.', ""Please turn to the next slide. As we modernize our energy grids, the IEA estimates that $11 trillion are expected to be spent in the North American energy sector through 2050, with over $5 trillion focused on T&D investments. Please turn to the next slide. As we've outlined in the past, we've been disciplined and maintaining our focus on what we believe is the higher value, lower risk portion of the energy value chain. In the T&D segment, we make disciplined investments with the view toward producing high quality recurring cash flows from regulated utilities and long-term contracted assets that generally grow with inflation. Please turn to the next slide. As you can see here, our strategy combined with disciplined capital allocation has allowed us to successfully meet or exceed our EPS guidance range for the last 6 years."", ""Over the same time period, our adjusted EPS has compounded annually at approximately 10% since 2018, which is top decile amongst our peers. Please turn to the next slide. Improving our corporate strategy has allowed us to build significant scale into our business for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. And that's been demonstrated by the consistency of our financial performance. It's also noteworthy that we've accomplished this across different market cycles that have included a global pandemic, supply chain shortages, high inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical unrest. In short, our disciplined execution has consistently delivered total shareholder returns at levels that are well above our peer group. Please turn to the next slide."", ""Before I hand the call to Trevor, I'd like to reiterate our key investment highlights. We own high quality T&D growth platforms located in California and Texas and some of North America's most attractive economic markets that also benefit from constructive regulation. We exercise a disciplined approach to capital allocation and are excited to launch our new 5-year capital plan of $48 billion. We believe this sets out a clear roadmap for our future growth and supports our expected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. In conclusion, we're proud of our recent accomplishments and the growing strength of our business franchise. Across our management team, there's a lot of excitement about the opportunities that are ahead of us. Now please turn to the next slide where Trevor who will walk you through the business updates at Sempra California."", ""Trevor Mihalik: Thanks, Jeff. Let me start by highlighting the financial results at Sempra California. Earnings for the full year 2023 were $1.75 billion benefiting from $4.6 billion of capital investments focused on safety, reliability and wildfire mitigation. These investments increased rate base by 11% over 2022. We have long emphasized California's constructive regulatory compact including forward looking rate cases, access to the cost of capital mechanism and an established wildfire fund. And this year, we had several positive regulatory outcomes that reinforced our conviction and supports attracting capital to the state. As Jeff mentioned, last fall the cost of capital mechanism triggered and the CPUC approved increasing our authorized ROE at SDG&E and SoCalGas by 70 basis points."", ""This increase was effective January 1, 2024. In October, we reached settlements for important capital and O&M portions of our rate case requests with certain interveners. And while these settlements are subject to CPUC approval, we're encouraged by that progress. And we anticipate receiving a proposed decision on our GRC in the second quarter. As a reminder, once finalized rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2024. Separately, in addition to the recently awarded transmission projects by CAISO, SDG&E has advanced their competitive bid for the Imperial Valley to the north of SONGS transmission line and expect an update in late April. We're also extremely proud of the recent recognition of our electric business. SDG&E was again awarded best in the West for Electric Reliability for the 18th consecutive year and recognized for their industry leadership in wildfire mitigation predictive modeling technology."", ""The CPUC also recently increased the authorized storage capacity of Aliso Canyon by over 50%. This demonstrates the Commission's recognition of the importance of existing energy infrastructure and the critical role SoCalGas plays in supporting reliability and affordability of both natural gas and electricity in California. And finally, ARCHES, which is one of SoCalGas' strategic partners was selected to receive DOE funding to help develop a regional hydrogen hub. This is important because Los Angeles is one of the nation's largest manufacturing hubs and cleaner molecules are expected to play a pivotal role in helping hard to electrify sector lower their emissions. Please turn to the next slide. Now let's turn to some of the key trends that are supporting growth at Sempra California."", ""We operate in the largest U.S. market representing nearly 15% of national GDP. California is also among the top three states for job growth with nearly 1 million jobs created over the past 5 years. We're also well aligned with the state policy that promotes building an economy based on sustainable energy. Earlier this month, the CPUC made further commitments to renewables mandating the construction of 56 gigawatts of new clean energy by 2035 including over 15 gigawatts of energy storage. California also remains home to the largest source of solar power and the highest penetration rate of electric vehicles of any state in the country. Just in San Diego County, there are now over 140,000 EVs and that number is expected to increase significantly in the coming years."", ""It is also noteworthy that San Diego County leads the state with 23% of our customers having installed rooftop solar systems. These systems are often accompanied by a battery and as battery storage solutions become more cost effective, the need to reliably integrate these technologies on our network is expected to increase. Turning to Los Angeles, The manufacturing sector generates over $80 billion in annual GDP. For customers that require high heat content molecules, RNG and hydrogen will be increasingly important for affordable, reliable and safe operations. When you pair California's economic growth with its ambitious clean energy goals, the need for significant T&D investment is critical to help ensure reliability and affordability. The key takeaway here is that our investment strategy and the rate case filings are closely aligned with public policy and the direction the state is going."", ""Please turn to the next slide. Sempra California is modernizing the T&D infrastructure necessary to integrate more renewables and clean molecules to serve the growing energy needs of customers, while facilitating California's energy transition. As this slide shows, our utilities play a central role in connecting new cleaner sources of energy to a diverse and growing set of customers. We continue to prioritize safety and reliability with a strong focus on maintaining an efficient cost structure. We currently have the lowest build relative to our peers in the state and are in line with the national average. We will always be focused on providing the best possible service while ensuring customer affordability is a top priority. Please turn to the next slide."", ""Turning to our five year capital plan. We're announcing over $24 billion of investments. On the electric side, we are pursuing safe and reliable infrastructure investments, integrating renewable energy, incorporating battery storage, supporting EV infrastructure and hardening the system against event risks. On our natural gas system, we will continue to modernize our gas network, reduce carbon emissions and make investments in energy infrastructure that support the delivery of cleaner molecules. We expect these investments to grow our rate base at an approximate 7% CAGR from 2023 to 2028. We're excited about the growth prospects at Sempra California and we feel fortunate to have the opportunity to deliver safe and reliable energy in a market with a constructive regulatory environment."", ""Please turn to the next slide where Allen will discuss Oncor's accomplishments in Texas."", ""Allen Nye : Thank you, Trevor. Oncor delivered strong financial performance in 2023, deploying $3.8 billion of capital and growing rate base by 12% over the prior year. We were pleased to complete our base rate review at the PUCT and emerged with a constructive outcome where all prior T&D investments by Oncor were deemed prudent and approved. 2023 also marked one of the most successful Texas legislative sessions for our industry in recent history. Several bills that were passed during the 88th Texas legislative session demonstrate the state's commitment to supporting a safer, smarter, more resilient and more reliable electric grid to power continued growth across the state. Oncor has historically worked closely with the Texas Legislature and its many stakeholders to achieve productive outcomes, but this session in particular was incredibly constructive."", ""First, the legislature increased our allowed distribution cost recovery tracker filings to twice a year reducing Oncor's regulatory lag on critical investments. Additionally, the legislature passed HB 2555 which encourages utilities to make their systems more resilient and provides expedited recovery for approved capital and O&M expenditures. The PUCT finalized rules to implement HB 2555 last month. We expect to file our first system resiliency plan or SRP within the next several months. The PUCT is allowed six months to review the SRP, and if approved, we would expect to begin implementation by year end. Distribution capital approved in the SRP will be recovered through our DCRF tracker filings. Regulatory lag that normally accrues between the time of in service and the implementation of rates will be offset by a regulatory asset that will be recovered in our next DCRF."", ""Similarly, O&M expense approved as part of the SRP will be offset by a regulatory asset that will be included for recovery in a subsequent DCRF. Use of this new mechanism should reduce the regulatory lag normally associated with these types of expenditures. We look forward to using the capital in O&M that gets approved under our SRP plan to improve the resiliency of our system, harden the system against storms, extreme weather and wildfire risk, and generally improve our customers' experience, while at the same time improving recovery of the expenditures. From an operational perspective, Oncor continued to execute at a high level. In 2023, we built, rebuilt or upgraded approximately 3,200 miles of T&D lines, while also increasing the number of premises we serve by 73,000."", ""In West Texas alone, we built, rebuilt or upgraded over 650 miles of T&D lines and eight new switching and substations. The Texas grid performed very well through record demand peaks over the last 12 months. Oncor's reliability performance as measured by our non-storm SAIDI score improved by approximately 7% in 2023 compared to the previous year. Finally, in 2023, we set company records for active transmission interconnection requests and new transmission interconnection requests in the queue. Active generation and retail interconnection requests increased 25% year-over-year. New interconnection requests increased 19% year-over-year. Please turn to the next slide. These interconnection requests are driven by the dynamic economic growth that we continue to see in Texas."", ""The Texas Miracle continues and is demonstrated by the continued strong growth both in population and diverse commercial and industrial businesses moving to the state. Oncor serves some of the country's fastest growing metro areas, including 4 of the 15 fastest growing cities. From a sheer scale perspective, Texas GDP is second only to California and continues to grow at a robust pace, growing at approximately 8% during the third quarter, faster than the nation as a whole for the fifth quarter in a row. Texas continues to see electric vehicle penetration as well. Over a recent 12 month period, the DFW Metroplex had the largest increase in EV registrations out of any major metro area in Texas with 63% growth. Please turn to the next slide. Oncor has also seen significant growth in commercial and industrial customers, representing electric loads that are larger than traditional commercial projects."", 'Data center development continues to be robust across our service territory, including new sites that have the potential to support hyperscale computing and generative artificial intelligence services. These projects represent the potential for thousands of megawatts of new electric load, often hundreds of megawatts for just one project. Similarly, electrification of the oil and gas industry in West Texas continues at an impressive pace. Our Permian Basin reliability plan reliability plan update published by ERCOT earlier this month projects that within 15 years, the total demand in West Texas could increase fourfold from its current 6.5 gigawatts to 26 gigawatts. This growth is expected to support oil and gas production as well as general electrification.', ""Oncor will be at the forefront and expanding its system to meet the requirements of these customers. Finally, as the population continues to expand both organically and from relocations, we still expect total premise growth to continue at approximately 2% annually. Each of these developments creates new opportunities to expand the Oncor Energy System. We are positioning ourselves to meet these demands through hiring, supply chain procurement and system planning, and looking forward to continuing to serve our customers in the ERCOT market. Please turn to the next slide. On Sempra's Q3 call, we discussed this growth and announced our intention to increase our capital plan. We are pleased to announce that Oncor's 5-year capital plan for 2024 through 2028 is projected to be $24.2 billion, which is a 26% increase over our previous 5-year capital plan of $19.2 billion."", ""The vast majority of this capital plan is to serve customer growth, although the maintenance needs of our system continue to grow steadily as well. This plan does not include the amount of capital expenditures that we expect to request in the upcoming SRP filing that I mentioned earlier. We expect to file that plan in the first half of this year and the proposed spend will be subject to PUCT review and approval. With today's updated plan, we anticipate Oncor's rate base to grow at an annual average rate of 11% from 2023 to 2028. While historically, our earnings growth rate fell below our rate base growth due to regulatory lag. The addition of enhanced recovery mechanisms arising from the legislative session should move our long-term earnings growth rate closer to our rate base growth rate."", ""Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call to Justin to update you on Sempra Infrastructure."", ""Justin Bird : Thanks, Allen. We're also excited about the opportunities in Texas. Sempra Infrastructure is advancing the approximately $13 billion Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project in Texas. This investment along with Oncor's capital plan certainly makes Sempra among the largest investors in the state. At Sempra Infrastructure, we're advancing construction on 5 projects, all of which are on time and on budget and our strategy differentiates us from others in the space. We have a dual coast LNG export strategy, a robust energy network portfolio, and power transmission infrastructure to move more renewable power across the border. All with the goal of delivering cleaner molecules and cleaner electrons to our customers and partners."", ""We've achieved several noteworthy milestones in 2023 declaring positive FID on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was a major success and we secured all required project level debt and equity contributions. Financially, we executed well relative to 2022's strong results and our ability to maintain momentum through 2023 is another indication of our sustainable business model. Sempra Infrastructure's 2023 adjusted earnings were $764 million I'd also like to specifically call out the progress at ECA LNG Phase 1 as it approaches its summer 2025 COD. We are excited to bring one of the first North American Pacific Coast export projects to market. At Cameron LNG Phase 1, we've now exceeded 700 cargoes since production began in May of 2019 and we couldn't be more pleased with the high quality operations from this critical infrastructure asset."", ""On the development growth pipeline, our priorities remain focused on advancing commercial discussions for offtake volume and equity ownership at Port Arthur Phase 2 and assessing Cameron LNG Phase 2's EPC opportunities. At Cameron LNG Phase 2, we've been working with Bechtel on value engineering and at this stage we feel it's best to continue those efforts while evaluating other potential EPC contractors. We're continuing to work closely with Bechtel on Port Arthur Phase 1 and potentially Phase 2, but we and the Cameron partners want to take some additional time to help ensure a cost effective build plan and conduct additional value engineering and analysis to improve the overall value of the project to our customers. At Port Arthur LNG Phase 2, we received FERC approval in September and earlier this month FERC staff issued an environmental assessment finding no adverse impact as a result of the Port Arthur, Louisiana Connector Pipelines amendment."", ""I also want to mention that we continue to make significant progress toward an FID on Cimarron Wind. Recall, this is a 300 megawatt wind project located near our existing ESJ1 and ESJ2 wind projects that will directly interconnect with the California market. Finally, I wanted to highlight a hydrogen hub project we are participating in called High Velocity that is expected to receive $1.2 billion from DOE funding to pursue development. We are also actively engaged with a group of Japanese utilities on a collaboration to produce the natural gas using renewable hydrogen and CO2 as inputs. Projects like these demonstrate Sempra Infrastructure's innovative and entrepreneurial culture as we seek opportunities to provide cleaner and more secure energy for customers."", 'Please turn to the next slide. Turning to macro trends impacting Sempra Infrastructure, global energy demand continues to increase. On sustainability, Sempra infrastructure plays a critical role in providing cleaner alternative solutions to heavier carbon fuels like coal and oil. Natural gas and particularly LNG can effectively replace less sustainable energy sources today. In fact, industry sources estimate that global LNG demand in particular will grow approximately 50% by 2045. There is an additional tailwind associated with emerging market growth as their share of global GDP increases relative to advancing economies. This drives overall energy consumption because developing economies tend to be more energy intensive as they modernize and improve quality of life.', ""Sempra Infrastructure also develops renewables and associated infrastructure that provide cleaner sources of energy and contribute to a broader decarbonization efforts in North America. The final macro driver is the need for energy security. Energy dense, reliable and affordable energy is a key ingredient to building advanced economies. The key question is where that incremental energy production will be sourced. Recently, the DOE announced a pause on granting non FDA LNG export permits to reevaluate the impact granting these permits would have on domestic energy costs and to consider whether climate factors impact the public interest. LNG's climate role is important, which is why even before the regulatory development, we started work on several initiatives designed to minimize our environmental impact and help reduce emissions across our portfolio."", ""One example being the conversion of E drives at Cameron LNG Phase 2. We're also developing carbon capture and sequestration infrastructure associated with our LNG projects. Long-term, we are confident in the commercial, economic and environmental value of our export facilities and we'll continue to work hard on behalf of our customers and investors to advance these projects. With that said, this permitting pause only applies to projects that haven't yet received their non-FDA export permit such as Port Arthur Phase 2. This pause does not impact on any of our assets in operation or under construction. As a reminder, Cameron train 4 has a non FDA export permit and the DOE stated in hearings earlier this month that the pause would not impact in service date extension requests for projects with existing permits."", ""Per Sempra's planning convention, development projects such as Port Arthur Phase 2 and Cameron Phase 2 have not reached FID and are not included in our capital plan or guidance. So, any potential delay would not impact our current earnings growth visibility or our existing capital plan. We can't speculate on the ultimate outcome of this policy, but we'd like to reiterate the compelling environmental value proposition that natural gas and LNG provide. The United States has decreased carbon emissions 17% below 2005 levels despite increasing GDP by more than double in that time. A major reason for that progress is natural gas replacing coal and energy production. We believe a lasting policy of limiting LNG exports would unfortunately hurt the global climate interests, because prospective buyers could be forced to rely on more carbon intensive fuels including coal and fuel oil."", 'We remain as enthusiastic as ever about the merits of our LNG projects as well as our ability to appropriately navigate the regulatory landscape to advance each one. Further, we are optimistic that normal permitting conditions will resume after all relevant variables have been carefully evaluated by the administration. Please turn to the next slide. On this slide, we highlight some key projects under construction in the Pacific and Gulf Coast. These projects strengthen our competitive advantage as a strategically located supplier to both Asia and Europe. The beauty of greenfield development is that it unlocks highly compelling brownfield expansion opportunities. We have begun procurement and engineering activities at Port Arthur, Louisiana pipeline, a pipeline connecting Port Arthur LNG to feed gas in Gillis.', ""We've also begun procurement and engineering at Louisiana Storage, a salt dome natural gas storage facility. These assets will contribute to the larger Port Arthur Energy Hub and demonstrate Sempra Infrastructure's expertise in developing comprehensive energy projects. Meanwhile, construction across the Sempra Infrastructure platforms continues to progress well. At Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, the next milestone will be to commence structural steel. At ECA LNG Phase 1, we are targeting 90% completion of structural steel and at the GRO expansion, we have initiated construction and are targeting completion of the construction of the Mexicali segment later this year. To reiterate, Sempra Infrastructure is playing a key role in securing energy needs and contributing to decarbonization efforts for customers around the globe."", 'Please turn to the next slide. Looking further out, we are developing an enviable portfolio of growth projects and this slide showcases some of our more significant pursuits. For a full list of development assets, please refer to the appendix. I would also note that a number of these projects are brownfield investment opportunities made possible by our initial greenfield investments at Cameron and Port Arthur. Please turn to the next slide. To conclude, we have $4.4 billion of capital deployment opportunities anchored on providing our long-term customers with cleaner and secure energy. And as a reminder, this number only includes projects which have reached a positive FID. Major 2024 investment allocations are slotted for the Port Arthur Energy Hub as Phase 1 construction progresses, ECA LNG Phase 1 as we close in on COD, the GRO pipeline expansion project and the Louisiana storage development.', 'Now, please turn to the next slide and let me turn it over to Karen who will take us through the financial update.', ""Karen Sedgwick : Thank you, Justin. I'm excited to share our year end results and give you more details on our financial plan. Earlier today, Sempra reported Q4 2023 GAAP earnings of $737 million or $1.16 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $438 million or $0.69 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2023 earnings were $719 million or $1.13 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings of $743 million or $1.17 per share. Full year 2023 GAAP earnings were $3.030 billion or $4.79 per share. This compares to 2022 GAAP earnings of $2.94 billion to or $3.31 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2023 earnings were $2,920 million or $4.61 per share. This compares to our previous full year 2022 adjusted earnings of $2,915 million or $4.61 per share."", ""This year's results demonstrate the combined strength of our three growth platforms and sets us up for improved growth in 2024. Please turn to the next slide. Now I will summarize the variance of full year 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period for last year. At Sempra California, we had $69 million of higher net interest expense, partially offset by net tax benefits, offset by $51 million of higher electric transmission and CPUC based operating margin and $52 million of higher regulatory interest income and regulatory awards. At Sempra Texas, we had $2 million of higher equity earnings attributable to increased invested capital, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses. I'd note that earnings in 2022 and 2023 were impacted by the lack of capital trackers that can't be filed during a rate case."", ""At Sempra Infrastructure, we had $85 million of higher earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, $10 million of higher taxes, partially offset by lower interest expense given increased capitalized interest, offset by $49 million of higher transportation tariffs, higher asset supply optimization, partially offset by lower equity earnings from Cameron LNG. For Port Arthur, while our ownership stake is approximately 20%, we consolidate the project for accounting purposes, thus capitalizing interest based on the projects in progress construction. As construction advances, you're seeing the impact of higher capitalized interest versus previous years. Ultimately, these capitalized costs will be amortized back as higher depreciation after the plant moves into commercial operations."", ""At Sempra Parent, there were $15 million of higher investment gains, partially offset by higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefits. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to new investments, as Jeff noted earlier, we're announcing a company record $48 billion capital plan with over 90% of the planned investment allocated to our regulated utilities. This represents an impressive 20% increase over the previous plan and will ultimately serve as a foundation for our company's growth over the coming years. About $24.1 billion or roughly half of the capital plan is marked for investment at Sempra California's 2 utilities, which together have a weighted average ROE of approximately 10.5%. At Sempra Texas, $19.5 billion includes our proportionate share of Oncor's planned CapEx, where recent legislative development should help Oncor reduce regulatory lag and improve its ability to help lessen the gap between the authorized and actual rates of return."", ""The remaining $4.4 billion are primarily associated with Sempra Infrastructure's LNG projects under construction and their associated infrastructure. Please turn to the next slide. With this record capital plan, I would like to illustrate some of the key sources and uses. As you know, Sempra raised equity in November 2023 to support our future investment needs and mitigate the financing risks associated with the capital plan. As a result, we are in a strong financial position and anticipate a reliable internal operating cash flows and regulatory authorized debt will provide the vast majority of our financing needs. We are a growing business while maintaining balance sheet strength, all with the goal of delivering attractive total shareholder returns over the long-term."", ""Along those lines, Sempra will continue to target a 50% to 60% dividend payout ratio, providing plenty of reinvestment flexibility. Please turn to the next slide. Moving to the utilities, our strong earnings trajectory is underpinned by long-term rate base growth. California and Texas rate base is expected to grow with 7% and 11% respectively from 2023 to 2028. Our rate base is split approximately evenly between California and Texas, where we benefit from constructive regulatory jurisdictions and strong macroeconomic growth. On a combined basis, we anticipate just over 9% annual growth through 2028. And this gives us added confidence in achieving our projected 6% to 8% long-term EPS growth rate. Please turn to the next slide. Given the strength of our 2023 results, we've narrowed our 2024 earnings guidance estimates and are now projecting EPS guidance for the year ranging from $4.60 to $4.90."", ""Also, we're announcing 2025 earnings per share guidance with a range of $4.90 to $5.25. This equates to a projected EPS midpoint that's about 7% higher than 2024 guidance. Now, let's break down a few of the assumptions embedded in these figures. At Sempra, California, this already includes the cost of capital trigger. As for the GRC, we're assuming outcomes that are in the range of historical rate case decisions and continue to work constructively with the CPUC and interveners through the proceeding to achieve an outcome that allows us to continue to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable energy for our customers. Turning to Texas, we said in the prior call, the guidance took into effect Oncor's second DCRF. Subject to PUCT approval, the system resiliency plan will apply to 2025 through 2027."", ""And due to timing differences between filing and construction of projects, we'd expect minimal financial impact in 2025. At Sempra Infrastructure, there are a few things to highlight. 2022 and 2023 benefited from an attractive commodity price environment and in 2023 received the cumulative benefit of new tariffs on select Mexico pipelines. Due to the conservative nature of our project development process, we secured rights on the gas pipeline connecting ICA well in advance of COD. This allowed us to better optimize results during this period, but we would expect this impact to moderate as we go forward, particularly with a lower forward curve for natural gas. And now with the magnitude of large projects currently under construction, we have better visibility to certain non-capitalized costs that have now been added to our 2024 plan."", ""And we have ECA LNG Phase 1 expected to come online in the summer of 2025, with full year operations expected in 2026. And finally, regarding the share count, the main driver of the increase is our recent equity offering. As we've discussed, the green shoe of just over 2 million shares settled immediately in November of 2023. Over the course of this year, we're assuming weighted average diluted shares will increase by 4 million which reflects the dividend reinvestment program, equity based plans and the drawdown of our forward settlement, which we now assume will occur in the second half of 2024. Thus 2025 reflects those shares outstanding for the entire year, increasing our share count to approximately 654 million shares. Please turn to the next slide."", ""In addition to our new 5-year plan, we've added this slide in an effort to be more responsive to input from our many investors. Here, it shows the various categories of investments that we're tracking or developing that fall outside of our current plan. It totals over $10 billion and many of these opportunities could form part of our future capital campaign. Please turn to the next slide. You've heard this from our other executives today, but it is important to note that we're excited by the investment opportunities in front of us. We are owners and operators of top tier T&D utility platforms located in North America's largest economies. Moreover, our utilities benefit from constructive regulation that supports significant investment and help ensure safe, reliable, resilient and increasingly sustainable energy for our customers."", ""Over time, our key priorities remain largely the same. We will invest in our high quality T&D infrastructure to improve customer service, maintain a prudent balance sheet and provide compelling returns to shareholders. A record $48 billion capital plan focused on our regulated utilities will be the primary foundation for increasing rate base, growth in earnings power and gives us confidence in achieving our projected long term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. We thank you for joining us as we continue to build North America's premier energy infrastructure company and we're as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to continue delivering attractive risk adjusted returns. I've had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last month, and I'll be out on the road with the IR team in March and hope to connect with those of you I haven't had a chance to meet yet."", ""With that, I'd now like to open the call for some of your questions."", 'Operator: Thank you.

By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.', ""During the five years of share price growth, General Electric moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the General Electric share price has gained 45% in three years. In the same period, EPS is up 14% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 13% average annual increase in the share price (over three years, again). So you could reasonably conclude that investor sentiment towards the stock has remained pretty steady, over time. Arguably the share price is reflecting the earnings per share."", 'The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', 'We know that General Electric has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think General Electric will grow revenue in the future.', ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return.

It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of General Electric, it has a TSR of 179% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""We're pleased to report that General Electric shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 85% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 23% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand General Electric better, we need to consider many other factors.

If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with Most Car Accidents per Capita.', 'According to the World Health Organization’s Road Traffic Injuries Report of 2023, 1.19 million people lose their lives every year due to road accidents. Moreover, these accidents are a leading cause of death among young adults between the ages of 5 and 29 years old. Apart from the loss of lives, though, road accidents also bring about heavy monetary loss — they cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP). Both these losses are undoubtedly huge, but the individuals who suffer in car accidents unfortunately get to experience the worst of it.', ""The WHO report further highlights that between 20 and 50 million people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many resulting in long-term disabilities, and also deliver an expensive financial blow to the victims in the form of medical treatments and car repair bills, which are especially more drastic when the person doesn't have insurance (See: 15 Largest Auto Insurance Companies In The US). According to another report published in 2023 by the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA), in 2019 alone, motor vehicle crashes cost Americans about $340 billion, and damaged 23 million vehicles."", 'Despite the implementation of strict traffic laws, the use of advanced technology, and intricate crash avoidance systems in place, the rate of global car accidents has not seen a decline in recent years.

Other times, however, car crashes are resulted from the act of breaking the law i.e. speeding, drunk driving, distracted driving, speeding, lack of car maintenance, and driving while being under a drug or drink influence.\xa0', 'There are also times when unfavorable weather conditions make it more difficult to see the road clearly and end up causing crashes. A similar accident happened in 1991 on the M4 motorway in Berkshire, Lambourn when excessive fog took over the highway, making it difficult for the drivers to see. Resultantly, a total of 51 cars collided with each other, leaving 10 people dead and around 25 injured.', 'Therefore, whether you are driving on a highway with a speed of 70 mph or in a residential or school district at 25 mph, car accidents can commonly occur and inflict car damage costs or other expenses that may deplete your savings significantly. That’s why, insurance is highly encouraged for all vehicle owners.\xa0', 'According to Bankrate, in 2024, the average annual cost of full coverage car insurance is $2,545, while minimum coverage costs $741 per year. While the car insurance industry is coming back to normalcy after the post-pandemic period, the severe weather conditions and surge in car thefts have made it difficult for private insurance providers to sustain in the industry without raising the prices. According to Insurance Business America, private auto insurers will raise their premiums by an average of 12.6% in 2024.\xa0', 'The key players in the car insurance industry include Progressive Corp (NYSE: PGR), Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE: BRK.B), and Allstate Corp (NYSE: ALL). Entering 2024, Progressive Corp (NYSE: PGR) plans to integrate artificial intelligence into its insurance system which will greatly improve its profitability by enhancing the underwriting and claims management processes and reducing costs. The vice president of Progressive Corp (NYSE: PGR) says, “The insurance industry as a whole tends to be a technology laggard.”', 'Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE: BRK.B) through its subsidiary company, GEICO, offers private car insurance plans. Geico has partnered with Tractable’s AI software for several automating uses such as providing accurate estimates to insurers. In 2024, Berkshire’s (NYSE: BRK.B) subsidiary, Geico, aims to offer some of the most affordable car insurance plans in the US.', ""Just like GEICO, Allstate Corp (NYSE: ALL) has also attempted to move towards digitalization by integrating its first-ever cloud-native technology.

You can skip our detailed analysis of ESG investing and its prospects, and go directly to read 5 Best ESG Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\xa0', 'The concept of ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, was initially introduced in a 2004 United Nations report titled ""Who Cares Wins."" The term was coined with the intention of offering recommendations to the financial sector on how to effectively incorporate environmental, social, and governance factors into investment decisions, recognizing their potential to significantly influence the value of investments.', ""Climate change remains a top priority for the majority of countries, investors, and international organizations. With the approach of 2050 and the increasing emphasis on globally agreed 'net-zero' commitments, addressing climate issues will become even more crucial. This agenda item is expected to gain significance, not only driven by public markets but also by the private sector. The significant focus on addressing climate issues has led to a notable increase in ESG-focused investments in recent times. According to a widely cited survey conducted by Morgan Stanley, over half of individual investors, approximately 54%, intend to boost their sustainable investments in 2024. Additionally, the survey indicated that more than three-quarters of individuals, around 77%, express interest in sustainable investing. The report provided the following observation regarding the trend in ESG investments over the years:"", '“Even investors who know or assume that their sustainable investments underperformed their traditional investments in 2022 report growing interest in sustainable investing. This suggests that sustainability-focused investors tend to be more focused on long-term investment horizons and may not be deeply concerned by short-term fluctuations.”', ""However, investors lacked confidence in their ESG-focused investments in 2023, withdrawing a total of $5 billion from these funds in the fourth quarter, which contributed to a yearly outflow of $13 billion. This decline was attributed to poor performance, ongoing political scrutiny in the US, and challenges faced by an iShares fund, according to a report by Morningstar. While the outflows may seem concerning at the moment, they don't necessarily paint a grim picture of ESG investing overall. Despite these outflows and the fact that sustainable equity funds often trailed behind conventional peers in terms of returns for 2023, market appreciation helped bolster sustainable fund assets by the end of the year. The total assets in sustainable funds reached $323 billion by the close of 2023. This figure reflects a decrease of nearly 12% from the peak recorded at the end of 2021, but it marks an increase of 18% from the recent low point observed in the third quarter of 2022."", ""One prime example illustrating unwavering confidence in ESG investing can be seen through BlackRock's steadfast commitment to sustainable investment practices. Despite facing criticism from Republican circles, experiencing relatively modest returns, and observing a decline in client interest within the US, BlackRock Inc. has been discreetly expanding its influence in ESG investing. Data from Morningstar Direct reveals that BlackRock's assets under management linked to ESG surged by 53% from the beginning of 2022 to the end of the previous year. In comparison, the broader ESG fund market experienced only an 8% growth during the same period. Currently, BlackRock manages approximately $320 billion in ESG funds, surpassing any other investment firm in Europe, the US, or globally."", 'Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Visa Inc.

We expanded our service penetration by launching cross-selling capabilities for our Regulated Waste and Compliance Services and Secure Information Destruction sales team members in the U.S. We also expanded Secure Information Destruction partnerships with large health care group purchasing organizations, which we expect will accelerate our ability to cross-sell and better penetrate the markets we serve. With regards to improving customer implementation velocity, we improved the speed to revenue by cutting in half the amount of time it takes to close a deal and begin servicing and providing value to our complex hospital customers sooner. Throughout 2023, we strengthened our customer partnerships by conducting customer-focused workshops throughout North America. These sessions generated excitement for our enhanced compliance services and award-winning container solutions. Our most recent customer loyalty scores reflect the high level of value our customers receive from our services. Additionally, in support of our U.S. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services ERP deployment in September, the commercial organization was focused on supporting our customers through the system transition. In the second quarter of last year, we achieved our goal of reducing our debt leverage below 3x and have continued to maintain our debt leverage target. We have come a long way since 2019, having improved our leverage over 1.5x and reducing our debt by over $1.5 billion. Portfolio optimization has been a major contributor to streamlining the company and our debt reduction since 2019 as we have completed 19 divestitures and exited 10 countries. In 2023 alone, we divested 8 businesses and exited 6 countries. This helps simplify our business and will allow us to better focus our efforts on driving operational and financial performance in our core services in key markets. Turning to operational efficiency, modernization and innovation. In 2023, we completed over 20 infrastructure upgrades, including installing 5 new autoclaves, 6 new conveyance systems, 2 new shredders and an upgraded wastewater treatment plant at one of our North America incinerator facilities. In the fourth quarter, we successfully expanded an Ohio facility to handle future medical waste growth. Since 2019, we have introduced improvements to more than half of our waste processing and treatment facilities in North America, including installing more than 25 new autoclaves, 6 new boilers and refurbishing more than 20 additional autoclaves and boilers. We have also reduced the average age of our North America fleet to less than 4 years since 2020 as we've continued to focus on modernizing our powered and non-powered units. Our engineering and operations teams have been focused on the construction of our newest incinerator facility in McCarran, Nevada. In November, we successfully installed foundational equipment including the incinerators and boilers. We remain on track to complete the construction phase of the project in the first half of 2024. After construction is complete, we anticipate moving into the testing phase, which includes regulatory review. Once testing is successfully completed, we expect to ramp up the processing of waste with a target to achieve full production in mid-2025. Leveraging our transformed foundation as a springboard, we are positioned for growth and excited to introduce our next generation of key business priorities. These are: one, commercial and service excellence; two, operational excellence, three, digital implementation; and four, strategic capital allocation. I will turn it over to Cory to share his thoughts on our commercial and service excellence key business priority, and then I'll talk further about our other key priorities."", 'Stephen Cory White', ""Thank you, Cindy. Our commercial and service excellence key business priority is focused on driving profitable revenue growth, delivering a differentiated value proposition and creating a seamless customer experience. This includes enhancing sales, service and product excellence to win, retain and grow strong customer relationships. Through our sales excellence initiatives, we continue to focus on our market to quote capabilities, including quality of revenue, digital marketing, e-commerce and contract management. Utilizing the ERP, we expect to further enhance sales excellence by gaining greater insights into sales opportunities, driving pricing intelligence, expanding market presence and enhancing sales productivity. Service excellence is focused on delivering a seamless service experience through all phases of our customer life cycle which includes: one, making it easier for customers to manage their accounts through improved digital touch points with our enhanced online customer portal, including real-time waste tracking, trending benchmarking and sustainability reporting, accessing compliance training, requesting new services, making service changes and visibility to invoices; two, enhancing our customer experience by leveraging ERP-enabled tools to solve issues on first contact; and three, utilizing modern routing and tracking technology in field operations to ensure on-time waste collection and container management. This initiative is expected to strengthen customer relationships and further enhance our value proposition. Finally, product excellence focuses on developing and launching enhanced solutions that deepen our customer partnerships, support our customers' safety and sustainability goals and promote further adoption of existing products and product innovation. We continue to commercialize innovative solutions and products that drive additional revenue opportunities while fulfilling our purpose to protect the health and well-being of health care organizations, commercial businesses, and communities we serve. I'll now turn the call back to Cindy to provide an overview of the remaining 3 key business priorities."", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Thank you, Cory. Turning to operational excellence. This second key business priority is focused on driving margin expansion and cash flow improvement by leveraging the following: a skilled and dedicated workforce focused on safety, service, savings and sustainability, modern technologies, new and updated equipment and infrastructure and a modernized fleet. In 2024, we expect workforce management in our retained businesses to drive approximately $40 million to $45 million in savings. This reflects an approximate 6% year-over-year structural reduction in our workforce. Of the $40 million to $45 million savings, approximately $8 million in savings is expected to come from the reduction in force we announced on our third quarter call. This reduction took place in October and resulted in approximately $3 million of severance. Over $20 million in additional savings is expected to come from the targeted reduction in force that is occurring in the first quarter of 2024 with an estimated $5 million to $7 million in severance that we anticipate incurring in the first quarter. The balance of the cost savings is expected to come from continued careful hiring and attrition that began in 2023. On our new digital implementation priority, we are beginning to strategically explore our next generation of capabilities using the foundation of our modern ERP system. We anticipate that digital, data and AI capabilities will help us to further deliver commercial and service excellence and efficiencies across our network and shared services. The fourth and final of our next-generation key business priorities is strategic capital allocation, which has the following foundational elements: a targeted debt leverage ratio between 2.5 and 3x, investments in the business to maintain and modernize our infrastructure to drive growth and efficiencies, portfolio optimization including accretive tuck-in acquisitions using a disciplined acquisition and integration playbook and consideration of the potential for share repurchases. Consistent with this strategic capital allocation priority, in January, we successfully completed the acquisition of a Southeastern U.S. regulated medical waste company. In 2024, this business is expected to generate approximately $4 million in revenue. We expect to integrate this acquisition into our new ERP technology platform in the second half of 2024. We are proud of the transformation journey we have been on and we are excited about the next generation of priorities we have outlined. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls. I'll now turn the call over to Janet to review our financial results."", 'Janet H. Zelenka', ""Thank you, Cindy. I will start by summarizing our fourth quarter results. As noted on Slide 5, revenues in the fourth quarter were $652 million compared to $670.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, excluding the impact of divestitures of $28.6 million and favorable foreign exchange rates of $5 million, organic revenues increased $5.2 million. Organic revenues in Regulated Waste and Compliance Services grew $13.2 million while Secure Information Destruction organic revenues declined $8 million. Secure Information Destruction was impacted by lower commodity index revenues due to lower recycling revenues and lower fuel and environmental surcharges of $18 million, partially offset by higher service revenues of $10 million. As noted on Slide 6, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services revenues were $439.9 million compared to $449.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and divestitures, organic revenues for Regulated Waste and Compliance Services increased 3.1%. North America Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenues grew $10.1 million or 2.8%, mainly driven by our 3 pricing levers which include pricing in existing contracts, new customer pricing and surcharges and fees. International Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenues grew $3.1 million or 5.1% in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by pricing. Secure Information Destruction revenues were $212.1 million compared to $221.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange rates, Organic revenues for Secure Information Destruction declined 3.6%, mainly due to lower commodity index revenues reflecting more than a $100 reduction in sorted office paper pricing per ton year-over-year and lower fuel and environmental surcharges. In North America, Secure Information Destruction organic revenues decreased $5.9 million or 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Recycling paper revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 contributed approximately 5.9% of the decline or $11.5 million due to lower sorted office paper pricing and lower tonnage. Service revenues contributed approximately 2.9% of growth or $5.6 million due to pricing, partially offset by lower fuel and environmental surcharges. Approximately 50% of the lower sorted office paper recycling revenue was offset by a recycling recovery surcharge, which is reflected in service revenue. As a reminder, on the third quarter call, we discussed that some national customers were reducing their store footprint, which led to a contraction in their related service steps. This contraction continued at a slower pace in the fourth quarter. In International, Secure Information Destruction organic revenues decreased $2.1 million or 8.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, mainly due to lower recycling revenues and fuel and environmental surcharges. Income from operations in the fourth quarter was $37.1 million compared to $59.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The $22 million decrease was mainly due to the following: a gain on a divestiture in 2022 of $15.6 million, lower Secure Information Destruction commodity index revenue margin flow-through of $10.2 million, higher bad debt expense of $8.1 million mainly due to a lower fourth quarter of 2022 bad debt expense level as a result of improved North America Secure Information Destruction collections and higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense of $7.1 million in 2023. These items were partially offset by margin flow-through of $18.9 million, including cost savings from productivity initiatives. Net income was $14.9 million or $0.16 diluted earnings per share compared to $31.8 million or $0.35 diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The difference was mainly related to lower income from operations of $22 million. Cash flow from operations for the year ending December 31, 2023 was $243.3 million compared to $200.2 million for 2022. As shown on Slide 8, the year-over-year increase of $43.1 million was mainly driven by lower FCPA settlement payments of $72.8 million and lower annual incentive compensation payments of $22.3 million, which were partially offset by accounts receivables net of deferred revenues of $68.5 million. Adjusted income from operations was $84.5 million or 13% as a percentage of revenues compared to $90.6 million or 13.5% as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted income from operations decreased 50 basis points, mainly driven by lower Secure Information Destruction commodity index revenue margin flow-through of 160 basis points, higher bad debt expense of 120 basis points and higher incentive and stock-based compensation of 110 basis points. These were partially offset by margin flow-through of 340 basis points, including cost savings from productivity initiatives and margin expansion through portfolio optimization. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.54 compared to $0.60 in the fourth quarter 2022. As illustrated on the bridge on Slide 9, the $0.06 year-over-year decrease was driven by $0.09 from lower Secure Information Destruction commodity index revenue flow-through, $0.07 from higher bad debt expense and $0.06 from higher incentive compensation. These were partially offset by $0.16 of margin flow-through. Capital expenditures for 2023 were $131.3 million compared to $132.2 million for 2022. Free cash flow for 2023 was $112 million compared to $68 million in 2022. As noted on Slide 8, the year-over-year increase of $44 million was mainly driven by higher operating cash of $43.1 million. After considering 2023 adjusted litigation and severance payments, free cash flow excluding these 2 items was $138.5 million, which is approximately $30 million below our 2023 free cash flow guidance range of $170 million to $190 million. This difference is mainly driven by the timing of U.S. Regulated Waste Customer billings due to the ERP implementation as we are holding and reworking some invoices for our largest customers to ensure accuracy. Turning to the full year 2022 results on Slide 14. Revenues were $2.66 billion compared to $2.7 billion in 2022. Excluding the impact of divestitures of $101.6 million and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $0.1 million, organic revenues increased $56.3 million or 2.2%. When 2023 and 2022 results are normalized to exclude the revenues from divested businesses, revenues were approximately $2.63 billion in 2023 compared to $2.57 billion in 2022. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenue growth was $71.9 million, while Secure Information Destruction organic revenues declined $15.6 million. Secure Information Destruction was impacted by lower commodity index revenues of almost $50 million due to lower recycling revenues and lower fuel and environmental surcharges. When considering Secure Information Destruction's organic revenue growth over a 2-year compounded annual growth rate, it grew 6.6% since 2021. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $77.3 million compared to $153.7 million in 2022. The $76.4 million decline was mainly due to change in divestiture net losses of $79 million, higher incentive compensation and timing of stock-based compensation of $22.7 million, lower Secure Information Destruction and commodity index revenues and the corresponding margin flow-through impact of $18.5 million and fleet cost of $10.5 million. These were partially offset by margin flow-through of $41.2 million, mainly from cost savings from productivity initiatives and lower bad debt expense of $7.1 million. Net loss for 2023 was $21.4 million or $0.23 diluted loss per share compared with net income of $56 million or $0.61 diluted earnings per share in 2022. The difference was mainly related to lower income from operations of $76.4 million, as previously discussed. Adjusted EBITDA was $420 million in 2023 compared to $432.2 million in 2022. The $12.2 million decline was mainly due to inflationary and supply chain costs of $25.5 million, higher incentive compensation and timing of stock-based compensation of $22.7 million and lower Secure Information Destruction commodity index revenues and the corresponding margin flow-through impact of $18.5 million. These were partially offset by margin flow-through of $51.1 million and lower bad debt expense of $7.1 million. In 2023, divested businesses generated a nominal amount of adjusted EBITDA. When 2023 results are normalized to exclude results from divested businesses, 2023 adjusted EBITDA would still have been approximately $420 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.89 in 2023 compared to $2.04 in 2022. As illustrated on the bridge on Slide 17, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates and divestitures of $0.04, the remaining $0.11 year-over-year decrease was driven by: $0.19 from higher incentive and stock-based compensation, $0.15 from lower Secure Information Destruction commodity index revenues, $0.09 from higher fleet costs and $0.08 mainly from higher taxes. These were partially offset by $0.34 from margin flow-through and $0.06 from lower bad debt expense. I will now turn to our 2024 guidance, which includes forward-looking statements as contemplated in our safe harbor statement as referenced at the opening of this call. Our guidance is shown on Slide 18 and is as follows. One, we expect to grow organic revenues 3% to 5% on a normalized revenue base of $2.63 billion; two, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.50. This assumes approximately a 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA on a 2023 normalized adjusted EBITDA base of $420 million. As shown on Slide 19, this margin growth rate anticipates revenue margin flow-through of approximately 4%, cost of revenue efficiencies and cost reductions of approximately 9% mainly driven by our workforce management actions and operational initiatives, and selling, general and administrative efficiencies and cost reductions of approximately 4% mainly driven by our workforce management actions. These are expected to be partially offset by commodity impacts of 3%, mainly associated with sorted office paper pricing, which assumes a range of $125 to $140 a ton and fuel estimates for 2024 from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Compared to last year, we anticipate that the first half of 2024 will have a more challenging paper pricing year-over-year variance as the sorted office paper price per ton was above $200 on average for the first quarter of 2023 and above $185 on average for the second quarter of 2023 and the second half of 2023 pricing return to the historical average range. Three, as noted on Slide 20, we expect to generate free cash flow of $210 million to $265 million excluding additional interest payments due to redeeming the $600 million bond with proceeds from the revolver and severance payments. Excluding these 2 cash outlays, we anticipate an adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate of 44% to 55% in 2024. Severance payments in 2024 are expected to be approximately $5 million to $7 million. The additional in-year interest cash payments from redeeming the bond and higher interest rates are expected to be $14 million to $19 million. When we redeem the bond, interest payments will shift from being semiannual bond payments to monthly revolver interest cash payments. And four, we expect capital expenditures of $140 million to $160 million. Regarding the timing of free cash flow generation through 2024, we anticipate the first quarter to be a use of cash as it includes our annual incentive compensation payouts, the semiannual debt interest payments and the timing of accounts receivable collections. Because of the heavier utilization of cash in the first quarter, we anticipate that our first quarter debt leverage ratio will be above 3x and then is anticipated to return to our debt leverage ratio range of 2.5 to 3x in 2024. I will now turn the call back to Cindy."", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Thank you, Janet. Our focus on ESG and sustainability is an ongoing pursuit, which we actively incorporate into our everyday practices and into our strategic business plans. In early February, we received our grade from CDP, and I'm excited to share that we achieved a B score, our highest rating since we began filing with the CDP 3 years ago. This follows on the heels of 4 recent awards on diversity and sustainability that recognize the continued maturation of our organization. With that, I'd like to thank our customers, team members, the communities we serve and our shareholders for their continued trust in having Stericycle protect what matters. Operator, please open the line for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Sean Dodge from RBC Capital Markets.', 'Sean Wilfred Dodge', ""Congratulations on the strong finish to the year. On the guidance and specifically on the bridge, I think super helpful that you all provided this, so thank you for that. On the cost of revenue efficiencies, it looks like half of that driven by workforce reductions and half from operational strategic initiatives. Cindy, you mentioned a lot of things in your prepared remarks. Can you give us a couple of examples of what the operational strategic initiatives are, what's new for 2024 and what are those expected to contribute?"", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes. I think -- Sean, thanks for the question. And we did try to be quite thorough with the bridges. We know there's always a lot of moving parts and wanted to make sure that we make it as easy as we can. Yes, you're right. As we're moving into 2024, we're now driving into the efficiencies. We're pivoting from the transformation phase and I think really moving into now delivering on plans, executing the plans, doing the things we need to do. If you'll recall, now [Shred] had been on from an operational perspective. They've been on the ERP platform for quite some time. And right now, we really are gaining efficiencies there. We've got a workforce that's familiar with the handhelds. We've got dispatchers that are very familiar with dispatching, routing and really making some gains. And what we're going to lean into for 2024 is, you'll recall, we just put the regulated side of the business on the ERP in Q4 of last year. And they're starting to develop a similar rhythm, not quite as advanced but certainly we're still working through some things. But you did catch on that whole rift piece. We took a reduction in force this quarter. And we are going to lean into some of those efficiencies that I just talked about in the second half. The other thing, Sean, is when you talk about the amount of facilities and upgrades and equipment and modernization that we've done just in the work environments in which our people work, as you lean into those things, whether it's conveyance, whether it's resetting a building in terms of making workflow better. When you do those things, along with standardizing some of the containers and a lot of the things that we do, those are the productivity initiatives that we're leaning into. So some are new, some are a continuation. And I think just that along with the improved routing capabilities and some of the things we have, those are the things that are really driving our ability to improve margins. Thanks for that question."", 'Sean Wilfred Dodge', ""Okay. Great. And then just quickly on SID. Janet, you said that the service stop rationalization had slowed in the fourth quarter. Are you seeing any evidence as it continued into this year? Has it stabilized? Is it continuing to taper? And it's still only the national accounts where you're seeing that? Or have you seen that in other parts of your base as well."", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes. Sean, I'll start. Thanks for that question. If, Janet, there's else you'd like to add. I think we're very proud of our Shred side of the business. To have faced the level -- the headwind of a difference of $100 a ton pretty much for the year, certainly for the second half of the year, to have faced that and still continued to have the opportunity, to service our customers, there still is demand for the service. I think what speaks volumes for us is, we like to talk about the fact that if you look at the actual growth of the business, over the last 2 years, so for -- since 2021 and '22 in comparison with '23, we've seen a 6.6% year-over-year over that 2-year comparison growth. And for me, that speaks that there's still demand for the business. And you are correct, we are seeing -- it is the national footprint. It is that retail space. Any time you take those big customers and they reduce -- I'll just throw out an average number, this isn't a specific. But if you go from having 8,000 stores that get serviced either every week or every other week and now you reduce them to 6,000 and you take a few of those types of retail spaces that see that contraction. We feel that. We've not lost customers. As a matter of fact, we continue to grow with customers. But we feel it in terms of both the stop, the service fee as well as the paper that wasn't generated. So we're still very, very positive about the shred side of the business, especially with their efficiencies, how they're getting better, how they're adapting and learning from data. So they play a very integral role in our continued growth. Thanks for that question."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Dave Manthey for Baird.', 'David John Manthey', 'My first question is regarding the next-generation key business priorities as you outlined them, Cindy, they seem to all pretty much be centered around technology tools. Are there additional investments required for plug-ins to your ERP? Or does that functionality already exist within your instance of 4HANA?', 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes. No, that's a great question, Dave. We're very excited about those. I think many of them do. It's now time to lean into the effort and energy and the money, quite frankly, that we invested in with our current ERP platform. So for us, I think if you were -- as we look further into the digital implementation for us, right now, I think commercial and service excellence and then the operational excellence, that's us taking us, diving into what we have and getting better at what we do. When you look at the digital implementation, and we talk about where else can we deploy more digital kind of streamlined engagement with customers or some of these other things or we look at AI, those are the things that we're developing and looking at, but -- but to your point, we don't see major technology investment required for harnessing any of that."", 'David John Manthey', ""That's great to hear. Second, on the paper side, could you give us a figure for the tonnage in 2023 and what is your expectation for '24? And as we're thinking about the typical formula there which is -- I think it used to be you experienced about 40% of the downside below $192 per ton. Is that the same? Or have you moved the needle on that formula?"", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes. I'll start with that one. The table is pretty much the same. Right now -- the good news is right now, we're seeing paper in its 15-year average. It's anywhere from 140 to 160. It bounces in between there. As you know, you follow I think, probably as closely, if not more so, than most, Dave, you and your team. So yes, it's now rationalized and I think gotten far more stable in terms of predictability. So we are looking at that as kind of being a nonentity. But that -- the sliding scale that we do have, that is the protection for it. And yes, you are correct. The scale has stayed the same with $192 being the top. And around that, I think the bottom -- the floor goes to about $85, somewhere around in there. I'm not quite sure I'd have to check on that -- on the floor for you. And then Janet, I think, has got the stats for the tons of paper year-over-year."", 'Janet H. Zelenka', ""Yes. And we also have that in the 10-K, Dave, and thanks for being on the call today. After divestitures normalized, the tons were 453,000 versus 500,000 the year before for tons of sorted office paper. So we did see some decline not unanticipated, given the contraction of stops, which reflects the paper that we talked about in the nationals and some -- and that -- I also wanted to point out in our guidance range for SOP price, we assume between $125 to $140 a ton. That seems to be a good run rate for what the business is doing today. And it's in the sweet spot of that recycling recovery surcharge range where it recovers about 2/3 of any fluctuation that we see. And the bottom end of the range of index is around $77."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Michael A. Hoffman from Stifel.', 'Michael Edward Hoffman', ""So on the opportunity to drive operating leverage at the gross margin line. You've talked a lot about this convergence of manual processes as a result of ERP. So what you have shared with us, this initial $40 million to $45 million, what percentage of that opportunity are we capturing?"", 'Janet H. Zelenka', ""So of the $40 million to $45 million, that is -- the increase remain -- over $20 million of that is due to the targeted workforce reduction. So I would say about 50% of it is on things that we've already taken in action. The rest of the margin improvement that we're referring to there is on efficiencies, route optimizations, so all kinds of things we can leverage on a modernized fleet, modernized facilities and modernized system."", 'Michael Edward Hoffman', ""So I did a bad job of asking the question. There's a certain amount of headcount that's been tied to doing manual processes. Are you done with this risk? Or is there more to come? That's what I was trying to get at. What percent of..."", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Sorry, Michael. Yes, we had -- if you recall, we had a smaller risk in October of last year, and then we are in the process of executing one right now in first quarter of this year. It will be -- it will end up being about a 6% year-over-year reduction in headcount, and that's where we believe right now, we are positioned to be able to drive growth and really focus on top line and equally, if not more important, really driving bottom line opportunities. So that's -- I don't -- we don't foresee anything else."", 'Janet H. Zelenka', ""Yes. And we also leveraged attrition and careful hiring and we'll continue to do that through the year. But in terms of an action, as Cindy said, we don't anticipate any more this year."", 'Michael Edward Hoffman', ""Right. Okay. And then -- if I take the outlook, the combination of the -- long-term outlook, the 3 to 5 on the top line, 13% to 17% in EBITDA and the 50% or better in free cash, so how do I sort of put together this year's guidance into a couple of things? One, is the top line mostly about price? Or are we starting to get new customer adds, stop adds? Is the operating leverage that you're talking about, is it -- how much can we expect incrementally from here from asset utilization, that sort of -- that was talked about under the digital and the revised plan. And then the cash conversion is coming under the plan. So what has to happen to adjust the cash conversion? Trying to pack four questions into one, so I do two."", 'Janet H. Zelenka', ""Yes. No, that's fine, Michael. So I'm going to ask for those. Listen, I'm going to go to Slide 18, 19 and 20 on this. So the 3% to 5% is balanced. We expect volume and price to be part of our -- and that's an organic revenue growth only. So it does not include the opportunity for tuck-in acquisitions nor the tuck-in acquisition we mentioned on the call. So that's pure organic. In terms of the -- so where we're getting the drivers of the about 14% adjusted EBITDA growth rate that underlines our adjusted EPS range, it is what we talked about, largely within our control with a significant amount already executed as we drive efficiencies, leveraging all the things I mentioned. The free cash flow, if you go to the Slide 20 and you look at that, our adjusted free cash flow range is around 40% to 50% on a pure basis. However, when we were looking at the long-term range we had not contemplated the severance payments, and I wouldn't normally do that. And we also have a shift in our interest rate payments due to the maturation of the bond and going to 12-month payments in the year versus the normal payments of the bonds. That is a onetime effect. So we thought we'd mention that as well. And then when you take those out, you're in about the 50% range on your free cash flow when you're looking at the normal operations of the business for 2024. I think I answered all your questions, Michael. If I didn't, go ahead and say one more thing and then we'll go to the next person."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.', 'Scott Andrew Schneeberger', ""I'd like to start just following up on pricing. It sounds like, Janet, it's kind of the long-term guidance for revenue organically is half price, half volume. How is the pricing environment particularly in the regulated waste segment? Are you -- because you have longer-term contracts, they roll off. You've been through an inflationary environment, I would -- and still kind of on the tail end, it seems how is your ability to be getting pricing now? I guess, this is kind of for both of you."", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes. I think -- Scott, great question. Good to hear from you. We have our ability to take price in the market according to market conditions. I think we've been doing a great job with that. We have been -- I think some of the commodity headwinds and a few other things may mask some of the gains that we've been making. But I think we're well positioned in the market. And right now feedback from customers, let's say, on the regulated side, with the new portal, with the changes and the abilities and kind of the visibility we've given them, there is an even greater level of, if you will, stickiness to some of the opportunities and the things that we can now do based on the fact that we're on a platform. So I think all of those things lend themselves to our ability to continue to lead in the marketplace to bring value to our customers and to continue to come up with solutions that they need, if you will."", 'Scott Andrew Schneeberger', ""And just a quick follow-up on that and then one more. But on the pricing, on the -- with customers, how would you frame the competitive environment? Going back 8, 10 years ago, there was a bit of a shift where Stericycle was adversely impacted by some enhanced competitive dynamics. How would you kind of categorize the industry now? You just mentioned in that last response you're a leader, as we would expect. But just curious how it looks competitively out there."", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes. I think the one thing that stayed the same in both of our businesses is that the competition is still regional. So we've got some regional players that are a little stronger than others on both the Shred and the regulated waste side. And I think there are some where we've got -- some regions where we've got a stronger presence, a bigger footprint, where we can leverage ourselves a little better than others. And I think all of those things now in our understanding of that are really -- it's really leading us now towards this potential tuck-in acquisition opportunity, where we can see more in depth in the areas where competition may or may not be there to whatever level and what's our ability to grow and to serve. So I think it's probably the same in terms of overall it's still a regional competition and it is different in every region. But I think we're well positioned to take advantage and to drive further growth, both organically as well as with some very laser, very, very specific, very deliberate tuck-in opportunities."", 'Scott Andrew Schneeberger', ""And that's a great segue for my final question. It sounds like you have a propensity to start doing tuck-ins a little bit more actively. I kind of want you to compare and contrast that by what remains with regard to divestitures, which presumably what remains would still be international. And obviously, you have the ERP implementation internationally this year. So tying that all together to make the question, would we see net acquisition or divestiture, contribution or headwind in the guide this year? And how much is there -- left there on the divestiture and on international?"", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes, Scott, I think the good news there is just in 2022 alone, we divested of -- we had 8 divestitures and got out of 6 countries. So I would probably describe the ability of folks to continue to follow the story with the puts and takes, I can tell you, it won't be anything like that. We don't have 8 countries left to divest of. So I think overall, what we're looking at, we still have portfolio optimization as a priority. We're looking to be opportunistic and see -- we've got great insights into the markets in which we operate. The divestitures we've made, quite frankly, 19 in the last 4, 5 years have allowed us to really focus on driving operational and financial performance in the core markets and in our core businesses. So I think I can guarantee it certainly isn't anything like the bouncing ball you've seen over the last few years as right now we're really -- we have the ability to buckle down, get very focused and execute to the plans that we have. But it still remains a priority simply because we constantly look to be opportunistic."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from line Tobey Sommer from Truist Securities.', ""Tobey O'Brien Sommer"", 'A follow-up on a similar theme here. How do the new systems change your view of acquisitions? And how do you view the market opportunity for Stericycle to sort of be a consolidator again? And maybe in the context of that, if you could share key parameters you look for in acquisitions, including valuation.', 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes. I think a couple of those. Anytime you have a modern technology platform like we have, that is a game changer in terms of our ability to integrate, integrate quicker, our ability to engage with the customer base -- the new customer base that would be brought on in a seamless manner. Technology is really the key is whether you're talking about top line opportunity or bottom line as you have greater visibilities and insights into all the productivity key elements. So for us, our ability to get that platform in has really -- it's a catalyst for us to be able to do more things. But you have to combine that, Tobey. The other thing that afforded us this opportunity is the discipline that we've had financially and really just being very focused on being able to, number one, improve the balance sheet; but then number two, continue to operate in a manner that generates cash so that we do have an opportunity to take advantage of whatever the market presents. So I think for us, what are we looking for? Well, as I mentioned in one of the prior answers, we've got -- we're going to be very strategic. We -- over the course of the last few years, as we've put in much more structure and discipline and standardization, we're very focused. We've got a strong playbook in terms of what are the market conditions that would make us be opportunistic, what does that do to our overall network, what's the culture of the company, a myriad of things that we look at that right now make us have the ability to do tuck-ins. However, we would not be anything like the tuck-in engagement that maybe some folks might be familiar with Stericycle from years past."", ""Tobey O'Brien Sommer"", ""How should we think about CapEx and free cash conversion over sort of more medium to long term relative to your '24 guidance? And I'm not asking for long-term guidance, but to the extent there are knowable puts and takes in the future that you could shine a light on, that would be helpful."", 'Janet H. Zelenka', ""Yes. So we do actually have long-term outlook of our free cash flow conversion rates. We use the 50% to 60% that we still have out there. And in terms of the capital needs of the business, this is a business that needs to be maintained, and we see opportunity to invest in ourselves to grow. So I don't anticipate a much different profile of capital in the ranges that we've given in the past in the future. We will not get to that free cash flow conversion rate by reducing capital."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of John Mazzoni from Wells Fargo.', 'John Peter Bonner Mazzoni', ""Maybe a quick one on Nevada and McCarran. It's been very helpful for that color in terms of the kind of completion of construction in the first half of the year and then regulatory review and testing with the ramp of full production in mid-'25. Could you just give us a sense of kind of some of the puts and takes there, especially around the kind of milestones and what we should be looking for? And maybe once it's fully ramped, should we expect that you would use the full permit? Or any other commentary around the volumes once ramped would be helpful."", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes. I think more to come, I think we will -- as we move through this, we said the whole project was going to be in 4 phases. So we've talked about the construction, which we're in. We've got testing. We've got kind of ramping up and then full production. So for us, we see it as a steady journey. The good news for us at this point, John, is the fact that in spite of maybe potential supply chain issues or any types of problems with materials, we remain on track getting both of those boilers -- or getting the incinerator stacks and the boilers in, in terms of their positions. We're getting close to being able to start the testing part of it. For us, that's a big deal. That's a milestone. We've been on budget and we're very pleased with the effort that's going on there. So in terms of -- as we move March throughout these quarters and we hit these different things, whether it's testing or it's testing and ramping up and passing regulations and those types of things, I think, we'll give a regular cadence in terms of where we are so that folks can get a better understanding, including us, as to when we'd be running some volume through there. So I think more to come there in terms of that. Right now, I think we've given pretty much what we can to this point."", 'John Peter Bonner Mazzoni', 'Great color. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on cross-sell, it was helpful in terms of the acceleration of the velocity to close. But has there been any other initial proof points you can share? And maybe just how are the conversations going with customers?', 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes. No, I think the velocity, cross-selling and the engagement with customers has been great. I've got -- I'll let Cory White, our Chief Commercial Officer, jump in on that as I don't know anybody who's been more engaged with customers this past year than Cory. So any updates, Cory, in terms of where the customers are?"", 'Stephen Cory White', ""Yes, great question. Very early days. I think at this point, more to come on this as I think you're aware that the new ERP system has provided us the opportunity for the first time to actually see the full spectrum of customers that are utilizing our service on both sides of the house and the overlap. So very early days in our evaluation and our opportunity to drive growth in that area. But we're excited about what the data is providing from a go-to-market perspective. So more to come on that. But a lot of lessons learned, very early days in our utilization of the ERP system. So just one added tool in our quiver."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research Associates.', 'Kevin Mark Steinke', 'So I apologize if I missed this, but you gave the impact of commodities on the adjusted EBITDA growth in 2024. What are you assuming for the commodity impact on organic revenue growth in 2024? And is that baked into the 3% to 5% organic revenue growth target?', 'Janet H. Zelenka', ""Yes. So it's baked into the 3% to 5% organic revenue. That's basically a flow-through from the top line down to the commodity impact, driven mostly by the fuel surcharges and the sorted office paper price."", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Yes. And one thing I think that is important for -- we talked last quarter about when -- are we still facing headwinds in terms of that comparative with the RISI rate. And just to let everybody know, Q1 of 2023 from a RISI perspective, paper was still up over $200. It was about $225. Q2 of 2023, paper was around $186. So with it right now being around $140, $145. Q1 is where we see a good bit of comparison headwind. But certainly, we see an opportunity to continue to grow and as customers still show demand. And then Q2 is, let's say, a $30 to $40 headwind, a little different. But we're confident that when we get to the second half of the year where, if you remember, Q3 of '23, paper was averaged around $146, Q4 is around $139 or $140, much more normal averages for the past 15 years. That's where we believe we're head-to-head pretty much even in terms of where paper is. So we see the commodity more as a first half, if you will, Q1 a little bit more than Q2 type of situation."", 'Kevin Mark Steinke', ""Okay. I mean, the reason I asked that is that presumably, if we put commodities on an apples-to-apples basis year-over-year, then you'd be targeting organic revenue growth faster than 3% to 5%. So I was just trying to get sense of the magnitude..."", 'Cindy J. Miller', ""Absolutely. You bring up a great point. We're very proud of the efforts from top line and bottom line that people fought through to really try to mitigate as much as they can, something that was as much a headwind that we faced as we did. And I think it just shows the resilience and the dedication of the team here at Stericycle and I think the continued commitment with the relationship with the customers that we have as they continue to depend on us. So very, very pleased with that in spite of the fact that numbers didn't necessarily look fantastic in terms of that top line. But facing that $50 million, that was a big deal for the group."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Cindy for any closing remarks."", 'Cindy J. Miller', 'Thank you, Victor. So to everyone listening on this call, we appreciate your interest in Stericycle and your shared excitement for our future. Thank you all very much.', 'Operator', ""Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.""]"

Retirees expect to pay minimum taxes, especially taxes on income, property, and sales taxes. Does the average retiree appear to be increasingly fixated on cost of living concerns? As we mentioned earlier in our article about the best cities to retire for 2024, only a modest 3.2% increase was recorded in the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) in 2024 so far, considering the recent trends. However, retirees are worried about the fact that their living expenses have soared against the standardized measure. Almost 64% of baby boomers have reported facing moderate to high levels of stress concerning their retirement savings, as per a study by T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW). With the beginning of 2024, the “Peak 65 zone” has also begun, a period that will witness record levels of US citizens reaching the age of 65. Moreover, social security funds are also set to decline by 2034 and the retirement scenario is set to face major shifts and challenges.', 'The majority of 66% of Peak 65ers are bothered about not having saved enough for retirement, as per a study by the Alliance for Lifetime Income (ALI). Whereas, 79% are more worried about the cost of healthcare. The healthcare cost is projected to increase nearly 7% in 2024, according to the forecasts of the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Health Plans (IFEBP). Healthcare costs will rise due to many factors including chronic health conditions, catastrophic health claims, and increasing prescription drug prices, among many reasons.\xa0', 'The US Federal government generates most of its revenue from personal income taxes followed by social security and medicare taxes and corporate income taxes. In the fiscal year 2024 so far, the US government has generated a total revenue of $1.58 trillion with personal income taxes accounting for 50.96% and corporate income taxes adding 10.70% to the total revenue. Social Security and Medicare taxes accounted for 33.68% of the total revenue in the fiscal year 2024.', 'For the tax year 2024, the minimum income tax rate is 10% while the maximum income tax rate is 37%, similar to tax year 2023.

Please go ahead."", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Thank you, and good morning.

For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.16 for the fourth quarter of 2023. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.13 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023."", 'Marc D. Miller', 'Our acute hospitals continue to experience strong demand for their services in the fourth quarter, with adjusted admissions increasing 5.6% year-over-year. Overall surgical volumes were solid as well, increasing 4% year-over-year. Net revenue per adjusted admission, which has lagged for much of the year, increased by 3.7% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, as acuity trends and pressure from payers have started to stabilize. Meanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the quarter, which declined from a peak of $153 million in the first quarter of 2022, was $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, similar to what it was in the third quarter. For the full year 2023, our strong acute care revenues were largely offset by elevated expenses, especially physician subsidies which resulted in flattish margins for the full year. During the fourth quarter, same-facility revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 7.2%, driven primarily by a 6.1% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. The patient day growth in the quarter was greater at our acute behavioral hospitals versus our lower acuity residential treatment centers, which tended to drive up the revenue per day to relatively robust levels consistent with our year-to-date experience. Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, we continue to see a negative impact of Medicaid redeterminations in certain states on behavioral health volumes, although it appears that impact has also begun to stabilize. With 8% revenue growth, same-facility EBITDA for our behavioral hospitals has increased approximately 9% for the full year of 2023 compared to 2022.', 'Steve G. Filton', 'We also note that in the fourth quarter, we recorded approximately $18 million in connection with the recently approved Mississippi Hospital Access Program covering the 6-month period of July through December of 2023. Our cash generated from operating activities was $452 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $297 million during the same quarter in 2022 and $1.268 billion during the full year of 2023 as compared to $996 million during 2022. We spent $743 million on capital expenditures during 2023, which was consistent with our original forecast for the year. For the full year of 2023, we acquired $525 million of our own shares pursuant to our repurchase program. Since January 1, 2019, we have repurchased more than 26 million shares, representing almost 30% of our shares outstanding as of that date. As of December 31, 2023, we had $701 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.', 'Marc D. Miller', ""The core operating assumptions underlying our 2024 operating results forecast which was provided in last night's release, largely reflect the historical pre-COVID trends in their respective businesses. We anticipate that volumes in our acute segment will moderate from the elevated 2023 levels, but conversely, acuity and pricing in our acute business will increase, and for the full year, both metrics will resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic, despite the continuing shift of services from inpatient to outpatient settings and pressure from payers to restrain reimbursement increases in a variety of ways.We expect continued improvement in premium pay labor trends and general cost trends that will remain largely stable in 2024. Specifically, physician expenses, which were a major headwind in 2023 are expected to grow by the overall inflation rate in 2024. As noted in our press release, our 2024 operating results forecast includes an additional $149 million (sic) [$140 million] of Nevada supplemental revenues, which were approved by CMS in late December and disclosed by us in an 8-K filed in early January. We believe demand for our behavioral services remains robust, and our same-store adjusted patient day growth in 2024 is forecasted to exceed the 2.1% growth we experienced in 2023. A significant driver of behavioral volume upside is due to our success in filling vacant positions, but we acknowledge that specialty workforce shortages in certain markets, continue to be an obstacle to even more volume growth. In both our business segments, we were pleased that measures of patient satisfaction and quality of care increased in 2023, and we are focusing on continued improvement of these metrics in 2024. We are pleased to answer questions at this time."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho.', 'Ann Kathleen Hynes', ""I just want to ask you about the 2 midnight rule. I know that throughout the year, you had a lot of denials for these short-stay inpatient days. Does that get better in Q4? And do you actually think one of the large national managed care plans are saying they actually think hospitals might have built early and to start benefit in Q4? Do you actually think that happened? Did you receive actually a benefit in Q4 from kind of early billings of this regulatory change that's starting in January 1, 2024? And also, can you tell me what your guidance includes for any potential benefit for this change for this and also for Medicaid redeterminations considering there's like a big growth in the health exchange market? And are you assuming any kind of positive payer mix shift benefit in guidance?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. So as Marc commented in his prepared remarks, I think what the -- what we saw in Q4 was improved revenue per admission -- projected admission in the acute business, which I think we attribute to a combination of increasing acuity but also at least stabilizing pressure from payers.Again, I think we saw for much of 2024 -- excuse me, for 2023 and payers being more aggressive as their medical loss ratios were rising, et cetera, in a variety of ways, including denials and patient status changes, which would include recasting patients from inpatient observation, et cetera. I don't think we changed our billing practices during the quarter. But I think all you're seeing is effectively, I think we're starting to anniversary some of that more aggressive behavior of the payers in the fourth quarter. As far as sort of how we guided, again, I think, as Marc said in his remarks, I think we're assuming that in the acute segment, that volumes moderated a little bit in 2024 and that acuity pricing improves. So we returned to kind of what I would consider to be a more historically normative model of mid-single-digit growth in acute care maybe 5%, 6% growth, split pretty evenly between price and volume. And I think what that really means is we're being a little conservative about volumes, which have sort of been running higher than that, but we're being a little bit more aggressive about pricing, which has been running less than that. But it's not like we have included in our guidance a specific impact from sort of how payers will use the 2 midnight rule differently going forward, et cetera. We believe there may be an incremental opportunity there but I don't think we necessarily feel it's material until we really see the behavior on the part of the payers change."", 'Ann Kathleen Hynes', 'Okay. Great. And just one follow-up. You talked about in your prepared remarks that the labor shortages are still impacting volume. Is this in both segments? Or is it mainly behavioral? And maybe how much do you think your volumes being held back because of labor?', 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. I mean, so as we've said, I think, throughout the last several years, it's been a very tight labor market, and I think it's affected the 2 businesses differently. On the acute side, we've generally been able to fill all of our necessary positions. But obviously, often at a higher cost using temporary label and traveling nurses, et cetera. Although as we indicated in our prepared remarks, those numbers have declined significantly.On the acute side -- excuse me, on the behavioral side, in contrast, in a number of cases, we're simply unable to fill our positions over the last several years, and it has curtailed our volume growth. Again, I think our basic guidance for next year is mid-single-digit growth probably in the behavioral segment, that means 6%, 7%, 8%, again, split pretty evenly between price and volume. In the behavioral segment, I think that means we're being a little bit more conservative about price which has been running hot the last couple of years and a little bit more aggressive about volume, which has been relatively soft this year. I think Marc said our patient day growth in 2023 was 2.1%.So our guidance assumes something greater than that. But we acknowledge that in some markets, in some hospitals, there are positions that we still have difficulty filling, I don't know that we can say precisely, but we do think that we could run higher volumes if, in fact, we could fill all of our positions, but we know that's not a realistic outlook at the moment, at least."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.', 'Justin Lake', ""I wanted to ask you first about the 2024 guide. The -- specifically -- the Nevada ends up at the high end of the range you gave before, obviously, a great tailwind. Ex that, it looks like EBITDA growth at the midpoint in the 4% range, Steve. Just trying to understand, I think the -- we're probably able -- we're splitting hairs a little bit, maybe expected 1%, 2% better than ex-Nevada. Just curious if there were any kind of one-timers in '23 where it's not really apples-to-apples that you want to point out? Or anything within the guidance, for instance, Marc mentioned a tough comp on inpatient. Like maybe you could tell us what you think the EBITDA by business is going to grow? And any thoughts on why that's maybe 1% or 2% shorter than kind of typical?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. So first of all, Justin, I mean I think that there is a series of arguments that we made that excluding the $150 million increase in Nevada or quite frankly, excluding any of our Medicaid supplemental payments is really an appropriate way to look at the business because I think what we would argue quite strenuously, is that one of the reasons -- one of the significant reasons that our margins and earnings have lagged over the last several years is that Medicaid reimbursement, in particular, has not kicked up with elevated costs, whether that's the labor costs across both businesses or the physician subsidy expense that Marc referenced in the acute business in his remarks. So in our minds, the [amount of] increase specifically but these Medicaid supplemental programs in general are simply bringing us back to adequate rates that at least partially compensate us for some of these increased expenses. So in my mind, ignoring them, as we think about our growth year-to-year, is not necessarily the correct way of doing it. But I'll try and answer your question the way you asked it. What I would say is I do believe that after a couple of difficult years and difficult operating environments and elevated costs, again, in labor, physician costs, just general inflation sort of across the board, we've been a little bit cautious about our ability to expand margins. I would say that if we're able to achieve the revenue targets that we've set in our guidance, we'd be hopeful that we could do better than the margins that are embedded in guidance. But as we faced over the last several years, some of these expense increases have been a bit unpredictable, physician subsidies in 2023 are a perfect example. So I think we've been prudently cautious about how we look at the profitability growth in both businesses."", 'Justin Lake', ""That's helpful. And then, Steve, as you mentioned on DPP, and I don't disagree that it's lumpy, but it should be part of the business. That said, it's gone to a place I never imagined to go in these supplemental payments. And I'm just curious, like you guys actually put out a great table in the 10-K, where you actually showed us the estimated number for 2024. And I'm just sitting here and look at it over time, Steve. I think in 2019, it was $225 million of net benefit or 13% of EBITDA. Now it's an $809 million benefit or 41% of your EBITDA guidance in 2024. And I'm just curious, like do you think this continues -- like do you see any state that could be the next Nevada? Or do you see the potential that this starts to moderate at some point or kind of stabilize because it's obviously been a big part of growth over the last couple of years. Just curious how you think about it going forward."", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. So look, I think you make a good point. I mean, I think if you look, and I appreciate your commenting on our disclosures because I think we've provided probably more expansive disclosures in this area of Medicaid supplemental payments than any of our public peers. But if you go back, however many years you want to track it, it has, as you've suggested, an upward trajectory. And that's not by accident. I mean I think it's an acknowledgment by the states and by CMS that Medicaid reimbursement, again, in specific space, has really been inadequate and has really been inadequate over the last several years in an elevated inflationary environment with significant expense pressures, particularly in labor. And the states are providing these monies not as bonuses for hospital providers. But quite frankly, as necessary supplemental reimbursement to keep them in a position -- to keep the providers in a position to be able to provide absolutely necessary services to a population that otherwise will not receive them. So quite honestly, there are other states that do not have these programs that are talking about adopting them. We don't really disclose them until they get further down the road and sort of our submitted for approval and that sort of thing. But we know that conversations are happening in a number of other states. CMS, to your point, has certainly talked about the impact of the growth in these programs. And as talked about, I think limiting the growth, I don't think they're really talking about cutting back these programs, but they're talking about capping the growth, maybe capping the growth at -- so that Medicaid reimbursement can exceed commercial reimbursement. I don't think we're at risk of that in any of our states or just sort of capping the overall growth rate, et cetera. So I could see that happening where the rate of growth slows, but it strikes me that once these programs are implemented, the safety net hospitals that they are really designed to target become so reliant on them that it would be extremely difficult for the state and/or CMS to stop the programs or curtail them in a terribly material way."", 'Marc D. Miller', ""I think that's the main point that it's going to be hard to go backwards because of these safety net, not-for-profit hospitals that rely on this. And so the crux of your question as to whether or not you can bank on this in the future, we never know. But I think it's going to be hard for them to reverse a lot of this. And in fact, to Steve's point, we're seeing a lot more activity in other states that we had never seen before. So we think it's going to increase."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research.', 'Joshua Richard Raskin', ""Question, just start looking at the longer term, as you sort of think about capital deployment, I'd be interested in your updated views on the relative attractiveness of the behavioral health in the acute care segment and specifically thinking whether you believe either one of those segments has either a different growth or return profile, one more attractive than the other?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. I mean, obviously, anyone who looks at our financials can see that we are in a higher margin in the behavioral business, I think, probably higher returns. But I think we've always viewed our opportunities for capital deployment agnostically in the sense that we want to invest our next dollar of capital wherever we think it's going to earn the highest return. And that's not just about which line of business, but it's about the individual market opportunity. Las Vegas is a great example. We've invested a tremendous amount of capital, hundreds of millions of dollars of capital over the last decade or more in Las Vegas. And I think for the most part, it has earned a significantly sort of outsized return.We are not about to stop investing in that market and protecting our #1 market share position in that market, et cetera. So our capital deployment decisions are, I think, made, as I said, market by market, in terms of the demographics of the market, the competitive environment. And obviously, as I think we commented in our remarks as well, significant amount of capital has been devoted over the last 5 or 6 years to share repurchase because we think that, that's been a compelling return and opportunity for us, and we'll continue to look at that as well."", 'Marc D. Miller', ""I'll just add one thing to what Steve said. We're looking -- and I obviously agree with everything Steve said. But we're looking at more outpatient opportunities now than we probably have done in the past. And so I think more of them are being presented to us. And again, if we think that there are good returns there and then they make sense for increasing our success in our markets, we'll continue to look at those and deploy more capital to outpatient, maybe at a greater percentage than we did historically."", 'Steve G. Filton', 'In both segments.', 'Marc D. Miller', 'In both segments.', 'Joshua Richard Raskin', ""Right. So that makes sense. And so in theory, those are margin accretive. Those are certainly return accretive but margin accretive, I guess, depending on though, if there's more opportunities maybe in the acute care segment in the short term, maybe that's not the case. But I guess my follow-up would be, I'm curious about the current environment for additional supply then. Are you seeing any major capital deployed in your markets by competitors? And I guess, conversely, sort of that Vegas example, what markets do you think are in need of more supply?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. I mean so we, as you know, are opening a new hospital in Las Vegas late in 2024 in West Henderson, that's on the heels of opening Henderson Hospital 5 years ago, if I'm getting my chronology correct. That's been a very significant success. We've continued to expand our presence in South Texas and Riverside County, California, where we have significant market positions. We're building a new hospital in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. And one in the D.C. market, where we had a significant amount of historical success.So -- and then on the behavioral side, we continue to add beds and do joint ventures with nonhospital -- nonprofit hospital partners. So again, I think there are lots of opportunities. I think the challenge for us is to be judicious about where we do that. And to your point, Joshua, I mean, I think our competitors are also investing in markets. I think HCA has invested heavily in Las Vegas as well because it has been a very lucrative return market for both of us. So we see that. It really varies by market. It would be difficult to characterize the sort of capital deployment of our competitors in a broad way. But yes, we certainly see our competitors expanding as well. And again, our whole sort of view is we don't want to chase what our competitors are doing. We want to really take advantage of the strong franchise positions that we have and build on those and need to earn greater returns by investing where we've had success."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.', 'Stephen C. Baxter', ""Two quick ones on the acute business. I guess, good to hear the physician fee expenses that you seem to think the worst of the inflation is behind you there. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on how -- or what level of contracting visibility you have on 2024 in particular? And then just a kind of a step back on the acute business. There's been a lot of focus on portfolio management at a couple of your peer companies, a couple of examples of significant value creation. I was wondering how you think about the size of the acute care business philosophically and whether there could be examples potentially whether you've seen in the increase in inbound interest on the acute side? I would love to just hear kind of how you guys are thinking about that as you contemplate capital across the company."", 'Steve G. Filton', 'Yes. I think that the notion of contracting visibility in terms of the physician subsidy expense is a little bit flawed. The reality is, 18 months ago, if you had asked us and asked, frankly, any acute care hospital in the country, are your hospital-based physician contracts locked in? Do you have rates locked in? The answer would have been, yes. And what we found were because of changes in the operating environment, in particular, the no-surprise billing act, et cetera, that made those businesses far less profitable.The providers in those businesses, the physician groups, the companies that were providing those services simply were unable to do it. And they were coming to hospitals and saying, ""Look, you either have to provide us greater subsidies or we can\'t do this."" There were a number of bankruptcies, et cetera. So what I will say is I believe that over the last 1.5 years, most of our hospital-based physician arrangements have been recast. They\'ve either been renegotiating with the incumbent providers. We\'ve either gone after RFPs and put in new providers or we\'ve employed in some cases, the physicians ourselves. We\'ve done so, I think really beginning late in \'22 and early in \'23 such that the increased cost of doing all that is now largely reflected in our financial statements, and it shouldn\'t increase again dramatically in 2024.But I will say, again, back to the comments that I made in response to a question that Justin asked, I do think that the volatility in that area is one of the reasons why we\'ve been a little more cautious in our overall guidance in 2024 because I think all hospitals would say that was a cost that really surprised us in 2023. We think we have it under control. We think it\'s much more stable going into 2024. But we\'re certainly concerned about that popping again or happening again in some other areas. Answer the acute care development.', 'Marc D. Miller', ""Sure. As to your second question about the portfolio and acute care opportunities, we track very carefully all the companies, familiar with what you're referring to the question of portfolio rationalization for some of those other companies out there, we are most interested in what we can do in our current acute care markets. So if there are opportunities to pick up other hospitals that are within markets that we are already present, we would certainly look to do that. But in addition to that, we are familiar with the whole portfolios of these companies. And if there were opportunities to expand into new markets that we thought made sense, we would do that as well.Like Steve said earlier, we're kind of agnostic as to which side we deploy capital to. But if there are opportunities, we'll certainly pursue them."", 'Steve G. Filton', ""I know your question was not directed at the behavioral business, but I would make the point that we've done quite a bit of portfolio management in the behavioral business over the last 5 or 10 years. If somebody wants to take our 10-K list of properties from 10 years ago, behavioral properties and compare them to today, you can see that they're quite different. We've closed facilities, we've sold facilities, we've merged facilities, where they're underperforming and where we're looking to increase efficiencies. We tend not to disclose that because individual transactions are not material. But there has been a fair amount of portfolio management on the behavioral side. And then again, we're open to that.I think we're ready for the next question."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.', 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', 'Great. Just wondering if you could give us an update on where wage growth is across both the acute and the psych businesses today? And to the extent that labor is still a gating factor on the seg side of things. How do you think about the incremental return of just raising wages a couple of percent to potentially drive more volume back to the facilities?', 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. I would say that wage growth has moderated a little bit from its highs in both segments. I think we're probably in that 4% to 5% range of annual wage inflation. And obviously, we've made is, again, I think we said in our prepared remarks, a fair amount of progress in reducing premium pay, which includes temporary traveling labor and overtime shift differential that sort of thing. And -- I'm sorry, one second..."", 'Marc D. Miller', ""No, the question is, we look quite often as to whether or not it makes sense to raise wages as a way to increase capacity. And we have done that in certain areas. It's not as easy as one might think, but we definitely look at that, and we try to figure out if there are areas where that would make more sense.The other factor for us is we have high occupancy in a lot of these facilities. So we're constantly looking and reviewing ways that we cannot bid for the facilities to increase capacity. And one of the things that Steve talks about the portfolio rationalization that we've done on the behavioral side in the last few years. What that also allows us to do is spend less time on facilities that are not growing and really spend more of our time figuring out how to do programmatic growth, not just beds, but just changing program offerings at certain facilities and changes like that, that we think will have a positive effect. So we're doing a lot of that as well."", 'Steve G. Filton', ""But I would just add, I think, Kevin, what to thunder, you're asking, do we think about the efficacy of paying increased wages to attract that last 1% or 2% of the workforce that would help us increase our volumes. And that's really the why -- when and why we use temporary labor because the challenge is if we hire somebody for that last position or last 2 or 3 positions in the facility, and they're making $5 an hour more than everybody else in the facility. In short order, everybody in the facility will be making that same wage. So that's the consideration we have to use. We certainly acknowledge that we want to fill every position we can, but we understand that there are implications to paying up to do that."", 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""Okay. Great. And then I guess I just want to maybe push back a little bit on the guidance for acute care hospital volume growth kind of just being more pre-pandemic growth rates of 2% or 3%. I guess when I look at your same-store volume growth going back to 2019 and just trying to get forward, I think you're only like about 4% above where you were in 2019, 5 years later, when you would normally be thinking you'd be growing 2% or 3%. So you're still -- in 2019, we might have thought your volumes would be 10% or 15% above those levels. So why is normal growth off of only 4% up like the right number? Shouldn't there be more pent-up demand or normalization in demand within your markets (inaudible) normal growth?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. I mean again, though, and particularly the comparison that you're talking about, Kevin, I think it's wholly inappropriate to exclude the $150 million of Nevada supplemental from a comparison to 2019 because I think what we would say in Nevada is we've had virtually no Medicaid increases for this period of time. And as a result, and we've been questions about this, our margins in Nevada have declined, et cetera. So to then say that we're going to exclude the $150 million from comparing where we were margin-wise to 2019. Again, I think it's a flawed approach.And again, that's not to say we believe that even with the supplemental payments, et cetera, there is still more growth to go in the acute division and more recovery to be had to get closer to those pre-pandemic margins. But I think excluding the supplemental payments from that is a flawed way of looking at it."", 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""Sorry, my question was kind of more around the volumes. It feels like to me like your volume guidance, it feels like your volumes haven't really rebounded to the long-term trend line yet. So I'm still not sure why you're only growing normal, wouldn't you still be trending back to the long-term growth rate in volume? Shouldn't you be growing faster in [2 to 3] for another couple of years?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""I mean our adjusted admissions in 2023 grew by 5%, or I think actually over 6% for the year. Honestly, I think those are historically high level of admission growth, we're projecting that at some point, that starts to moderate."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citi.', 'Jason Paul Cassorla', ""Great. I just wanted to ask on behavioral. You talked in the past around the labor backdrop as the gating factor for bed growth, you've discussed the portfolio rationalization efforts. I guess, occupancy rates are still some 200 to 300 basis points below pre-pandemic levels. With labor improvement, I know you're expecting volume growth to accelerate in '24. Can you just give us a sense on what you're contemplating on the behavioral bed growth side moving forward? And maybe just the opportunities a little bit more around that expansion at current facilities against maybe perhaps the pipeline of JVs or potential M&A for behavioral business as well?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. I mean, so I think we added somewhere around 250 new beds in behavioral this year. We will probably add a like numbers, so maybe a little bit more next year. But I think the comment that Marc made is I think we're seeing, frankly, just as much opportunity on the outpatient side as well. So we are expanding and expanding our existing outpatient services across all lines of services, including addiction treatment, et cetera, and plan to continue to do that as well. I think as Josh Raskin mention you about kind of a higher returning, higher margin business. So that's attracting more of, I think, our investment dollars there."", 'Jason Paul Cassorla', ""Okay. Fair enough. And then just following up on an earlier question a bit. Just curious on what your expectation around payer mix dynamics are for next year? Obviously, redeterminations, exchange growth. And you've talked about this return of low acuity of Medicare volumes in '23. Just any kind of expectation around how that trends into next year or into '24? And then can you remind us what percentage of admissions are uninsured at this point? And if -- just given the backdrop, if you're seeing any indication that those uninsured admissions could be picking up? Just any color there would be great."", 'Steve G. Filton', ""No. We haven't seen a significant change in uninsured admissions, which run in sort of the mid-single digits, 5% to 6% of our overall admissions. I think what -- the big change in dynamic which I think a number of both the providers and payers have talked about in 2023 is that as we've emerged from the pandemic, I think we've seen more of those lower acuity, I think, especially Medicare, lower acuity procedures that patients had deferred or postponed during the pandemic taking place. And again, as our volumes moderate going forward. And they have been moderating, not just for us but all for our peers as well in 2023. I think it goes lower acuity volumes that especially are moderating, which I think would agree is what's driving the increase, let's say, in the fourth quarter in our acuity and pricing dynamic."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.', 'Albert J. William Rice', ""Maybe just to comment on premium pay first. I think you said you started the year at $153 million in the first quarter and you were $67 million as you exited the year. Do you think the $67 million is a good run rate? Is there further opportunity? And putting it all together, how much of a tailwind do you have from reduced premium pay in '24 versus '23?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. So just to clarify, A.J., the $153 million was the first quarter of 2022, not 2023. And -- so yes, that -- obviously, that number has come down considerably. I think we still think that there is -- we ultimately have talked about getting to a premium pay number in the sort of $50 million quarter range. So there's still $50 million or $60 million of opportunity. A lot of that is dependent on what happens to volumes. I think that premium pay has remained a little bit higher than we originally anticipated because acute volumes have been as strong as they've been. But yes, I mean, we certainly have the goal of further reducing premium pay. I'm not sure we're going to get back to the pre-pandemic levels were around about $35 million a quarter, but we should be able to get at least part of the way there."", 'Albert J. William Rice', ""And I don't have the full year number for premium pay, but how much have you just stayed at $67 million, how much of a tailwind would that create '24 versus '23? Do you have that number by any chance?"", 'Steve G. Filton', 'Yes. So I think that would probably -- (inaudible) off the top of my head, A.J. But I think that would probably on its own would be like a $30 million, $40 million improvement. Because I think in the first half of the year, we were running about $85 million a quarter.', 'Albert J. William Rice', ""Okay. And then my follow-up question, just ask a little bit more on Medicaid, both from the supplemental and the redeterminations. On the supplemental, I know we've talked about individual programs. When you put it all together, what you got in '23 versus what you're expecting in '24, how much of a change is -- I guess it could be gross or net after provider tax just trying to understand that. And then you mentioned, I think, in the press release or in the 10-K that Medicaid redeterminations were a headwind for the behavioral business. I'm just wondering if you [plush] that out a little bit more."", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. So I think somebody earlier had suggested, I mean, we gave some pretty robust disclosure at these Medicaid supplemental programs in the 10-K that we filed last night. I'd refer people to that. But we have a table that shows the supplemental increase from '23 to estimated '24, it's about a $200 million increase. Obviously, the $150 million of (inaudible) is the biggest piece of that. But you can see a lot of the detail if you take a look at that schedule. And as far as Medicaid redeterminations, I think what we've said, A.J., is that in the states, which probably is most notably Texas on the acute side, and some other -- Texas and some other Southern states like Louisiana and Arkansas on the behavioral side, it's largely affected the child and adolescent population from our perspective, and that had a relatively minimal effect on the acute business, a bigger effect on the behavioral business. We've seen a softness, I think, in the last 6 months of 2023 in our child and adolescent business in the behavioral business that we attribute to a large extent to these redeterminations. We think we're sort of out of the worst of that. The redetermination for the most part are the disenrollments have taken place, we're already starting to see some of these -- some of this population reenrolled either in Medicaid or alternative programs like CHIP or in commercial exchange program. So I think that we're imagining that the impact of redeterminations in 2024 will be limited."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.', 'Philip Chickering', ""On behavioral, the good thing for '24 guidance, I think half of the revenue guidance is coming from pricing. Pricing for behavioral has been very robust in the last few years. Can you talk about the sustainability of that strong pricing you've seen looking at the exit rate in fourth quarter? How we should think about a step down in '24? And then any color on sort of what you're seeing between the different payer mixes managed care rate increases versus Medicaid and Medicare, that would be great."", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Sure, Peter. So again, I think as we commented, the strong behavioral pricing, I think, has really been driven in 2023 by 2 things. One is actual sort of softness in our residential, and that's where a lot of the child and adolescent business is. And so the higher weighting of acute patient days to residential patient days and that, by definition, sort of increases what we would describe as pricing or revenue per adjusted day. As we emerge from the disenrollment challenge as we emerge from the handful of residential facilities that had particular regulatory challenges, in 2023, I think we'll see residential growth starting to outpace acute growth, and that will have a kind of a muting effect on pricing.The other issue that we have talked about pretty consistently, I think for over the last 12 or 18 months is a pretty aggressive effort on our part to go back to payers, particularly in markets and in facilities where we are already capacity constrained and negotiate higher rates. And that's, I think, particularly managed Medicaid payers who have been giving us, I think, historically, less than adequate increases. We've had a lot of success doing that, but to some degree, we're starting to anniversary that impact. So again, while we are certainly going to continue to strive for the maximum increases we can get from our payers, our general sense of our 2024 budget is that pricing and acuity will decline a little bit on the behavioral side, but be offset by increased volumes."", 'Philip Chickering', 'Okay. Great. And then on acute margin guidance for 2024, it sounds like physician reimbursement is now just slightly over inflation. Full-time labor is normal. Contract labor is a $30 million, $40 million savings guiding to flat margins despite revenues growing 5% to 6%. Are there any known headwinds for 2024 to offset sort of all these tailwinds? Or is this simply just pure conservative at this point?', 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. Again, as I think I tried to frame it before, Pito, I think it is kind of a broad caution and conservatism that we've taken but informed by the pressures of the last couple of years, when we were sitting here in -- a good example is the physician expense. When we were on this exact call a year ago, we were projecting a pretty big increase in physician expense, a $50 million, $60 million increase. It turned out to be twice that. So even when we're aware of issues, et cetera, the last couple of years have created a little bit more volatility than we're accustomed to. So I think we were trying to account for some of that in what I view as a fairly cautious approach to guidance."", 'Philip Chickering', 'So let me ask it differently, ignoring the $30 million, $40 million contract savings and assuming nothing normal labor, et cetera, et cetera, on a 5% to 6% revenue growth, what would be the normal margin expansion coming from that?', 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. So I think that's a hard question to answer, Pito, because it's sort of how you define normal, we're in a high inflationary environment, et cetera. I'll just repeat what I said before. I believe that our view is if we can achieve the revenue target better than in our guidance, we'd be hopeful to bringing out more efficiencies and therefore, higher margin from the business that are currently reflected in the guidance."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners.', 'Benjamin Whitman Mayo', ""First, Steve, I just wanted to point out that you have also considerably exceeded those initial Medicaid supplemental payment disclosures in your 10-K every year, I can recall. So I just wanted to mention that for the record, but my question really on Medicaid is there's been a theme for years now where many states have gotten workaround solutions to the IMD where Medicaid is now covering adults that actually have substance use disorders through 11, 15 waivers. I'm just wondering if there's any evidence that you see that those policy actions are now manifesting into any volume growth for you?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. I mean there are a couple of individual facilities in markets that I think has been affected by IMD waivers. I would say that broadly, it has had probably not a material effect on the segment. But there are specific examples I could point to. But yes, no, I wouldn't say it's broadly a material impact."", 'Benjamin Whitman Mayo', ""Okay. And back to your comments on outpatient now elevating itself as a higher priority. Now that Medicare's reimbursing for IOP and partial hospitalization programs. Just wondering if that opens up obvious opportunities for you if that's what you're referencing when you talk about outpatient for behavioral?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. I mean, really, I think, is the full continuum. We have always had what we call intensive outpatient programs in our behavioral facilities or partial hospitalization programs which are sort of a means of step down from the inpatient facility. But I think what we're focusing now on besides those programs, which we continue to maintain is more sort of pure outpatient, in many cases, not necessarily even affiliated with an existing facility, et cetera, but stand-alone outpatient. And to your point, it's the Medicare Advantage -- it's the Medicare opportunity. But it's also -- again, we're finding the need for behavioral care to be growing across all segments of the population and across all diagnoses, including addiction and others."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Sarah Elizabeth James', ""So earlier, your comments on pricing about being a little bit below the halfway point of the 5% to 6%, I'm assuming that was blended products. Could you speak to what you're seeing on the commercial rate increase side? Because some of your peers are talking about kind of mid-single digits on that and seeing a little bit of traction of being able to work in the physician fees. So I'm wondering what that's looking like for you guys on the acute side?"", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. I think those characterizations are fair. So if we're talking about overall -- an overall pricing assumption in our guidance of 2.5% to 3%, we're probably getting twice that on our commercial business, so 5%, 6%. And in terms of -- specific to that whether we're able to cover increases in (inaudible) that really varies contract by contract, et cetera. But the mid-single-digit commercial increases that you're saying or peers are citing seems to be consistent with the life experience."", 'Sarah Elizabeth James', 'Great. And one more just on what you guys are doing on technology investments on the acute and behavioral side. Are you implementing any sort of virtual bed checks on either of those segments? Or where would you focus your technology investment?', 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. So I would highlight. I mean, we have a lot of technology investment, but I think specifically, in behavioral, and we've talked about this before, we are implementing an electronic medical record in our behavioral facility. That project is already underway. We are experimenting with and testing a number of technological solutions to more efficient per patient rounding in our behavioral facilities where patients will wear something like an Apple Watch kind of device and we're able to track their location and we're able to track when we lay eyes on those patients, et cetera. So that's improving the efficiency of our patient rounding in our behavioral facilities as well."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn it back to Steve Filton for closing remarks."", 'Steve G. Filton', ""Yes. We'd just like to thank everybody for their time this morning and look forward to speaking to everybody in a couple months after the first quarter. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.""]"

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE today."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:', '15% = US$4.0b ÷ US$26b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.15 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""At first glance, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seems to have a decent ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 19% does temper our expectations. Although, we can see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals saw a modest net income growth of 16% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company."", ""Next, on comparing Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 15% over the last few years."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is REGN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether REGN is currently mispriced by the market."", ""Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.
