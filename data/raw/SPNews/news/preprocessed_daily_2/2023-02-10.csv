In addition, many stocks are now seeing their earnings outlooks drift higher.However, one big-time name in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, Kimberly-Clark, has seen its near-term earnings outlook come under pressure as of late, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Kimberly-Clark is principally engaged in manufacturing and marketing a wide range of consumer products worldwide.  KMB operates three business segments: Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, and K-C Professional.Let’s take a closer glance at the company.Share PerformanceKimberly-Clark shares have struggled to find buyers year-to-date, down more than 5% and widely underperforming relative to the S&amp;P 500.Still, over the last year, KMB shares are hanging onto a 1.5% gain, easily beating the S&amp;P 500 in the same period.Buyers have backed off following a big run-up from October 2022 to mid-December 2022.Quarterly PerformanceKMB has primarily posted mixed bottom line results, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in six of its last ten quarters.Still, revenue results have been much better, with Kimberly-Clark exceeding sales expectations in six consecutive quarters.DividendsThe stock does pay a dividend, currently yielding 3.6% annually.In addition, the company has shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, carrying a 4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Bottom LineMixed bottom line results and negative earnings estimate revisions from analysts paint a challenging picture for the company in the near term.Kimberly-Clark is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook over the last several months.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:3 Big Surprises of Q3 Earnings Season So FarImagine this –Once every few months, you’re required to release information detailing your current financial standing. The public can see where you’ve spent money, made money, or even how much you’ve saved.Sounds scary, right?That’s just a different way of describing what earnings season is.So far, this earnings season has turned out better than feared, helping to keep the market afloat following a brutal 2022.And there have been several big surprises, including those from Netflix, Meta Platforms and Uber Technologies.Let’s take a closer look at what each company delivered.Uber Technologies Sets Quarterly Trips RecordUber posted better-than-expected quarterly results, crushing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 240% and reporting earnings of $0.29 per share.Uber generated roughly $8.6 billion in revenue throughout the period, surpassing our consensus estimate marginally and growing nearly 50% year-over-year.There were also other several notable highlights, including –Gross Bookings totaled $30.7 billion, growing an impressive 19% year-over-year and exceeding our consensus estimate by nearly 0.6%. This is illustrated in the chart below.Further, total trips throughout Q4 tallied 2.1 billion, representing a quarterly record and growing nearly 20% year-over-year. In addition, the total beat our consensus estimate by roughly 1.5%.And to top it off, Uber posted adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, growing $579 million from the year-ago quarter.Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO, on the results, “We ended 2022 with our strongest quarter ever, with robust demand and record margins,” He continued, “Our outlook for a Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA step up in Q1 builds on that progress, and sets us up for yet another record year.""Netflix Crushes Subscriber EstimatesNetflix reported mixed top and bottom line results, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by roughly 75%.Quarterly revenue totaled $7.8 billion, modestly ahead of estimates and growing 2% year-over-year.However, the focus point of the entire release remained the company’s Net Subscriber Additions.Results came in well above expectations; Netflix reported Net Subscriber Adds of roughly 7.7 million, handily beating our consensus estimate of 4.5 million by nearly 70%.It represented the company’s third consecutive quarter exceeding our consensus estimate for Net Subscriber Additions, undoubtedly a major positive.The market cheered on the better-than-expected Subscriber Additions, with Netflix shares climbing nearly 9% the following trading session.Meta Platforms Cuts ExpensesThe market was impressed with META’s quarterly report, with the company exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 40%.In addition, quarterly revenue tallied $32.2 billion, again exceeding expectations by roughly 3%.Of course, there were also some key developments, including –The company unveiled a massive $40 billion share buyback program to increase shareholder value.Most importantly, the company revealed some cost-cutting measures. As many are aware, investors were critical of META’s capital expenditures (CapEx), especially during a challenging 2022 business environment.Nonetheless, the company expects full-year 2023 total expenses in a range of $89 billion – $95 billion, down from prior views of $94 billion – $100 billion.Further, META expects CapEx in a range of $30 billion – $33 billion for full-year 2023, again down from prior expectations of $34 billion – $37 billion.Bottom LineEarnings season continues to chug along, with many companies reporting daily.And in the coming weeks, just as many are slated to do the same.Several companies, including Netflix, Meta and Uber, have stolen the show so far, reporting results that had investors celebrating.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Real Estate Companies in the World.The global real estate industry involves the buying, selling, and management of properties such as residential homes, commercial buildings, and industrial spaces. It is a complex and diverse industry that includes a wide range of participants, including real estate agents and brokers, property developers, landlords and property managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and financial institutions. As is true for most other industries, the world of real estate is prone to influence by a number of factors, including economic conditions, demographic trends, government policies, and technological advancements. Following a pandemic-fueled course correction, the global real estate industry faces transformational shifts in how buildings will be used, valued, and transacted in 2023 and beyond. This is evidenced by Deloitte's 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook, which revealed that only 40% of global real estate chief financial officers (CFOs) expected to finish 2022 with higher revenues than last year, and 33% anticipated cuts to expenses, citing sustained high inflation, workforce management, and cyber as the top risks to financial performance.According to a report by GrandViewResearch, the global real estate market size was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030. The market is expected to grow at a healthy pace during the forecast period, owing to the rising population and a desire for personal household space. As of 2021, the commercial real estate space was estimated to be the most important element driving industry expansion. Additionally, in terms of revenue, rental real estate types dominated the market with a share of 52.1% in 2021. This is attributable to rising home prices in developed countries, owing to which there is a rise in the number of renters, favoring the segment growth.Story continuesThe pandemic caused significant changes in consumer demand, which led retailers to modernize their systems to better adapt to these changes. This includes improved analytics and strategies to maintain customer loyalty in response to changing consumer preferences. This holds especially true for Gen Z as it is highly dependent on technology and relies more on the internet and social media to make purchasing and lifestyle decisions. Since Gen Z has experienced technology their entire lives, leasing and marketing campaigns for real estate services should incorporate the use of technology to reach this generation where they are most active, which includes social media, or any other internet source.20 Most Valuable Real Estate Companies in the Worldjason-dent-w3eFhqXjkZE-unsplashOur Methodology We used stock screeners to identify the most valuable real estate companies in the world based on market capitalization as of February 1, 2023.

As part of the application, students must take a series of financial education lessons covering topics including student loans, credit scores and more to be eligible for the twice yearly sweepstakes. A recent study found that the program gives students more confidence and know of their finances. About 32,000 students registered for the second-half 2022 entry period of the scholarship program, completing nearly 100,200 financial education modules.There were four other winners in the second half of 2022 sweepstakes drawing, including first prize winner Hannah Bees, who received $10,000. Bees is a sophomore studying rehab health and kinesiology at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa. Bees plans to become an occupational or physical therapist when she graduates.Story continues""This is a huge relief,"" said Bees, who said the $10,000 will allow her to drop one of the two jobs she's working to help pay her way through school. ""I can use that time to catch up on studying.""The second prize winner, Khady Sow, at Bluegrass Community and Technical College in Lexington, Kentucky, with an expected graduation of Spring 2024, won $4,000. For the first time, an additional category was created for students who attend school where there is a U.S. Bank campus branch location. Bertha Perez-Mendoza, who attends the University of Oregon and expects to graduate in Spring 2025 won $1,500, as did Julie Hanson at Minnesota State Mankato, who expects to graduate in Spring 2026.Coakley found the U.S. Bank Scholarship when researching scholarship opportunities online and was immediately intrigued that it only required completing modules and not writing any essays. ""I dread writing essays - science is my passion for a reason,"" she joked. Bees also found the U.S. Bank Scholarship online and found some of the modules to be ""eye opening"" as she thought through her own finances and ahead to the next stages of her life after graduation.Obtaining her certificate in medical lab sciences will put Coakley in a much stronger position to achieve her lifelong dream of landing a job as a forensic scientist, which melds her love of science with her family's legacy of working in law enforcement.""You're putting pieces together to make a full circle - I love the puzzle-solving and critical thinking aspect of it,"" she said.More information about the next round of scholarships will be available in February at www.usbank.com/scholarship.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/738800/Students-Studying-Forensics-Physical-Therapy-Among-Scholarship-Winners]"

Replacing him will be Newell Brands CFO-turned-President Chris Peterson, who joined the company in 2018 after executive stints at Polo Ralph Lauren and Procter &amp; Gamble.“It has been a distinct honor leading Newell Brands over the last several years and I am inspired by our talented employees who are passionate, resilient and courageous,"" Saligram said in a statement. ""I am confident that they are committed to making Project Phoenix and our new Segment-based operating model a major success.”In January, Saligram unveiled a cost-cutting plan dubbed Project Phoenix that will see a 13% reduction in office positions. Newell owns over 100 brands, selling everything from Sharpie pens to Rubbermaid food containers to Coleman camping gear across three segments.Saligram joined a struggling Newell in July 2019 after leading Ritchie Bros and OfficeMax in the CEO capacity. The company had been hemorrhaging money following an ill-executed $15 billion deal acquisition for Yankee Candle seller Jarden.The company then came under attack by activist Carl Icahn. By March 2018, CEO Michael Polk had stepped down and Peterson served as acting CEO.Saligram moved quickly to streamline Newell's sprawling business while also doubling down on product innovation for the company's most important brands despite the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.Newell Brands CEO Ravi Saligram on Yahoo Finance Live in August 2022.

(WMT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-wmt-trending-stock-140002358.html,1675951202,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest retailer have returned -4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.8% change. The Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, to which Walmart belongs, has lost 4.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.51 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.09 points to a change of -5.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.54 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walmart is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Walmart, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $159.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $608.11 billion and $626.47 billion estimates indicate +6.2% and +3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $152.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.7%. EPS of $1.50 for the same period compares with $1.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.67%. The EPS surprise was +13.64%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Washington companies and stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, the state of Washington would be the 30th largest country in the world, with a GDP of $677 billion in 2021. This is aided by being home to some of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world, including one of only 4 companies in the world which have a market cap of more than $1 trillion. Home to two of the biggest tech companies in the world, Washington also has some of the highest concentration of STEM workers in the country.25 biggest Washington companies and stocksPixabay/Public DomainSeveral industries are extremely important to Washington's GDP including agriculture/food manufacturing, aerospace, clean technology, information and communication technology, life science, maritime and of course the military/defense sectors. Washington is considered to be a global leader in aircraft and uncrewed aerial systems while the agriculture sector is home to around 300 crop commodities whose markets are continuing to expand growth including eliminating trade barriers, streamlined regulations and more efficient transportation in addition to ensuring that the state's farmlands are protected. Clean technology has been a major focus for the state of Washington and innovation and growth in this sector, which is beneficial for reducing our impact on the planet, and incentives are offered in this respect which we'll come back to later. But of course, the leading sector is information and technology, with the state benefitting from a wealth of talent located there.Currently, the unemployment rate for the state of Washington is 4%, which is higher than the national average and ranks 33rd among all state in the country. This is despite the plethora of jobs created by the biggest Washington companies and stocks. This isn't a recent trend, as historically, the state of Washington's unemployment rate has generally been higher than the national average because of a high share of resource-based industries because of which employment rates fluctuate. This will of course not be helped by the state's biggest company laying off 18,000 people.Story continuesTo encourage businesses, Washington state provides various incentives and as mentioned earlier, there are specific incentives related to renewable energy including sales tax exemptions for qualifying solar equipment from July 2019 to December 2029 while the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System allowing business systems to deduct up to 85% of the cost of solar equipment from their tax liability over a period of 5 years.The biggest Washington companies and stocks have combined revenues of well over $1 trillion while the combined market cap is close to $3.5 trillion, though a large majority of both of these numbers is derived from just the top 4 companies. For our ranking, we first selected all Washington  companies included in Fortune 500 while scouring the internet for more top companies for which financial data is available, regardless of whether they're listed or not. Their revenue was determined either from Fortune 500, Yahoo Finance, annual reports or press releases while market cap was confirmed form Yahoo Finance, with 60% weightage assigned to revenue and 40% to market cap.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 best countries in basketball.One of the most popular sports in the world, basketball is over a century old, which is relatively new compared to other popular sports such as football or tennis. However, the fast-paced nature of the sport combined with high scores and a high entertainment value has seen its audience grow across the world, but particularly in the U.S.You might be forgiven for thinking that the National Basketball Association, or the NBA as it is more popularly known, is the oldest basketball organization in the world. After all, it was established almost 80 years ago and is the premier basketball league in the world. However, the first professional basket league was the National Basketball League established in 1898, and which lasted just 6 years.16 best countries in basketballEugene Onischenko/Shutterstock.comFrom relatively obscure beginnings, which led to the first professional basketball league disbanding in a few years, basketball is now a truly global sport with a following of hundreds of millions of people, while the NBA is among the richest professional sports leagues in the world. The major fan following, especially in the U.S., has attracted incredibly lucrative broadcasting deals, which has led to it becoming a huge source of revenue for various stakeholders, from teams and players to sponsors and broadcasters. In fact, from a business perspective, basketball provides various opportunities to generate revenue, including broadcasting rights, sponsorship deals, merchandise sales and ticket sales, which also then contribute to the economy of the best countries in basketball.Some of the most valuable sports companies in the world are basketball teams, all of them in the NBA. This includes teams such as the Golden State Warriors and New York Knicks which combined are worth well over $10 billion, which is an astronomical figure for sports teams, and makes them more valuable than arguably more global football teams such as Real Madrid Football Club or Manchester United plc (NYSE:MANU), both of which have a huge global fanbase. Meanwhile, other teams such as the Los Angeles Lakers and Chicago Bulls are also each worth billions of dollars. These teams consistently sell out their home games which brings in higher revenue from ticket sales while the sport's popularity has led to a creation of a luxury market in this respect, including luxury boxes and VIP seating.Story continuesAnother important source of revenue for basketball is broadcast rights. As mentioned earlier, because of the sport's appeal, basketball is highly sought after by broadcasters, who are willing to pay large amounts of money for the rights to air games. For example, the NBA has a multi-billion dollar broadcast deal with The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) ESPN and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:WBD) TNT, which allows the league to reach a wide audience. Meanwhile, sponsorship deals are also an important part in the business of basketball. Teams and players have partnerships with a range of companies, from sports apparel brands like NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) to fast food chains like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). These deals provide teams and players with additional revenue streams while merchandise sales are another important revenue generator for basketball. Teams and players have merchandise lines which earns sports teams additional millions in revenue.Currently, Spain is the number one country in the world of basketball, topping the rankings by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). This is primarily because Spain is the current World Champion and European champion, and knocked off the U.S. from the number one spot after an uninterrupted reign of 12 years! However, we don't believe that Spain tops the list of the best countries in basketball. Yes, it may have won the World Cup when the competition was last hosted but that alone does not determine if the country is the best. When Greece won the football Euros in 2004, it was nowhere close to the level of other European footballing nations but luck, courage and determination allowed it to win all its games 1-0 in the knockout stages, after only qualifying from the group stage not on points or goal difference, but just number of goals scored. However, it is true that Spain has invested heavily in the country's basketball infrastructure which has seen it rise to this level, and this could allow the nation to reap more benefits in the next several years.That's why, to determine the best countries in basketball, we decided to first determine the gold, silver and bronze medal winners in the Olympics and the World Cup in the sport of basketball. We then added all gold, silver and bronze medals for each country, before assigning 70% weightage to gold, 20% to silver and 10% to bronze, since a gold medal is by far the most important one. There aren't many countries which have achieved significant success in basketball, so it was easier to finalize the list. For Russia, we added all achievements by Russia, Yugoslavia and Soviet Union. So now, let's take a look at the giants of basketball, with a few standouts, starting with:16. ChileTotal gold medals in World Cup / Olympics: 0Total silver medals in World Cup / Olympics: 0Total bronze medals in World Cup / Olympics: 2Two bronze medals in 1950 and 1959 allows Chile to be counted among the best countries in basketball.15.

BulgariaTotal gold medals in World Cup / Olympics: 0Total silver medals in World Cup / Olympics: 1Total bronze medals in World Cup / Olympics: 1Bulgaria's only Olympic medals have been as a result of the success of their brilliant women's basketball team.10. ChinaTotal gold medals in World Cup / Olympics: 0Total silver medals in World Cup / Olympics: 1Total bronze medals in World Cup / Olympics: 1China has dominated the Olympics in various categories in the last couple of decades along with the U.S. but it has met limited success in basketball, even though it is among the best Asian teams in basketball. China's only medals in either the World Cup or the Olympics games have come from the women's team.9. CroatiaTotal gold medals in World Cup / Olympics: 0Total silver medals in World Cup / Olympics: 1Total bronze medals in World Cup / Olympics: 1Croatia has one silver medal in the 1992 Olympics while it earned a bronze medal in the 1994 FIBA World Cup, in its most glorious era in basketball.8. AustraliaTotal gold medals in World Cup / Olympics: 0Total silver medals in World Cup / Olympics: 3Total bronze medals in World Cup / Olympics: 3Australia's entry in this list is courtesy of the successful women's team in the country, which has won 5 medals in the Olympics, while the men's team has one a single bronze medal.7.

I want to thank my 2,400 hard-working colleagues across Equity Residential for all they do every day to delight our customers,"" said Mark J. Parrell, Equity Residential’s President and CEO. ""Turning to 2023, we have seen the year begin with the usual sequential improvement in demand and rate. We expect to again deliver above trend same store operating results driven by the momentum embedded in our rent roll from a stellar 2022, continuing solid demand and limited expense growth, but also expect the slowing economy to dampen intraperiod rent growth during 2023. Overall, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Our affluent resident demographic remains highly employable with the unemployment rate for college graduates at 2%. We also see elevated home ownership costs and manageable competitive new apartment supply as further positive factors.""Recent HighlightsThe Company reported a 10.6% increase in same store revenue for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021, driven by strong demand. Same store expense growth for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021 was a moderate 3.6%, benefitting from favorable real estate tax growth and declines in payroll expense primarily due to the Company's various innovation and centralization initiatives.The Company has provided full year 2023 guidance with same store revenue growth expected to be between 4.5% and 6.0%.During 2022, the Company was a net seller of approximately $633.2 million of attractively priced non-core properties, the proceeds from which were utilized to pay down near-term debt maturities, reducing refinancing needs for 2023.In October 2022, the Company further enhanced liquidity and financial flexibility by entering into a new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in 2027 that replaces the prior facility of the same size that was set to mature in 2024.The Company was recently recognized as one of America’s Most Responsible Companies for 2023 by Newsweek.Story continuesFull Year 2023 GuidanceThe Company has provided guidance for its full year 2023 same store operating performance, EPS, FFO per share and Normalized FFO per share as listed below:Same Store (includes Residential and Non-Residential):Physical Occupancy96.2%Revenue change (1)4.5% to 6.0%Expense change4.0% to 5.0%Net Operating Income (NOI) change4.75% to 6.25%EPS (2)$1.49 to $1.59FFO per share (2)$3.66 to $3.76Normalized FFO per share (2)$3.70 to $3.80Transactions (3):Consolidated rental acquisitions–Consolidated rental dispositions–(1)We anticipate that revenue change will be negatively impacted by approximately 0.9% at the midpoint due to continuing elevated levels of forecasted Bad Debt, Net in 2023, as a result of a slower return to normal resident payment patterns due to local governmental restrictions primarily in California and a lack of governmental rental assistance.(2)The Company expects to incur additional casualty losses in the first quarter of 2023 related to Northern and Southern California rainstorms, estimates of which are included in guidance.(3)Given current uncertainty in the transaction environment, the Company's full year 2023 acquisition and disposition guidance reflects no anticipated activity.The difference between the Company's full year 2022 actual EPS of $2.05 and the full year 2023 EPS guidance midpoint of $1.54 is due primarily to lower expected property sale gains and the items described below.The difference between the Company's full year 2022 actual FFO of $3.53 per share and the full year 2023 FFO guidance midpoint of $3.71 per share is due primarily to the items described below.The difference between the Company's full year 2022 actual Normalized FFO of $3.52 per share and the full year 2023 Normalized FFO guidance midpoint of $3.75 per share is due primarily to:Positive/(Negative)ImpactFull Year 2023 vsFull Year 2022Residential same store NOI$0.26Lease-Up NOI0.022023 and 2022 transaction activity impact on NOI, net(0.02)Corporate overhead (1)(0.02)Other items(0.01)Net$0.23(1)Corporate overhead includes property management and general and administrative expenses.The Company has a glossary of defined terms and related reconciliations of Non-GAAP financial measures on pages 29 through 34 of this release.

We were, however, pleased that our New Lease Change performance remained positive in the fourth quarter of 2022 and in January 2023, contrary to historical patterns,"" said Michael L. Manelis, Equity Residential’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. ""While it is very early in the year, we are seeing typical sequential improvement in rents and leasing activity with New Lease Change and Blended Rate in January 2023 higher as compared to December 2022, suggesting that the year is beginning in a way consistent with normal demand trends.""Investment ActivityThe Company did not acquire any operating properties during the fourth quarter of 2022. During the full year of 2022, the Company acquired a 172-unit apartment property in San Diego, built in 2020, for $113.0 million at an Acquisition Cap Rate of 3.5% as well as two unconsolidated land parcels for future development for approximately $56.9 million.The Company did not sell any properties during the fourth quarter of 2022.

This is evidenced by Deloitte's 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook, which revealed that only 40% of global real estate chief financial officers (CFOs) expected to finish 2022 with higher revenues than last year, and 33% anticipated cuts to expenses, citing sustained high inflation, workforce management, and cyber as the top risks to financial performance.According to a report by GrandViewResearch, the global real estate market size was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030. The market is expected to grow at a healthy pace during the forecast period, owing to the rising population and a desire for personal household space. As of 2021, the commercial real estate space was estimated to be the most important element driving industry expansion. Additionally, in terms of revenue, rental real estate types dominated the market with a share of 52.1% in 2021. This is attributable to rising home prices in developed countries, owing to which there is a rise in the number of renters, favoring the segment growth.Story continuesThe pandemic caused significant changes in consumer demand, which led retailers to modernize their systems to better adapt to these changes. This includes improved analytics and strategies to maintain customer loyalty in response to changing consumer preferences. This holds especially true for Gen Z as it is highly dependent on technology and relies more on the internet and social media to make purchasing and lifestyle decisions. Since Gen Z has experienced technology their entire lives, leasing and marketing campaigns for real estate services should incorporate the use of technology to reach this generation where they are most active, which includes social media, or any other internet source.20 Most Valuable Real Estate Companies in the Worldjason-dent-w3eFhqXjkZE-unsplashOur Methodology We used stock screeners to identify the most valuable real estate companies in the world based on market capitalization as of February 1, 2023.

Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.2%. View our latest analysis for Xylem Xylem's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Based on the last payment, Xylem was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 111.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 33% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendXylem Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.405 total annually to $1.32. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately, Xylem's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year. The company has been growing at a pretty soft 1.3% per annum, and is paying out quite a lot of its earnings to shareholders. This could mean the dividend doesn't have the growth potential we look for going into the future.Xylem Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Xylem is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

As we indicated in our press release, the team delivered a very strong operational performance in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations across each segment and region. Resilient demand and strong backlog execution delivered 20% revenue growth for the quarter and healthy EBITDA margin expansion. That performance continued and built upon the team's solid delivery through the year, fueling healthy momentum coming into 2023. On a full year basis, revenue grew 11% and earnings per share grew 14%. Water Infrastructure grew 15% in the quarter on robust utilities and industrial demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, and the segment was up 12% for the full year. M&amp;CS posted very strong fourth quarter performance.This segment was up 35% in the quarter on backlog execution from improved chip supply and continued strong demand, bringing full year growth to 8%. Applied Water grew 17% in the quarter and finished 2022 with 14% growth for the full year. Overall, higher volumes and positive price cost performance drove significant EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter, up 250 basis points versus the same period a year ago. The team delivered that growth and margin performance on continuing resilient demand globally. We saw healthy orders growth sequentially. And for the full year, orders were up 4%, demonstrating the durability of our business. I am so proud of the team's performance in serving our customers and of their commitment to our purpose, solving water.The global trends driving investment in water systems continue to intensify. And as today's results demonstrate, we are already very strongly positioned to address them. That said, our recent agreement to acquire Evoqua announced 2 weeks ago, will create a powerful platform to address the world's most critical water challenges with greater capability, depth and scale. We've begun the important work of integration planning to set the combined company up for success and are well into the process of seeking the necessary approvals. Until the deal closes, which we anticipate will be midyear, we remain focused on delivering results to the stakeholders we serve today. On that stand-alone basis, we see continuing resilient demand in our largest end markets, particularly utilities, despite the possibility of macroeconomic softness, Execution of our backlogs with ongoing price cost discipline, further supply chain improvements and a return to 100% free cash flow conversion.We expect that this will allow us to deliver 2023 organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $3 and $3.25, up 10% versus last year at the midpoint of the range. We'll give more color on the outlook and guide in a moment, but first, I'll hand it over to Sandy to dig in briefly on the quarter's results before we look ahead at 2023.Sandy Rowland: Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll cover our fourth quarter results. As Patrick highlighted, the team closed out a strong 2022 with another quarter of robust growth and margin expansion. Revenue grew 20% year-over-year, led by 26% growth in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in Western Europe and the emerging markets. In a moment, I'll give you a detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 24%, with strength in the U.S. driven by chip supply improvements in M&amp;CS, and robust OpEx demand in Water Infrastructure. Industrial grew 15% on particularly strong demand in Western Europe and emerging markets and sustained strength in the U.S. Commercial was up 24%, mainly due to continued backlog execution in the U.S. and Western Europe.And residential was up 17%, driven by strength in emerging markets, partially offset by softness in the U.S. Compared to prior year, orders were down 3% in the quarter versus up 23% in the same period last year, but underlying demand remains resilient and in line sequentially. Water Infrastructure orders were up 13%, AWS down 6% and M&amp;CS down 19%, following exceptionally high orders last year. However, M&amp;CS orders were in line with the last quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x. EBITDA margin was 18.7%, up 250 basis points from the prior year and up 40 basis points sequentially on strong volume and price, which more than offset inflation. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.92, up 46% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail.Water Infrastructure outperformed expectations with revenues up 15% in the quarter. Growth was robust across the portfolio, led by our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and industrial strength in emerging markets on continued dewatering demand. Geographically, the U.S. was up 26% with solid price realization on strong utilities OpEx demand and continued improvements in the supply chain. Foster Europe grew low double digits, driven by healthy industrial activity and emerging markets was also up low double digits, driven by dewatering demand in Latin America and Africa. Orders in the fourth quarter were up 13% with solid dewatering demand in emerging markets and continued utility strength in the U.S. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 80 basis points as price, net of inflation and volume conversion more than offset strategic investments.Please turn to Page 7. The Applied Water segment also exceeded expectations with fourth quarter revenues up 17% on strong price realization and backlog execution. Geographically, Western Europe was up over 20%, led by supply chain improvements and strong industrial and commercial demand. Emerging Markets was up mid-double digits on strong residential demand in the Middle East and India. The U.S. was up low double digits as supply chain improvements and price realization were partially offset by moderating residential volumes. Orders were down 6% in the quarter, with healthy industrial demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, offset by slowing U.S. residential orders. Segment EBITDA margin was up 270 basis points in the quarter. Margin expansion was driven by continued strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation and further supplemented by productivity savings.And now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Measurement &amp; Control Solutions business. M&amp;CS revenue was up 35%, driven by recoveries in chip supply year-over-year and strong project execution in our test and measurement and pipeline assessment services businesses. Geographically, all regions were up more than 20%, led by U.S. growth of over 40%. M&amp;CS orders were down 19% in the quarter, lapping a prior year compare of 28% orders growth during the peak of supply chain constraints. Demand for our AMI offering remains strong and our $2.1 billion backlog in M&amp;CS is up 14% versus prior year. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 800 basis points versus the prior year and importantly, 130 basis points quarter sequentially. Strong volume conversion, coupled with price realization offsetting inflation, drove the expansion.And now let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $302 million. The team did a great job driving down working capital to hit our previous outlook of 80% free cash flow conversion for the year. While inventory remains elevated versus where we targeted to be longer term, as there still are pockets of the supply chain that necessitate the extra safety stock that we are carrying, our performance in Q4 gives us confidence in our path to return to 100% conversion in 2023. Our financial position remains robust as we exit the year with over $900 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.7 billion. And this is after paying down over $500 million of debt in December.Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.0x. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll hand back to Patrick to look forward at 2023.Patrick Decker: Thanks, Sandy. The team did an excellent job delivering for our customers and communities in 2022. Their commitment and performance stood out during a tumultuous year of global economic and geopolitical uncertainty; lingering pandemic effects, especially in China; and a challenging supply chain environment. I'm very proud of everything the team achieved, and they are already carrying all that commercial momentum, operational discipline and resilience into 2023. As we look forward, we see continued healthy demand in our major markets despite the possibility of macroeconomic softness in certain sectors of the global economy. We expect that the essential nature of our solutions and the secular trends in water will continue to underpin demand in the attractive, stable end markets that we serve.And we expect to be even better able to serve that demand as supply chain friction continues to ease, and we can progressively work down our $3.6 billion backlogs. Looking ahead, we are advancing our strategic delivery of solutions to the acquisition of Evoqua. As I mentioned earlier, and as you would expect, until the deal closes, we are only providing organic guidance for Xylem on a stand-alone basis. But there's no doubt that the combination of Xylem's global utility scale and Evoqua's strength in attractive industrial end markets creates a powerful platform for growth. We expect significant revenue synergies in areas such as cross-selling of our respective utility and industrial portfolios in North America, and growing Evoqua's international exposure via Xylem's global channels and customer relationships.Water, Technology, TestingPhoto by RephiLe water on UnsplashNow those are just 2 of the areas where we see tremendous potential to add to the growth of the combined companies and expand our value to customers globally, especially in a number of the most attractive water end markets. But it's not the only inorganic move we're making to give customers more of what they need most. We've also taken a big step forward in helping them adopt the digital solutions they need to increase the resilience of communities essential water infrastructure. In the shadow of our big announcement with Evoqua, another important partnership flew under the radar, one which will accelerate and enhance our ability to deliver more digital solutions to the utility customers around the world. Last quarter, we signed an exclusive commercial partnership with Idrica to make adoption of digital technologies easier, faster and more affordable for our utility customers.Headquartered in Valentia, Spain, Idrica is a leader in data management and analytics for water utilities. Idrica's GoAigua platform simplifies deployment and operation of new digital capabilities in any water utilities operations. It gives them one secure integrated interface that brings together data capture, analytics and asset and process management onto 1 platform. Having been born out of a utility operator itself, the platform has the advantage of having been built by utility for utilities, and it's already been deployed by over 300 customers around the world. Under the partnership, we will take a minority stake in Idrica and become the exclusive global distributor of their technology. Together, we will enable more utilities to harness the power of connected solutions.We're very excited about it, and we look forward to sharing more as the partnership progresses. We made one other important announcement recently. This one was just before the end of the year, appointing Matthew Pine as Chief Operating Officer. The move ensures that we have continuing focus on operational excellence from an enterprise perspective across all our business segments and regions to continue delivering on our commitment to faster-than-market revenue growth and margin expansion. At the same time, it's also freed up some of my capacity to deliver on Xylem's strategic evolution and capital deployment. In a moment, we'll turn the call back to Sandy for more detail on our guide. But first, I want to invite Matthew to say a few words on his key areas of focus in the new role and provide some color on our end market outlook.Matthew?Matthew Pine: Thanks, Patrick. We are very strongly positioned on intensifying trends with technology leadership in a large and growing installed base in attractive end markets. My focus as Chief Operating Officer is to further accelerate profitable growth and maximize the value we deliver to customers and communities around the world. Across the business, we continue to remove complexity, increase our local agility and unlock further scale efficiencies. This is all aimed, of course, at better serving our customers at the same time we deliver continuing margin expansion. We're driving this margin focus across the enterprise, taking particular aim at even more enhanced productivity and customer satisfaction. For example, in the M&amp;CS segment, improvements in chip supply enabled us to build momentum, delivering the accretive backlog, we deploy resources back to productivity as well as new product introductions from innovation.Secondly, we continue to enhance our digital portfolio, as Patrick covered. Our customers need simple, integrated digital technologies that solve their problems cost effectively. Our portfolio increasingly meets that demand with attractive growth and margin profiles. Lastly, our customers depend on Xylem as a trusted partner to deliver ongoing support. So our third operational focus is in standardizing our solutions and creating new offerings. This will take us deeper into our installed base with aftermarket sales and services. New offerings such as outcome-based solutions and condition-based maintenance will enable us to capture demand, address customers' needs and expand reoccurring revenues. It's no accident that there's a theme running through all 3 of these priorities.Each is about growing revenues and improving our margins by serving our customers better, more thoroughly and more simply, making it even easier for them to do business with us and solve more of their challenges. When we talk about being in a privileged position, that's not mentally to refer to our strategic or market positioning. It also reflects our view that we are fortunate to work alongside the kind of customers that we do, partner with them to solve their critical water challenges they face. It's a privilege and also a great opportunity for continuing value creation from our shareholders, communities and all stakeholders. Now let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market outlook. We expect underlying demand and most of our end markets will continue to be healthy through 2023.We've taken a balanced view based on the strength of our backlog, critical nature of our largest end markets, and the continued value proposition of our differentiated products. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is our largest end market, will grow high single digits in 2023. On the wastewater side, we expect mid-single-digit growth as we see a continuation of steady global demand. We anticipate resilient OpEx demand in developed markets due to the critical nature of our offerings as well as the benefit of continued CapEx spend in emerging markets. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains robust. On the clean water side, we anticipate revenues being up low teens. This growth is driven by continued robust demand for our AMI solutions and expected improvements in ship supply through 2023, allowing for significant large deal deployments already secured in our backlog.We foresee healthy momentum in our test and measurement and our pipeline assessment service businesses due to increased focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. Looking at the industrial end market, we expect to go low to mid-single digits on steady demand for our solutions globally. We continue to see strong growth in dewatering due to mining demand in emerging markets and the benefits of our strategic investments in our U.S. and European dewatering business. The commercial end market should deliver low single-digit growth on solid replacement business and backlog execution, partially offset by moderation in new construction. In residential, our smallest end market, we are expecting low single-digit decline due to normalizing demand in the U.S., partially offset by continued strength in emerging markets.In both commercial and residential, we would expect moderation to emerge in the second half results as we continue to work through the backlog in the first half of 2023. Now I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through our updated guidance.Sandy Rowland: Thank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 12. As mentioned, we expect Evoqua to join us in mid-2023. We Until then, our full year guidance is on an organic basis and excludes the combination of the 2 companies. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2023 revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6%. This breaks down by segment as follows: mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure with solid growth in both wastewater utilities and industrial; low single-digit growth in Applied Water from growth in industrial and commercial, partially offset by residential; We expect Measurement &amp; Control Solutions to be up low teens. For 2023, we expect EBITDA to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. This represents a 50 to 100 basis point margin expansion versus prior year.And this yields an EPS range of $3 to $3.25, up 10% at the midpoint over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be 100% of net income.

Also, favorable inflation data has been helping investors regain the lost confidence as they now feel that the economy may have a soft landing in 2023 and a recession might be avoided.Easing inflation has also made the Fed go slow on its aggressive interest rate hike policy. The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points on Feb 1 to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%. This marks the highest interest rate since 2007.Alongside the interest rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell also said that the central bank finally thinks for the first time that the “deflationary process” has started. The Fed started going slow on its rate hikes in December when it increased interest rates by 50 basis points after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes.The decision to go slow on rate hikes is definitely a good sign but the crisis is far from over, given that inflation is still at multi-year highs.Also, on Feb 8, several Fed officials went on record saying that more interest rate hikes can be expected in 2023 as its fight to cool inflation continues. New York Fed President John Williams called a federal funds rate of something between 5.00% and 5.25% would be a “reasonable view” of what the central bank could do this year to further ease inflation. Thus, as indicated by Powell, there are few chances of rate cuts in 2023.Given this situation, an astute investor should decide to keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks right now. This is because dividend stocks with a proven track record and a solid business plan can withstand market turbulence.In addition to ensuring a constant flow of income, they minimize the likelihood of price swings.

Nice transition.JOSH SCHAFER: We'll spin the roulette table, all right? We're going to talk gambling.DAVE BRIGGS: We're both in.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, take a look at shares of MGM. They're in the green today after an upbeat earnings report with sales of 3.59 billion, besting Wall Street estimates. And the company casting a positive light on the return of not only Las Vegas gambling, but also Macau and China. So CEO Bill Hornbuckle saying in today's earnings call, March is positioned to be the best hotel revenue month in company history. That's, in large, part due to the big dance, March Madness, Sweet 16, and the Elite Eight are going to be in Vegas this year.And last note here, Dave, I want to point out. I want to look at Wynn, too. Investors appear to be happy with what both Wynn and MGM had to say about their operations in Macau. MGM says quarter to date, that's their highest earning part of their business. And then Wynn adding the company has, quote, ""great confidence that the difficulties are behind us,"" again, specifically in Macau. Maybe we're finally turning a corner there. I feel like we've been talking about this for months, guys, and it's one day's positive, the next day's negative. So who knows what comes?DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, it sure looks like the worst is behind them. Hornbuckle said, simply stated, Macau is back. And when it comes to Vegas, it's astonishing, man. I was there recently. Everything in sight was packed. And Hornbuckle also said on the call that the LVC VA says flights to Vegas are at 120% of capacity from 2019 levels.SEANA SMITH: Wow.DAVE BRIGGS: 120% from prior to the pandemic. Vegas is not just back-- it's bigger than ever before.SEANA SMITH: It sounds like it's booming. If I'm planning a vacation because I haven't gone on one since the start of COVID, I'm personally not going to Las Vegas. So I'm a little surprised that those numbers are so high. But when you talk about that type of demand, these companies are able to charge much more for their daily rates. MGM's daily rate up 30%. That's a massive jump that we're seeing here.Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: Highest revenue ever.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Ever. I mean, that's [INAUDIBLE].DAVE BRIGGS: Me and Josh are going.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, check out 5 Most Valuable Hotel Companies In The World. Hotel and lodging industry revenue has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2022 was expected to end with $188 billion in revenue, an increase of 11% compared to 2019. However, adjusted for inflation, revenue per available room is not projected to exceed pre-pandemic levels until 2025. Hospitality companies who provide liquor and live entertainment might have to allocate 5% to 20% more budget for insurance in 2023, and establishments with facilities such as spa services will see rate increases as well. Hospitality industry profit margins will deteriorate in 2023 due to supply chain constraints, inflation, and higher wages pressuring profit margins. Based on strength in Q1 2022, ongoing halts in construction, greater inflation, and positive employment data, CBRE lifted its forecast of hotel performance for 2022 and beyond. CBRE said it anticipates complete rebound in average daily rate in 2022 and in demand and revenue per available room in 2023. Regardless of COVID-19 challenges, RevPAR in Q1 2022 came in at $72.20, above 61% from the prior year quarter. RevPAR growth was fueled by a 39% raise in ADR and 16% higher occupancy. Rachael Rothman, CBRE’s head of hotel research &amp; data analytics, said on May 31, 2022: “To date, there has been no sign that the more than 50 percent increase in gas prices and the stock market’s hovering near bear-market territory are dampening hotel demand. However, in the past, a steep decline in the S&amp;P 500 and high gas prices have often caused RevPAR growth to decline, which raises the specter of a pullback in RevPAR later this year. Despite this possibility, our outlook remains that the market will continue to recover.”The RevPAR growth in 2023 will result from equal parts of occupancy and average daily rate increases, which are expected to climb 4.2% during the year. The inventory of high-priced hotels is anticipated to escalate 2.1% in 2023, higher than the supply growth rates of 0.1% for lower and 2% for mid-priced hotels. Story continuesTo benefit from the lucrative hotel industry, investors can pick up stocks of some of the most valuable hotel companies like Marriott International, Inc.

Airline and travel reservations and hotel management have not been happy places to be in the past year, although it is worth noting nowhere near as bad as investing in actual airlines or hotels. InterContinental’s share price fall of -9.9% compares with a drop of -35.1% for the Dow Jones US Hotel and Lodging REIT Index. This illustrates the virtues of InterContinental’s business model in contrast to the industry it serve.However, whilst they face a difficult situation, we are pleased that management has spent its time and effort managing liquidity and costs in an effort to ensure that they survive these events rather than pointlessly speculating about the likely timescale and course of recovery. We believe that they should not only survive but also strengthen their competitive position.”8. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc.

(NASDAQ:HST) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Shares of Host Hotels (HST) were also sold during the 3rd quarter for similar reasons as Cogent given a degradation in the prospect of a return in group leisure and business travel. The capital was similarly redeployed.”7.

Wynn Resorts is out with a mixed picture on its quarterly results. However, the company announcing this morning its plan for a private offering of $600 million of Wynn Resorts financed senior notes due 2031. A brighter picture on the earnings front for MGM Resorts, though, international, beating revenue estimates and reporting a narrower than expected earnings loss here.I just want to kind of swing back to Wynn Resorts for a hot second here. One thing that I've been doing, a quick Ctrl Command F on in these earnings reports and the earnings calls as well is anything on Macau, anything on China.And you heard that in the Wynn call last night from Craig Billings, the CEO there, saying that the recent actions in Macau and mainland authorities reopening the market give them some good confidence that the difficulties are behind them here. So, to what extent that begins to show up in future earnings reports, that will be something to keep a close eye on here as we move forward with regard to this broader kind of reopening to the travel and tourism landscape here, too.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, that's a good tip, Brad. Just in reading earnings calls in general-- I know we're focusing here on Wynn, but reading some of these transcripts and just pull out keywords. Some of the keywords I use to just mine this data, right now, it's China. It is disinflation. And of course, it's economy. And you'd be surprised some of the themes that you can quickly put together just by doing that.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, it's hard to overstate what a dramatic change these businesses had over the past few years because they had been so weighted to China. I mean, both of these companies, whether you're talking about WIM or Wynn or MGM, both of them get Vegas revenue. They get other regional casinos in the US. In the case of MGM, it's a bunch of them. In the case of Wynn, it's mostly Boston.Story continuesAnd then you have China mostly-- or, I guess, all in Macau, right? And the China revenue had basically gone away over the past few years, both because of regulation then, obviously, because of COVID. So now they're essentially trying to rebuild that business. But the shift in revenue, I mean, I can't imagine working in an operation. You must get seasick from the sort of back and forth happens from that. And that's still the case that the China revenue is much smaller as a percentage of the whole than it was before.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, they gave actually some stats to that effect as well, to your point, Julie, saying the Chinese New Year holiday period in that period, the casino, the mass table drop actually reached 95% of 2019 Chinese New Year levels, strong play across the spectrum and premium. And within this premium experience, people go into casinos. You know you're going to spend money at the end of the day. It's like when you're going to Disney World. You know you're going to spend money. And so--JULIE HYMAN: You just surrender. It's just gonna happen.BRAD SMITH: Just take my money. Just take the cash here. And so-- and that's a specific part of the experience economy that is perhaps a divergence between where you're looking to find value in that experience economy and find a deal versus where you just know you're going to spend. And who is best to benefit from that? Perhaps it could be some of the casinos if the golden age of travel still holds true and has some solid tailwinds to it. And then, additionally, it could be Disney at the end of the day as well.JULIE HYMAN: Well, in China, they haven't had the bounce back that we've had here, right? They're much earlier in that cycle. They've just opened up. People, I'm sure, are raring to go.BRIAN SOZZI: It's your move, by the way, Brad, in our digital poker game. No, I'm just kidding.]"

Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.Gene Hall: Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove a strong performance in the fourth quarter with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS. We generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow and we returned even more than that to shareholders through our ongoing share repurchase program. Enterprise leaders are dealing with high volatility and uncertainty. Inflation accelerated to the highest level in 40-years. The dollar was the strongest it's been in 20-years and it remains extremely volatile. There are ongoing supply chain issues, energy prices has been volatile. The labor market has been volatile. Enterprises are assessing the impact of remote versus hybrid versus in-person work. There are widespread concerns of a recession.Story continuesAll of these factors and more impact enterprises around the world. Leaders need help navigating this turbulent time and they know Gartner is the best source for that help. Our services often make the difference between success and failure for executives and their enterprises. We help clients succeed with their mission critical priorities, whether they're in growth mode or cutting costs. With all this volatility, our most recent research shows that Chief Financial Officers are more carefully scrutinizing expenses. But at the same time, they're increasing investment and mission critical priorities. Even in enterprises, they are under extreme financial pressure. Our research business continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We help leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world.Our market opportunity is fast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever. Research revenue grew 13% in the fourth quarter. Total contract value growth was 12%. Contract value growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. We serve the executives and their teams through two distinct sales channels: global technology sales or GTS is our largest sales force. GTS contract value grew 11%. The large majority of GTS serves IP leaders and their teams and we saw double-digit growth with this client segment despite tough compares. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs and product managers. In this segment, growth moderated, but still grew at high-single-digits, despite even tougher compares.Global Business Sales or GBS serves leaders in their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 19% in 2022. In the five years since we launched our GXL products within GBS, we've seen exceptional compound annual growth rates. Gartner conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights and engaged and qualified audience. In the first half of 2022, we delivered most of our conferences virtually. In the second half, we pivoted back to in-person for nearly all our conferences. Feedback has been excellent. Most in-person conferences were sold out in 2022 and we've sold significantly more than half of our exhibitor space for 2023. Gartner consulting is an extension of Gartner Research.Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter. We exited the year with a strong backlog and pipeline. Our business is fueled by our highly talented associates. During 2022, we grew our team by about 2,900 associates. With this growth, we ended 2022 with the lowest percentage of open positions ever. When we're fully staffed, we provide our clients better service, which results in better retention. We also sell more in territories that are fully staffed. We have carefully aligned our hiring with recent demand and the long-term opportunity we have for growth. Our 2023 outlook reflects our most recent experiences from Q4.We've also been prudent in considering the potential impact of volatility from the global environment. We expect to deliver at least 21.5% margins across a wide range of economic scenarios. And our guidance has opportunity for upside if the business performs in line with historical trends. Craig will take you through our guidance in more detail. One of the unique things about Gartner is that we provide value to enterprises that are thriving, shortly or anywhere in between. By being exceptionally agile and adapting to the changing world, we have sustained record of success. We're well prepared as we enter 2023. We've carefully aligned staffing levels with demand and we have the lowest percentage of open positions ever. Our content addresses today's mission critical priorities.And we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. In closing, we again saw strong growth across the business. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to drive growth far into the future. Even as we invest for future growth, we expect margins to increase modestly over time and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income or return capital to our shareholders through buybacks, which reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.Craig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter results were strong with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. FX neutral growth was even stronger than our reported results. We also delivered better than planned EBITDA margins. During 2022, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow and we returned more than that to shareholders through stock repurchases. Our financial performance for the full-year 2022 included total contract value growth of 12%, total revenue growth of 16%, EBITDA growth of 14%, diluted adjusted EPS of $11.27, and free cash flow of $993 million. We are introducing 2023 guidance, which reflects higher than normal variability in the set of reasonably likely outcomes.The guidance accounts for the tough compares at the start of the year and the opportunity for upside if near-term demand is stronger than we built into the outlook. With the catch up hiring we did last year; we are very well positioned to add value to enterprise function leaders and their teams across all industries and around the world. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year as reported and 20% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, down 100 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $421 million, up 37% year-over-year and up 44% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $3.70, up 24% and free cash flow in the quarter was $166 million. We finished the year with 19,505 associates, up 18% from the end of 2021.About 40% of the headcount growth was catch up from prior years. Our hiring has been carefully calibrated to revenue growth and future demand and we are well positioned from a talent perspective heading into 2023. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 9% year-over-year as reported and 13% on an FX neutral basis driven by our strong contract value growth. Fourth quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with 2021. The contribution margin had a benefit during the quarter from somewhat lower headcount levels and travel expenses still modestly below our post-pandemic expectations. For the full-year 2022, research revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and 16% FX neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74% in line with 2021.Contract value or CV represents the annualized revenue under contract at a point in time. In looking at our global contract value across both GTS and GBS, more than 75% of our CV is from enterprise function leaders and their teams with the bulk of the balance coming from leaders at tech vendors. Our enterprise function leader's business includes IT leaders, who are end users of technology and who we serve through our GTS sales force. And leaders of other business functions who we serve through our GBS sales force. In both cases, we serve leaders around the world and across all industries. We're helping these enterprise function leaders address their most important mission critical priorities. CV was $4.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 11.9% versus the prior year and up 12.3% adjusted for the impact of exiting Russia.CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at strong double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew high-single-digits, compared to a high-teens growth rate in the fourth quarter of 21. Quarterly net contract value increase or NCVI was $189 million business of almost $400 million. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, all industry sectors grew at double-digit rates other than technology and media, which grew at high-single-digit rates. The fastest growth was in the transportation, retail and manufacturing sectors. We had double-digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories. We also drove double-digit growth in nine of our top 10 countries, with high-single-digit growth in the 10.Global technology sales CV was $3.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 10% versus prior year and up 10.5% adjusted for the exit of Russia. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $138 million, while retention for GTS was 105% for the quarter. GTS new business was down 8.5% versus last year. New business with IT function leaders was up modestly year-over-year against a tough compare. New business with tech vendors facing even tougher compare against Q4 of 2021, which was its strongest quarter ever. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 18%, compared to December of last year, about 40% of the growth was catch up hiring from 2021. Our continued investments in our sales teams will drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.Technology, Business, MeetingPhoto by Campaign Creators on UnsplashGlobal business sales CV was over $1 billion at the end of fourth quarter, up 19% year-over-year, which is above the high-end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices other than marketing grew at double-digit growth rates led by supply chain and HR, which both continued to grow faster than 20%. GBS CV increased $52 million from the third quarter, while retention for GBS was 112%. GBS new business was up 3% versus last year against a very strong compare. The two-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 9%. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased 22% year-over-year with a little more than 50% of the growth being catch up from 2021. Headcount we hired in 2022 will help to position us for sustained double-digit growth in the future.As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $188 million, contribution margin in the quarter was 53%, we held nine in-person conferences in the quarter. It has been very exciting for our business to return to in-person conferences. For the full year 2022, revenue increased 82% on a reported basis and 90% FX neutral. Gross contribution margin was 54%. Fourth quarter consulting revenues increased by 17% year-over-year to $138 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 24%. Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the fourth quarter. Labor based revenues were $96 million, up 11% versus Q4 of last year and up 19% on an FX neutral basis.Backlog at December 31 was $140 million, increasing 24% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter. The inclusion of multi-year contracts in our backlog calculation a change we described earlier last year, contributed about 13 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. Our contract optimization business had a very strong quarter increasing 36 % as reported and 39% on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Full-year consulting revenue was up 15% on a reported basis and 22% on an FX neutral basis. Gross contribution margin of 39% was up 140 basis points from 2021. Consolidated cost of services increased 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 24% on an FX neutral basis.The biggest drivers of the increase were higher headcount to support our continued strong growth and the return to in-person destination conferences. SG&amp;A decreased 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and increased 1% on an FX neutral basis. We had lower non-cash non-recurring charges in 2022, compared to 2021. On a comparable basis, SG&amp;A was up due to additional headcount for sales and G&amp;A functions. For the full -year, cost of services increased 17% on a reported basis and 21% on an FX neutral basis. SG&amp;A increased 15% on a reported basis and 19% on an FX neutral basis in 2022. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $421 million, up 37% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 44% FX neutral. Fourth quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our forecasts, most notably in consulting and expenses at the low-end of our expectations.EBITDA for the full-year was $1.47 billion, 14% increase over 2021 on a reported basis and up 19% FX neutral. Depreciation was $24 million in the fourth quarter, down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $29 million about flat with the prior year. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 16.7% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 23.2% for the quarter. The full-year tax rate was 21.6% on the same basis. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.70, up 19% year-over-year. The average share count for the fourth quarter was 80 million shares. This is a reduction of about 3.7 million shares or about 4% year-over-year.We exited the fourth quarter with about 80 million shares outstanding on an unweighted basis. For the full-year, adjusted EPS was $11.27, EPS growth for the year was 22%. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $203 million, excluding insurance proceeds in Q4 of 2021, operating cash flow was down about 7%. Q4 cash flow was impacted by Hurricane Ian, which hit our center of excellence in Fort Myers extremely hard in late September. While we were able to sell and service our clients from Fort Myers, we did have some delays in getting invoices out as quickly as we normally would. Elections for some of these delayed invoices slipped into January, but we are now caught up. CapEx for the quarter was $38 million, up about $16 million year-over-year, led by increases in capitalized technology labor costs and catch-up laptop spend.Free cash flow for the quarter was $166 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. As many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. Our conversion from EBITDA is also very strong. With the differences being cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx, partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 18% on a rolling fourth quarter basis. On the same basis, free cash flow was 68% of EBITDA and 123% of GAAP net income. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had almost $700 million of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing-12-month EBITDA was under 2 times.Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases, and strategic tuck-in M&amp;A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.7 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased more than $1 billion of stock throughout 2022. We expect the Board will refresh our share repurchase authorization as needed, which they did earlier this month. We now have about $1 billion authorized for share repurchases. Across the past two years, we have returned $2.7 billion to shareholders by repurchasing more than 11 million shares. Over that timeframe, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 11%.As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. Before providing the 2023 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2023. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. Our plan allows for a higher-than-normal level of uncertainty in the world as Gene discussed. We've got tough compares across the business and particularly with tech vendors for another quarter or two.We've taken a prudent approach based on historical trends, as well as more normal patterns which we reflected in the guidance. If near-term demand is stronger than we've built into the outlook and NCVI phasing, retention rates, and non-subscription growth performed closer to the way they have historically, there would be upside to our guidance. In addition, our teams are focused on driving greater growth than what's embedded in the guidance. Finally, as you think about GBS overall CV and revenue growth for 2023, please keep in mind that we closed on the divestiture of a small non-core asset last week. We sold Talentneuron which we acquired as part of the CEB transaction for $164 million. In the earnings supplement appendix, we've provided historical contract value updated for 2023 FX rates, as well as the removal of Talentneuron from prior years.For conferences, we are basing our guidance on being 100% in-person for the 47 destination conferences we have planned for 2023. We expect to return to more typical seasonality for the business with fourth quarter the largest followed by the second quarter. For consulting revenues, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization is seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect significant headcount increases from 2022 annualizing into 2023. Our plan for headcount for 2023 is more in line with our normal model as we caught up on hiring last year.If demand is stronger than what's in the initial plan, we will have opportunity to add even more great talent to our teams. We also expect T&amp;E cost to more fully normalize this year. Finally, we continue to invest in our systems and process automation, both client facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins. At current rates, FX will be a modest tailwind to growth for the full-year with the benefit in the second half. Our guidance for 2023 is as follows: we expect research revenue of at least $4.92 billion, which is growth of about 7%. Excluding the effect of the divest adds 1 percentage point to the year-over-year growth rate.We expect conferences revenue of at least $445 million, which is growth of about 14%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $500 million, which is growth of about 4%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.865 billion, which is growth of about 7%. Excluding the divested business from 2022 would add about 80 basis points to the growth rate. As I've mentioned, we've taken a prudent approach to planning for 2023. This applies to revenue, operating expenses and free cash flow. We expect full-year EBITDA of at least $1.26 billion. We expect to be able to deliver at least 21.5% margins in most economic scenarios. If revenue is stronger than our guidance, we expect upside to EBITDA and margins. Included in the guidance is equity comp of $132 million, up from 2022.We expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $8.80 per share. For 2023, we expect free cash flow of at least $920 million. Our EPS guidance is based on 80 million shares, which only assumes repurchases to offset dilution. Finally, for the first quarter of 2023, we expect to deliver at least $310 million of EBITDA. All the details of our full-year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Our strong performance in 2022 continued in the fourth quarter. Contract value grew 12%, adjusted EPS increased 195, fueled in part by the significant reduction of shares in 2021 and 2022. Over the past few years, our hiring has been carefully calibrated to demand and we are well positioned from a top perspective heading into 2023. Our continued investments in our teams will drive long-term sustained double-digit growth.We repurchased more than $1 billion in stock last year and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. As I mentioned, we expect to generate at least $920 million in free cash flow in 2023. In addition, we have ample liquidity and the net proceeds from last week's divestiture for capital deployment initiatives. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth and G&amp;A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA, because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront.And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck-in M&amp;A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned +10.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has gained 6.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.75 per share, indicating a change of -15.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.18 points to a change of +12.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.98 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -5.1%. The $56.21 billion and $58.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.7% and +4.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.2%. EPS of $1.31 for the same period compares with $2.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.84%. The EPS surprise was +4.8%.Over the last four quarters, Morgan Stanley surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has been around for over 100 years. It has a long history of investing in companies that become market leaders. The company is known for its stock picks, and this article will outline some of the stocks that Morgan Stanley has recommended in recent months.Since the start of the year, the global markets have been experiencing a mini-rally triggered by positive U.S. economic data. Inflation is cooling down. And the Federal Reserve is taking notice.The central bank has announced a quarter-point rate increase, the smallest adjustment since March, signaling an easing monetary policy in the country. Last week marked the eighth straight rate hike coming from the Fed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, no investor can afford to be complacent. Last year was a disaster for the broader markets. A consumer spending slowdown may quickly become the new norm, with Wall Street starting to feel the shortfall in profits. Talk of inflation and layoffs has investors worried because they could take a large hit.Morgan Stanley’s investment chief warns clients that earnings reports to come will likely disappoint investors and cause the major stock indexes to drop. Even though it is unlikely a recession will happen, even if it does, the economy is not in as good of shape as people think.Under these circumstances, it will not hurt to consider Morgan Stanley stock picks.AMDAMD$83.79DALDelta$39.61MSFTMicrosoft$256.80Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comWhile semiconductor stocks are facing some difficult times, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is excelling. The stock has been up almost 35% since the start of the year.AMD released earnings with excellent sales but only a bare minimum of profits due to amortization costs associated with the Xilinx acquisition and a significant decrease in PC sales.It posted a 16% year-over-year revenue increase to $5.6 billion from $4.83 billion. However, the net income was $21 million, a steep drop from $974 million in the prior-year quarter. The gross margin was down by 740 basis points to 43%, while the operating costs also increased during this quarter.Story continuesAMD expects its sales to decline during the first quarter of the 2023 fiscal year due to slow demand. The company expects gains in the data center and embedded segment, while sales will be slower in the gaming and client segments.Furthermore, AMD has been riding high on the recent data center boom for quite a long time. Though it is not guaranteed to stay as significant when Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), who still lead the industry, come back to life, AMD is one to watch seriously in the future.Intel has been left in the dust with AMD’s Genoa Server CPUs. Intel is still the market leader. But it won’t hold on to the crown for too much longer. During the fourth quarter of 2022, AMD reported a more than 42% increase in data center sales compared to the prior year. Overall, the performance improved significantly from previous quarters.For 2022, revenues were up by almost 64%, which means that the company is doing exceptionally well in the data center section.Delta Airlines (DAL)Delta (DAL) airlines plane mid take-offSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.comAmong stock picks, Delta (NYSE:DAL) has been a favorite of Morgan Stanley, and with good reason. It posted a bright earnings report for the fourth quarter recently.It is looking to aggressively cut down on costs to continue improving its financial performance even further.The airline made $13.44 billion in total revenue in the final quarter of 2022, a 17% increase from $11.44 billion in the same quarter in 2019.There was a sharp uptick in corporate bookings in the ten days before earnings. And demand for flights to Europe was stronger than ever. This will result in solid results in the coming quarter. In addition, at the end of 2022, Delta had an operating cash flow of $6.2 billion and $9.4 billion in liquidity.Delta had a very successful year in terms of both new members and new cardholders. It gained 8.5 million SkyMiles members and 1.2 million Delta American Express cardholders.Delta is expecting a revenue boost of 14% to 17% and forecasts an increase in EPS of between 4% and 6% in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2019.In addition, Delta is taking meaningful steps towards reducing costs and has already introduced hundreds of fuel-efficient planes to its fleet. Researchers predict that these jet planes will be 20% more effective than the current fleet.In a connected move, Delta is completing its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The company’s Delta Sustainable Skies Lab was introduced at the 2023 Consumer Electronics Show. The lab focuses on sustainable air travel and provides a complete overview of current and future technologies dedicated to this cause.For all these reasons, it is no surprise that Morgan Stanley has named Delta one of its favorites when discussing stock picks.Microsoft (MSFT)In this photo the Microsoft Office 365 logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. AVPT stock, AVPT provides services for Microsoft (MSFT) productsSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an excellent investment that can be used to provide the company with a competitive edge. It has been able to grow steadily since its inception in 1975. And it continues to grow with each passing day.Microsoft’s long history of innovation and success makes it an excellent investment for any company. Microsoft’s services are used by millions of people across the globe, making it a great way for companies to grow their business.Microsoft stock is usually a good long-term pick as it allows new investors to profit greatly over time. However, its investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has been grabbing headlines recently.Microsoft is not immune to change. The interest in ChatGPT is red-hot at the moment. Microsoft, a notable investor, and partner of OpenAI, have provided three rounds of investment into the company. The investment has the potential to turn into something substantial in the future.For Morgan Stanley, the reasons to invest in Microsoft are varied. The tech giant is experiencing significant growth in key public cloud and data management areas. The stock also performed well during security issues recently. In addition, the investment bank believes demand for Microsoft’s products is highly stable. Hence, investor fears regarding churn rates are overblown.MSFT shares are down over 14% in the last year, giving investors an attractive entry point to load up on this name.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Before we start, I would like to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation. Certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and these statements are our present expectations.Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are listed in our earnings materials and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which should be filed tomorrow.

We'll begin the call with an overview of our business from John, then Phil will review our financial results for the quarter. And after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for your questions. I'll now hand the call over to John.John Wren: Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I'm pleased to report our fourth quarter performance was very strong on both the top and bottom lines, and we finished an outstanding year in 2022. We entered 2023 with a high level of confidence in our strategic and financial position while remaining cautious and being prepared for possible changes in the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. For the fourth quarter, organic growth of 7.2% exceeded our expectations. Growth was broad-based across our disciplines, geographic regions and client sectors. We again saw a double-digit growth in our Precision Marketing, Public Relations and Experiential disciplines.Story continuesFull year organic growth was 9.4%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 16.6%, an increase of 50 basis points compared to the prior year. For the full year, operating margin adjusted for certain non-GAAP items illustrated on Page 10 of our investor presentation was 15.4%, which is 40 basis points higher than our operating margin in 2021. Earnings per share for the quarter was $2.09, up 7.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. The negative currency impact on EPS of the strong U.S. dollar was approximately 6%. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased by approximately 13%. For the year, we generated over $1.7 billion in free cash flow and returned more than 65% to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. Our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong and continue to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.Our strong performance validates the growing role we play as clients increasingly turn to us for advice in navigating through a complex marketing and communications environment. We're also advising our clients on transforming their organizations by deploying new processes and marketing technology platforms that can provide more connected experiences for their consumers. During the quarter, we expanded and further strengthened our talent. At the time of our Q3 remarks, we had just appointed Andrea Lennon to the new role of Chief Client Officer. In the fourth quarter, we added two prominent leaders: Kathleen Saxton, previously of MediaLink, joined as Chief Marketing Officer; and Alex Hesz previously of adam&amp;eve and DDB joined as Chief Strategy Officer.Andrea, Kathleen and Alex will strengthen our position in the marketplace, identify and pursue new business opportunities and work with our global client leaders and agencies to deliver innovative and transformational ideas to our clients. We're fortunate to be adding this team from a position of strength. We ended 2022 with significant new business wins and deepened our relationship with many of our enterprise-level clients. In the fourth quarter, L'OrÃ©al named Omnicom Media Group, its U.S. media agency of record. This marked one of the biggest wins of 2022, with an estimated $1 billion in U.S. media billings as reported by COMvergence. L'OrÃ©al selected OMG due to its steep specialization and integration of expertise, talent and technology to deliver modern marketing outcomes.Our recently launched commerce agency, Transact, along with our best-in-class analytics and insights team at Annalect, which supports the Omni operating system played instrumental roles in winning the L'OrÃ©al business. Also on the media front, OMD secured a major win as it was named media agency of record for Burberry. The win includes an innovative and bespoke agency model created specifically for Burberry. Our Healthcare Group, which had 6.4% growth in the fourth quarter, won a significant new business pitch with Merck capping off the year in which it won one of our largest healthcare pitches of 2022. A key component of our new business success was driven by our e-commerce capabilities, an area where we've made and continue to make significant investments.We recently expanded our e-commerce capabilities through our partnership with Albertsons Media Collective, a retail media arm for the Albertsons Companies. This partnership will provide first-to-market solutions that will enable marketers to better target and measure ROI in the connected TV environments. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to solidify our position as best-in-class provider of retail, media and e-commerce services as well as in other high-growth areas such as Precision Marketing, Performance Media and Health. I want to thank our people around the world for helping us close out 2022 on such a positive note. It's your dedication and commitment and outstanding work that allows our agencies, clients and Omnicom to succeed.We entered 2023 in a very strong position, supported by our strong financial performance, new business wins and steady progress on our key strategic initiatives. We also continue to see strong demand for our services. Based on current market conditions, we're targeting 2023 organic revenue growth of 3% to 5% and expect our operating margin to be between 15% and 15.4%. At the same time, we remain extremely cautious of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the ongoing war in the Ukraine, the economic risk posed by rising interest rates and higher inflation around the world. To be prepared, we continue to actively develop plans to respond to the headwinds from macro factors, and I'm confident we can manage through this economic cycle.And we have the leadership teams in place to minimize the impact on our top and bottom lines. I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?Phil Angelastro: Thanks, John. We're pleased to be closing 2022 with solid fourth quarter results, driven by strong organic revenue growth, operating profit growth and earnings per share growth. We finished the year with a healthy balance sheet and excellent liquidity. Our strong credit position and the operating flexibility of our business position us well for any macro uncertainty ahead. Please turn now to Slide 3, and we'll begin our review with a summary of the fourth quarter income statement. Reported total revenue in the fourth quarter was flat year-over-year at $3.9 billion with organic growth of 7.2%, offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translations and net disposition revenue in excess of acquisition revenue.Since most of our expenses are incurred in the local markets where our revenue is earned, foreign currency translation also reduced our operating expenses, which were flat versus last year. Reported operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 3.2%; and on a constant currency basis, it increased 8.4%. Moving down the income statement. Higher interest income again helped lower our net interest expense, which decreased by $18.5 million. Our tax rate of 26.5% was as expected. In 2023, despite the increasing interest rate environment, we currently expect interest expense to approximate 2022 levels and interest income to increase moderately in Q1 and Q2 of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 and approximate 2022 levels in the second half of 2023.Media, Communication, CompanyPhoto by Memento Media on UnsplashWe also currently expect our effective book income tax rate in 2023 to be approximately 27%. The increase relative to our 2022 rate is primarily due to the UK tax rate which is scheduled to increase in April of 2023. Overall, our Q4 '22 net income rose 3.3% on a reported basis. Combined with the reduction in shares year-over-year, diluted EPS rose 7.2%. Without the headwind from negative foreign currency translation, diluted EPS for the quarter increased 13.3%. For a review of the full year, please turn to Slide 4, where we show certain non-GAAP adjustments to make the periods more comparable. None of these adjustments are new this quarter. They were discussed earlier this year and last year. For the year-to-date 2022 period, operating expenses and income taxes were impacted by charges in the first quarter arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine.For the year-to-date 2021 period, operating expenses benefited from a gain on sale of a subsidiary and both interest expense and income tax expense reflect the impact from the early extinguishment of debt in 2021. Continuing on Slide 4, similar to the quarterly results we just discussed. The strength in the dollar this year also impacted our year-to-date results. Foreign currency translation reduced revenues by 4.8%. Operating profit on a non-GAAP adjusted basis of $2.2 billion was up 2.3%. And without the headwind from negative foreign currency translation, it increased 6.8%. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS of $6.93 rose 8.5%; or without the headwind from negative foreign currency translation, it increased 13.6%. Let's now go into some more detail on our results, beginning on Slide 5 with an analysis of the change in our revenue.As discussed, our organic growth was 7.2% for the quarter, and 9.4% year-to-date. The quarterly impact from foreign currency translation was negative 5.5%. It's worth noting that for financial reporting purposes, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of every country we operate in, except for Brazil when compared to Q4 of 2022. However, this impact was slightly less than it was in the third quarter. So it did move in the right direction. The impact of acquisition and disposition revenue was negative 1.4%, primarily reflecting the disposition of our businesses in Russia during the first quarter of 2022. Looking forward, foreign currency exchange rates stay where they were as of February 1, we estimate that the impact will reduce our revenue by approximately 3% in the first quarter and moderate for the remainder of 2023 to be approximately flat for the year.Based on deals completed to date, we expect the impact from net acquisitions and dispositions will result in a reduction of our revenue by approximately 1.5% in the first quarter, primarily resulting in the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022. Turning to Slide 6. For the quarter, we once again showed organic growth across all of our disciplines with the exception of execution and support as we expected. As you can see, performance in each of our other disciplines remained solid with double-digit organic growth in three of them. Advertising &amp; Media, our largest category, posted 6% organic growth in the quarter, led by strong performance in our Media businesses. Precision Marketing continued its strong performance, 11.6% organic growth as clients continue to turn to us for digital transformation, digital customer experience and data analytics services.Although this growth rate moderated a bit relative to the third quarter, we're excited about the outlook, and we'll continue to invest in this space. Commerce &amp; Brand Consulting was up 7.2% organically on the strength of our branding and design agencies. Experiential organic growth was a strong 17% where we saw more benefits than we expected from the FIFA World Cup and other year-end projects. Execution &amp; Support, which we expected would be choppy in the second half, had a decline of 2.8% against the comp of 5.2% growth in last year's fourth quarter. Public Relations grew a strong 12.7% organically in the quarter, keeping up a double-digit trend, reflecting continued client demand across many industries and geographies, and including increased revenue of approximately $10 million, resulting from increased election spending in the U.S. in the second half of the year.And Healthcare delivered solid organic growth of 6.4%. Turning to Slide 7 for revenue by region. We're pleased to see continued positive growth globally. In the U.S., our 5.6% quarterly organic growth was led by Advertising &amp; Media, Precision Marketing and Public Relations. International growth of 8.7% was also led by Advertising &amp; Media and Precision Marketing and also saw the strong contribution from Experiential that I mentioned earlier. Regionally, we saw some expected slowdown compared to the first half of the year in the UK and Europe, but their organic growth of 10% and 5%, respectively, is still quite healthy. Asia Pacific also improved, led by China and also driven by most of our other markets in the region. Looking at revenue by industry sector on Slide 8.Relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, the mix of our client portfolio was broadly stable. Categories that moved year-over-year included an increase in exposure to pharma and health and a decrease in exposure to technology. Let's now turn to Slide 9 and look at our operating expenses for the quarter. For your reference Slide 17 in the appendix presents this on a constant currency basis. Our total expenses were essentially flat at $3.2 billion due primarily to the weakening of almost all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Salary and related service costs decreased as we saw an increase related to organic revenue growth and additional headcount, offset by the effects of foreign currency translation. Third-party service costs increased due to an increase in organic revenue.Occupancy and other costs increased primarily due to some growth in general office expenses as our workforce returns to the office, partially offset by lower rents. On the topic of rent, you may have seen in January that we moved the Madison Avenue headquarters for TBWA to a location that houses other Omnicom agencies. It is an open, modern and collaborative space with an efficient design. This is another example of the rationalization of our rooftops, which we expect will continue in the future. SG&amp;A expenses were down year-over-year due to lower professional fees, lower marketing-related costs and reductions from the effects of foreign currency translations. Turning to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter operating profit was $643 million, a 3.2% increase from last year, net of a reduction of $32.3 million of the impact of foreign currency translations.Our operating profit margin reached 16.6% on total revenue compared to last year's margin of 16.1%. Please turn now to Slide 11 for our cash flow performance on a full year basis. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in operating capital. Free cash flow for the year was approximately $1.8 billion, flat compared to last year. Regarding our uses of cash, we used $581 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $80 million for dividends to non-controlling interest shareholders. Capital expenditures of $78 million were at normal levels. Acquisition spend, net of dispositions and other items was $330 million. And lastly, our net stock repurchases for the year were $594 million, at the high end of our expectations of $500 million to $600 million.In 2023, we expect that we will also repurchase shares within this historical range. Regarding the changes in our operating capital for the year, which resulted in a use of cash of approximately $840 million, the principal factors that caused this reduction included: a reduction in billings in 2022 resulting from certain client losses in 2021; disposition of our businesses in Russia, including cash for operations in Q1 of 2022; disposition of our specialty media business in 2021; impacts from increased client activity related to the reopening in China at the end of the fourth quarter; and timing differences compared to the prior year; and cash collections and cash payments at year-end. As we look forward, we expect change in operating capital to be a source of cash again for fiscal year 2023.Slide 12 is an overview of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. During the quarter, the impact of foreign exchange rates on our euro and sterling denominated debt caused the book value of our outstanding debt to decrease to $5.6 billion from $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. There were no changes in outstanding balances during the quarter and our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program, remains undrawn. Our cash and cash equivalents were $4.3 billion at year-end. The reduction relative to year-end 2021 is due primarily to the changes in operating capital that I just discussed as well as the effect of foreign exchange rate changes, which reduced our cash balance by $219 million for the year.Turning to Slide 13. Our operating capital discipline consistently drives above-average returns on both invested capital and equity. For 12 months ended December 31, 2022, we generated a solid return on invested capital of 28% and a strong return on equity of 40%. The strength of our business delivers attractive returns on a relative basis in both strong and weaker macroeconomic environments. In closing, as 2023 unfolds, we are prepared, as always, for an uncertain business environment. We have a strong track record of providing attractive returns through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing our business through challenging market conditions and we will do so while continuing to invest in our strategic future growth.Operator, please open the line questions and answers.

40,9e5d0b7d-5ad8-3b54-a584-6934861f07da,OMC,2023-02-10,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Omnicom (OMC) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005782.html,1675962005,STORY,['OMC'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Omnicom (OMC), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Omnicom currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if OMC is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this advertising company holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor OMC, shares are up 7.54% over the past week while the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry is up 4.67% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 9.3% compares favorably with the industry's 9.5% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Omnicom have increased 21.92% over the past quarter, and have gained 3.06% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 8% and -7.48%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to OMC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. OMC is currently averaging 1,634,970 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with OMC.Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost OMC's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.22 to $6.55 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that OMC is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Omnicom on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: salesforce.com inc. CRM, ServiceNow Inc. NOW, Okta Inc. OKTA, Unity Software Inc. U and Splunk Inc. SPLK.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Tech Stocks to Buy on the Dip to Gain from Sector ChurnWall Street witnessed a broad-based decline in 2022 with the technology sector suffering the most. Technology, which enabled Wall Street to get rid of the coronavirus-induced short bear market and formed the new bull market, suffered owing to overvaluation, a high-interest-rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed to combat 40-year high inflation.However, a very early sign of a rebound in the technology sector is clearly visible this year. Several measures of inflation for the last three months have indicated that peak inflation seems behind us. Consequently, the Fed has reduced the magnitude of interest rate hike from 75 basis points to 25 basis points.Sector Churn in Early 2023The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plummeted 33.1% year over year and 32.9% from its all-time high in 2022. On the other hand, of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and the tech-laden Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) are currently trading at a 13.6% and 21.3% discount, respectively, from their 52-week highs.Consequently, the technology sector is no longer overvalued. We are seeing early signs of market participants’ confidence returning to this sector. This trend is likely to get further momentum in 2023.Of the three major stock indexes — year to date — the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has rallied 13.8% while the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 have risen 2.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Year to date, the XLK and the XLC have gained 15.4% and 22.1%, respectively.Story continuesTechnology: Best Bet for the Long TermLast year’s meltdown of the technology sector was a temporary phenomenon. The fundamentals of this sector are rock solid. We must not forget that the growing demand for hi-tech products has been a catalyst for the sector in an otherwise tough environment. A series of breakthroughs in 5G wireless network, cloud computing, predictive analysis, Artificial Intelligence, self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet of Things, has bosted the overall space.The leading emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, Africa and some European countries are still way behind in using digital technology compared to the developed world. While mobile phone penetration is nearly 90% in these countries, a large number of people are still using phones with old features, since voice communication and not data serve most of their needs. Even those using smartphones, rarely utilize online digital features.However, the outbreak of coronavirus quickly changed the lifestyle and lookout of these people. The countries that are more digitized have been able to minimize their losses during the pandemic. These are major lessons for other countries.Even those who are less inclined toward digital technology and online platforms, either because they have to learn using smartphones or tablets or due to fear of data theft, are now feeling the massive advantage of online platforms.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) U.S.-based technology stocks with attractive valuations. The stocks have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revision in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It's time for Cut for Time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this. We've got two for you today, actually.Dan Loeb's Third Point is reportedly taking a stake in Salesforce. This is according to ""The Wall Street Journal."" This would be the fifth activist investor known to take a position in the software giant. It's been quite the year, everyone lobbing their activist campaign into Salesforce. Shares of CRM--BRIAN SOZZI: I've never seen this before. And I've covered activist investing for a very long time. I know I look young. But five activist investors to attack a company, a household name company like Salesforce is just mind-boggling.And I think at this stage in the game, I think Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, should take a page out of what Bob Iger did and come out blasting here. If he wants these folks to get off his back, he's going to have to come out aggressively, really aggressively and cut billions in dollars of costs, if they are in fact there, because this is now at the point where it's a dark cloud over the stock. And it is likely impacting how this company operates from day to day.JULIE HYMAN: And he hasn't taken the opportunity thus far to do this, right?BRIAN SOZZI: That has not happened.JULIE HYMAN: He has missed the opportunity to do so. The proxy period for this company opens on February 12. That's when they can start filing what they want to have happen, including potential board seats. So that's going to be the period to watch.BRIAN SOZZI: Now, Marc is open to good ideas. He wants to hear good things. He is a very collaborative person. I just think it would behoove him just to get this done, get these guys out of the stock, stop so we're not talking about this anymore and going back to talking about growth at Salesforce.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Speaking of which, what happened to our buzzer?[BUZZER]There it is.BRIAN SOZZI: All right.]"

The company expects to report its full results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 the afternoon of Tuesday, February 21, 2023.2022 Fourth Quarter Preliminary PreviewBased on its preliminary review, Flowserve anticipates fourth quarter 2022 revenues of approximately $1 billion, representing an increase of approximately 13 percent compared to the prior year. With solid margin performance, fourth quarter 2022 Reported and Adjusted operating income is anticipated between $100 to $110 million, producing operating margins above 10 percent.

(""Velan"") (TSX: VLN), a leading manufacturer of highly engineered industrial valves, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement (the ""Arrangement Agreement"") under which Flowserve will acquire Velan in an all cash transaction (the ""Transaction"") valued at approximately $245 million (C$329 million), including the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding Velan equity for approximately $209 million (C$281 million) and the assumption of approximately $36.3 million (C$48.9 million) in outstanding gross debt as of November 30, 2022. Flowserve will also assume Velan’s $31.4 million (C$42.2 million) of cash and cash equivalents, also as of November 30, 2022. The Transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2023.Founded in Montreal in 1950, Velan is a leading manufacturer of industrial valves with a strong presence in the nuclear, cryogenic and defense markets. Velan is a family-controlled business, with a team of 1,650 people and manufacturing facilities in nine countries. Through its fiscal third quarter ended November 30, 2022, Velan reported trailing twelve-month revenues of approximately $380 million with reported EBITDA of approximately $21 million. Upon completion of the Transaction, Velan will become part of Flowserve’s Flow Control Division (FCD) segment.Story continuesVelan adds significant value within Flowserve’s existing valves portfolio and further builds upon Flowserve’s existing assets through the addition of Velan’s premier brands, strong heritage and technical expertise in attractive and diverse end markets. The additional scale, footprint consolidation and procurement opportunities provided by the combination is expected to result in substantial synergies. Further, the Transaction is expected to increase Flowserve’s aftermarket potential, based on the large installed base of Velan products and the expansive network of Flowserve’s Quick Response Centers (QRCs.)In addition to revenue synergies created through a global aftermarket footprint, Flowserve expects to realize approximately $20 million (C$26 million) of run-rate cost synergies within two years after close. The Transaction is expected to be accretive to Flowserve’s adjusted EPS in the first full year following close. Including anticipated synergies, the economics imply an EBITDA multiple of less than 7x.""We are excited about the opportunity to add Velan and its talented team to the Flowserve family,"" said Scott Rowe, Flowserve’s President and Chief Executive Officer. ""With its strong positioning in the nuclear, cryogenic, industrial and defense markets and highly complementary product portfolio, the addition of Velan furthers our Diversification, Decarbonization and Digitization (3D) strategy. The Transaction also meets our disciplined financial criteria, bringing meaningful aftermarket revenue and synergy opportunities.""Velan’s Chairman of the Board and of its Special Committee, James Mannebach, commented, ""This agreement is the culmination of an extensive and robust review of strategic options to maximize shareholder value and reflects the incredible efforts of our team members to serve customers with a focus on innovation and excellence. The Transaction provides Velan shareholders an opportunity to realize an immediate and attractive premium for their shares and is recommended by the Board of Directors and Special Committee of Velan. We see a very bright future for Velan as part of Flowserve’s leading global flow control business, and we look forward to working closely with their team to quickly integrate and realize the significant benefits of this complementary combination.""Velan Holding Co.

The Transaction represents the best and highest proposal received by the Special Committee as part of its process.The C$13.00 purchase price per multiple voting and subordinate voting share represents a 119% premium to Velan’s 30-day volume-weighted average price per subordinate voting share on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and a 100% premium to the unaffected price of the subordinate voting shares on February 8, 2023. The cash consideration provides immediate liquidity and certainty of value to Velan shareholders.After receiving a unanimous recommendation from the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Velan, comprised solely of independent directors, and fairness opinions from BMO Capital Markets and Richter LLP, the Velan Board of Directors has unanimously determined (with Messrs. Ivan Velan, Peter Velan, Rob Velan and Tom Velan abstaining from voting thereon, due to their interest in Velan via Velan Holding) that the consideration to be received by Velan shareholders pursuant to the Transaction, is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, that the Transaction is in the best interests of Velan and recommends that shareholders vote in favor of the Transaction.ApprovalsThe Transaction is expected to proceed by way of a plan of arrangement by which Flowserve would acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Velan, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including applicable court and regulatory approvals and the approval of at least 66⅔% of the votes cast by Velan shareholders represented at a Special Meeting in person or represented by proxy as a single class, and a simple majority of the votes cast by the Velan shareholders, by class, after excluding votes from certain shareholders. The Transaction is not subject to any financing conditions. The Transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2023.Offer DetailsFurther details regarding the terms of the Transaction are set out in the Arrangement Agreement, which will be publicly filed in due course by Flowserve at www.sec.gov and Velan under its issuer profile at www.sedar.com.

Even new Weekly Jobless Claims and quarterly earnings report had virtually no effect on levels at this hour: the Dow is +230 points, the S&amp;P 500 is +50 and the Nasdaq is +130 points.Initial Jobless Claims for last week came in at the highest level since the first couple weeks of the year: 196K, following cycle lows at an unrevised 183K the previous week. That said, we remain toward the lower end of the 12-week cycle, which still averages over 200K new jobless claims going back to late November. Looking back to mid-summer last year, we saw this figure climb to around 260K new claims in a week. So we’re still well beneath that; question is: is that where we’re headed?Continuing Claims, reported a week in arrears from new claims, also bumped higher in this morning’s print: 1.688 million is higher than the 1.650 million reported the previous week, which stands roughly in the middle of the 12-week cycle. The lows we saw here were back in June of ’22, where we flirted temporarily with just 1.3 million long-term claims per week — an historically low number that takes us all the way back to when the Beatles were still together.PepsiCo PEP reported Q4 earnings figures which, as per usual, outperformed expectations (PepsiCo has not missed on earnings estimates in well over a decade): earnings of $1.67 per share surpassed the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and above the $1.53 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $28 billion beat expectations by +4.27%. The company’s top-line track record is exceedingly impressive, as well.The soft drinks and snacks giant has not yet taken part in the strong run-up of 2023 stock markets, -5% year to date ahead of the earnings report. Pre-market trading has cut that basically in half. The company entered its Q4 report carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a Value - Growth - Momentum grade of C.

At the same time, the prices that Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) pays for the natural gas it delivers to its customers have been rising this year, driven by higher demand and tighter supplies on the West Coast.Pacific Gas and Electric Company logo (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)While customers may see their energy bills rise, PG&amp;E does not control the market prices it pays for gas and electricity, nor does PG&amp;E mark up the cost of energy it purchases on behalf of its customers.PG&amp;E provides additional information about higher gas bills on its Currents website. The site also has information about the California Climate Credit. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) recently approved distributing the credit as soon as possible, instead of the annual April timeframe, to help offset higher than normal bills. For natural gas residential customers, the credit will be $52.78, and for electric residential customers, the credit will be $38.39. Customers who receive both services will receive a total credit of $91.17.Here are tools that customers can use now to manage winter bills:Make sure you're on the right rate plan: View your personalized Rate Plan Comparison to find the best rate plan for how your household uses energy.Keep bills predictable: Level out monthly payments and offset high seasonal bills with Budget Billing, a free tool that averages your annual energy costs to help manage monthly bills.Flexible payment arrangements: Extend your bill due date or make a payment arrangement. Access your online account for details.Customers struggling to pay their bills can learn more about the following programs:California Alternate Rates for Energy Program (CARE) saves 20% or more each month on energy bills for income-qualified customers.Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) Program (FERA) offers a monthly discount on electric bills for income-qualified customers with three or more people in the household.Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) offers up to $1,000 to pay eligible household energy costs.Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help (REACH) Program offers one-time financial assistance to qualified customers with past-due bills.Story continuesCustomers may qualify for several programs at once and can start applying or enrolling now.Here are simple steps customers can take to reduce energy costs this winter:Dial down your thermostat. You can save about 2% of your heating bill for each degree you lower the thermostat, heath permitting (if the turndown lasts a good part of the day or night). Turning down from 70 to 65 degrees, for example, saves 10%.Keep areas around vents open: Furniture and carpet can block heating vents, which makes heating systems work harder and prevents rooms from heating quickly.Wash in cold water: Save on water heating costs and wash only full loads of laundry in cold water.Use your window coverings: Open curtain and blinds to warm and light your home during the day and close them at night to help keep out the cold.Lower your water heater temperature: By setting your water heater temperature to 120 degrees Fahrenheit you can reduce the amount of energy it takes to produce and maintain hot water.For more easy tips for cold weather savings, visit www.pge.com/winter.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this publishing company whose flagship is The Wall Street Journal would post earnings of $0.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.12, delivering a surprise of -40%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.News Corp. , which belongs to the Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry, posted revenues of $2.52 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.50%.

Profits across News Corp’s portfolio of property websites, which includes Realtor.com in the US and Realestate.com.au in Australia, slumped by 28pc.Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp, said: “Obviously, a surge in interest rates and acute inflation had a tangible impact on all of our businesses.“But we believe these challenges are more ephemeral than eternal. Just as our company passed the stress-test of the pandemic with record profits, the initiatives now underway, including an expected 5 percent headcount reduction, or around 1,250 positions this calendar year, will create a robust platform for future growth.”The figures mark the first set of results since Mr Murdoch abandoned plans to reunite the two strands of his empire through a merger of News Corp and Fox Corporation.News Corp and Fox were split in 2013, with most of Fox’s entertainment assets being sold to Disney in a blockbuster $71bn deal in 2019.The media mogul floated the idea of a tie-up last year, but called off the plans in January following a backlash from investors.The Murdoch family’s attempt to merge the two businesses cost News Corp $6m over the period, reflecting the cost of advisors and convening a special committee to assess the deal.News Corp joins a growing list of major US businesses that have announced job cuts in recent weeks. Google, Facebook-owner Meta, Amazon and Salesforce have all announced thousands of job cuts as the economic outlook has darkened.]"

The layoffs will be made across all businesses and result in savings of at least $130 million on an annualized basis.The company said that in the third quarter it expects to see one-time costs related to the withdrawn Fox-News Corp proposal and its previously announced exploration of a sale of Move Inc, which operates the Realtor.com website, to CoStar Group.Shares of the company fell 1.4% in extended trading.Advertising revenue in the second quarter fell 10.6% to $464 million during the quarter.Revenue was $2.52 billion in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, while analysts on average expected $2.55 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Adjusted earnings per share were 14 cents, while analysts were expecting 19 cents.

66,6131a606-f93e-3836-9d6e-ec8806e01198,MRO,2023-02-10,DT Midstream (DTM) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dt-midstream-dtm-earnings-expected-150003807.html,1675954803,STORY,['MRO'],"[The market expects DT Midstream (DTM) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 16, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis natural gas pipeline operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.95 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.7%.Revenues are expected to be $238.07 million, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.27% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for DT Midstream?For DT Midstream, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DT Midstream will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that DT Midstream would post earnings of $0.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.90, delivering a surprise of +4.65%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.DT Midstream doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerMarathon Oil (MRO), another stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.87 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +13%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.75 billion, down 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Marathon Oil has been revised 17.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -9.35%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Oil will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Revenue from acquisitions was $39 million, and currency headwinds were $87 million. The Products and Systems Integration segment increased 21% due to growth in land mobile radio (LMR) and video security and access control (Video). The Software and Services segment grew 9% driven by growth in LMR services, Video and Command center.Operating margin - GAAP operating margin was 25.6% of sales, up from 23.7% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.4% of sales, up from 28.9% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin was primarily driven by higher sales in both segments and improved operating leverage in the Products and Systems Integration segment.Taxes - The GAAP effective tax rate was 11.0%, down from 22.4% in the year-ago quarter driven primarily by higher benefits in the current year related to a partial release of a valuation allowance recorded on the U.S. foreign tax credits carryforward and higher stock-based compensation. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.2%, compared to 22.3% in the year-ago quarter, driven by higher benefits from stock-based compensation in the current year.Cash flow - Operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, up $570 million compared to the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion, up $565 million compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase in both operating and free cash flow was driven by improvements in working capital and higher earnings.Capital allocation - During the quarter, the company paid $132 million in dividends, repurchased $87 million of its common stock and incurred $73 million in capital expenditures. Additionally, the company closed the acquisitions of Rave Mobile Safety and FutureCom Systems Group for $553 million and $30 million, net of cash acquired, respectively.OTHER SELECT FULL-YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTSRevenue - Full-year sales were $9.1 billion, up 12% driven by growth in North America and International. The Products and Systems Integration segment grew 14% primarily due to higher sales of LMR and Video. The Software and Services segment grew 8% driven by growth in Video, LMR services and Command center. The impact of unfavorable currency rates was $216 million and sales from acquisitions was $121 million.Operating margin - For the full year, GAAP operating margin was 18.2% of sales, compared to 20.4% for the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a fixed asset impairment charge of $147 million related to the exit from the Emergency Services Network (ESN) contract in the U.K. and higher stock based compensation in the current year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.0% of sales, up from 25.9% in the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs and expenses from acquisitions.Taxes - The 2022 GAAP effective tax rate was 9.8%, down from 19.5% in the prior year driven primarily by a discrete deferred tax benefit as a result of the taxable reorganization of our intellectual property in the current year, a benefit from a partial release of the valuation allowance recorded on the U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward and the benefit from higher stock based compensation in the current year. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.1%, down from 21.0% in the previous year, primarily driven by the benefit from higher stock based compensation in the current year.Cash flow - The company generated $1.8 billion in operating cash and free cash flow was $1.6 billion in both the current and prior years. Higher earnings generated in the current year were offset by an increase in working capital and higher incentive payments.Capital allocation - In 2022, the company paid $1.2 billion, net of cash acquired, for seven acquisitions, repurchased $836 million of its common stock at an average price of $225 per share and paid $530 million in dividends. The company also issued $600 million of long-term debt and repaid $275 million of outstanding long-term debt.Backlog - The company ended the year with record backlog of $14.3 billion, up $788 million from the prior year. Products and Systems Integrations segment backlog was up 22% or $894 million driven by record LMR product orders. Software and Services segment backlog was down 1% or $106 million, primarily driven by revenue recognition for the Airwave and ESN contracts, $367 million of unfavorable currency rates, and a reduction relating to the exit from the ESN contract, partially offset by growth in multi-year software and services contracts in North America.NOTABLE WINS &amp; ACHIEVEMENTS IN Q4Software and Services$56M P25 multi-year managed service extension of the Interexport contract for the Chilean National Law Enforcement Police$25M P25 software upgrade agreement renewal for a large U.S. customer$22M NG911 expansion and renewal for Greater Harris County, TX$21M system upgrade and multi-year services renewal for Lane County, OR$15M P25 and command center upgrade agreement extension order for Columbus, GA$15M license plate recognition camera system expansion order for the Illinois State PoliceProducts and Systems Integration$45M P25 APX NEXT devices order for the city of Houston, TX$39M P25 APX NEXT devices order for a large U.S. customer$30M P25 APX NEXT devices order for the city of Dallas, TX$21M add-on P25 APX NEXT devices order for a large U.S. customer$20M P25 APX NEXT devices and command center order for Kansas City, MO$19M P25 system order for a large international customer$3M fixed video order for Metra RailBUSINESS OUTLOOKFirst-quarter 2023 - The company expects revenue growth between 12% and 13% compared to the first quarter of 2022. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $2.02 to $2.07 per share. This assumes approximately $40 million in foreign exchange headwinds, approximately 172 million fully diluted shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.Full-year 2023 - The company expects revenue in the range of $9.65 billion to $9.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $11.10 to $11.22 per share. This assumes approximately $40 million in foreign exchange headwinds, approximately 172 million fully diluted shares and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23% to 24%.The company has not quantitatively reconciled its guidance for forward-looking non-GAAP measurements in this news release to their most comparable GAAP measurements because the company does not provide specific guidance for the various reconciling items as certain items that impact these measures have not occurred, are out of the company’s control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measurement is not available without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the company’s results.RECENT EVENTSCMA UPDATEIn October 2021, the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (the CMA) announced that it had opened a market investigation into the Mobile Radio Network for the Police and Emergency Services. This investigation affects Airwave, the company’s private mobile radio communications network that it acquired in 2016. Airwave provides mission-critical voice and data communications to public emergency service agencies in Great Britain. In October 2022, the CMA published a provisional decision with its findings regarding competition and proposed remedies. The company disagrees with the CMA’s provisional decision and will continue to work with the CMA to demonstrate the value of the Airwave network and pursue its legal avenues to protect Airwave’s contractual position.ESN MATTERSDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the company signed a mutual agreement with the Home Office for the company to exit the ESN contract early, inclusive of twelve months of transition services through the end of 2023. During the third quarter of 2022, the company determined that the future service potential of the ESN communications systems contract was limited, based on the company's intention to terminate the contract in advance of the contracted service term. The company thus recorded a fixed asset impairment loss of $147 million related to assets constructed and used in the deployment of the contract.MACROECONOMIC EVENTSDuring fiscal year 2022, the company operated under challenging market conditions, influenced by events such as those discussed below. For a more complete discussion of the risks the company encounters in its business, please refer to Part I. Item 1A. ""Risk Factors"" in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and Part II. Item 1A. ""Risk Factors"" in the company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2022.Russia-Ukraine ConflictDuring the first quarter of 2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the company suspended all sales, provision of services and shipments of its products to Russia and Belarus, which did not constitute a material portion of the company's business. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the company's net sales in Russia and Belarus were less than $25 million. However, throughout 2022, the company indirectly experienced impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict (as further described below). While the company does not anticipate that the current posture of the Russia-Ukraine conflict will materially and adversely affect its results of operations, the conflict is still ongoing and has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including increased volatility in capital and commodity markets, rapid changes to regulatory conditions (including the use of sanctions), supply chain and operational challenges for multinational corporations, inflationary pressures and an increased risk of cybersecurity incidents.COVID-19, Supply Chain Disruptions &amp; Inflationary Cost EnvironmentThroughout 2022, the company's supply chain was, and continues to be, impacted by global issues related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the inflationary cost environment, particularly with respect to materials in the semiconductor market, including part shortages, increased freight costs, diminished transportation capacity and labor constraints. This has resulted in disruptions in the company's supply chain, as well as difficulties and delays in procuring certain semiconductor components. Cost increases were driven by elevated lead times and increased material costs, in particular the need to purchase semiconductor components from alternative sources, including brokers. While the company continued to navigate supply chain constraints in 2022, the company anticipates the broader impact of inflationary pressures and increased material and supply chain costs and disruptions (including elevated costs to procure materials within the semiconductor market) to continue into 2023. However, the company expects global transportation costs to improve in 2023 as compared to 2022. The company is closely monitoring supply chain disruptions and continues to remain focused on improving its supplier network, engineering alternative designs and working to reduce supply shortages. The company also continues to actively manage its inventory in an effort to minimize supply chain disruptions and enable continuity of supply and services to its customers, and the company expects to maintain elevated levels of inventory until supply constraints have been remediated.In order to combat rising inflation in the U.S., the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times since the beginning of 2022. The increase in U.S. dollar interest rates and overall market conditions led to significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many other global currencies in 2022. The strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted cash generated from the company's foreign operations in 2022, driven by revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies. The company expects fluctuations in the value of U.S. dollar relative to other currencies to continue to impact its operating cash flows and net earnings throughout 2023.Although the macroeconomic environment continued to introduce challenges during 2022, the company is encouraged by customer demand for the company's products and services. Specifically, in the Software and Services segment, with the largely recurring nature of the business and its strong backlog position, the company expects that the impact to operating margin will be limited during 2023. While the company was encouraged by strong backlog and growth in the Products and Systems Integration segment throughout 2022, which the company expects to continue to grow during 2023, supply constraints continue to impact the company's business and the company expects demand for its products will continue to outpace its ability to obtain semiconductor component supply throughout 2023. Where appropriate, the company has taken pricing actions around its product and service offerings to mitigate exposure to inflationary pressures on its businesses and benefited from these adjustments during 2022. The company expects to further benefit from such adjustments throughout 2023. Further, demand continues to be supported with ongoing sources of government funding, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (""ARPA""), which is intended to provide economic stimulus. The company experienced the positive impact of the ARPA funding on its business and results of operations throughout 2022 and anticipate that the ARPA will continue to have a positive impact on the company's business in 2023.CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST Motorola Solutions will host its quarterly conference call beginning at 4 p.m. U.S. Central Standard Time (5 p.m. U.S. Eastern Standard Time) on Thursday, February 9. The conference call will be webcast live with audio and slides at www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. An archive of the webcast will be available for a limited period of time thereafter.CONSOLIDATED GAAP RESULTS (presented in millions, except per share data)A comparison of results from operations is as follows:Fourth QuarterFull Year2022202120222021Net sales$2,706$2,320$9,112$8,171Gross margin1,3511,1834,2294,040Operating earnings6925491,6611,667Amounts attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. common stockholdersNet earnings5894011,3631,245Diluted EPS from continuing operations$3.43$2.30$7.93$7.17Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding171.9174.2171.9173.6USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONIn addition to the results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP"") included in this news release, Motorola Solutions also has included non-GAAP measurements of results, including free cash flow, non-GAAP operating earnings, non-GAAP EPS, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate and organic revenue. The company has provided these non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period-to-period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to that of its competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate performance of its businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes these measurements enable it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of its core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, GAAP measurements.Reconciliations: Details and reconciliations of such non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this news release.Free cash flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The company believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing its performance and coverage ratios with other companies in the company's industries, although the company's measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure is also used as a component of incentive compensation.Organic Revenue: Organic revenue reflects net sales calculated under GAAP excluding net sales from acquired business owned for less than four full quarters. The company believes organic revenue provides useful information for evaluating the periodic growth of the business on a consistent basis and provides for a meaningful period-to-period comparison and analysis of trends in the business.Non-GAAP operating earnings, non-GAAP EPS and non-GAAP operating margin each excludes highlighted items, including share-based compensation expenses and intangible assets amortization expense, as follows:Highlighted items: The company has excluded the effects of highlighted items including, but not limited to, acquisition-related transaction fees, tangible and intangible asset impairments, reorganization of business charges, certain non-cash pension adjustments, legal settlements and other contingencies, gains and losses on investments and businesses, Hytera-related legal expenses, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt and the income tax effects of significant tax matters, from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements because the company believes that these historical items do not reflect expected future operating earnings or expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. For the purposes of management's internal analysis over operating performance, the company uses financial statements that exclude highlighted items, as these charges do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance.Hytera-Related Legal Expenses: On March 14, 2017, the company filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the ""Court"") against Hytera Communications Corporation Limited of Shenzhen, China; Hytera America, Inc.; and Hytera Communications America (West), Inc. (collectively, ""Hytera""), alleging trade secret theft and copyright infringement and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. On February 14, 2020, the company announced that a jury decided in the company's favor in its trade secret theft and copyright infringement case. In connection with this verdict, the jury awarded the company $345.8 million in compensatory damages and $418.8 million in punitive damages, for a total of $764.6 million. On December 17, 2020, the Court denied the company’s motion for a permanent injunction, finding instead that Hytera must pay the company a forward-looking reasonable royalty on products that use the company’s stolen trade secrets. As the parties were unable to agree on a reasonable royalty rate, the Court entered an order favorable to the company on December 15, 2021, and, consistent with the company's requests, set royalty rates for Hytera's sale of relevant products from July 1, 2019 forward. On July 5, 2022, the Court ordered that Hytera pay into a third-party escrow on July 31, 2022, the royalties owed to the company based on the sale of relevant products from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2022. Hytera failed to make the required royalty payment on July 31, 2022. On August 1, 2022, Hytera filed a motion to modify or stay the Court’s previous July 5, 2022 royalty order. On August 3, 2022, the company filed a motion seeking to hold Hytera in civil contempt for violating the royalty order by not making the required royalty payment in July. Hytera made quarterly royalty payments on October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023.In response to the Court's decision to award the company $764.6 million in compensatory and punitive damages, Hytera motioned for certain equitable relief, which the Court granted on January 8, 2021, reducing the $764.6 million judgment award to $543.7 million. That same day, the Court also granted the company’s motion for prejudgment interest. On August 10, 2021, the Court ruled that Hytera must pay the company $51.1 million in prejudgment interest and $2.6 million in costs. On March 25, 2021, the Court entered rulings favorable to the company with respect to several of the company's post-trial motions, including the company's motion for attorneys' fees and its motion to require Hytera to turn over certain assets in satisfaction of the company’s judgment award. On October 15, 2021, the Court granted the company’s request for $34.2 million in attorneys’ fees against Hytera. On September 29, 2021, the company filed two additional motions with the Court, requesting the Court to reconsider its order denying the company’s request for an injunction, and requesting that the Court enforce its ruling requiring Hytera to turn over certain assets in satisfaction of the company's judgment award, or, in the alternative, hold Hytera in contempt. On July 5, 2022, the Court denied both motions.On September 7, 2021, Hytera filed a notice of appeal of the Court’s judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (the ""Court of Appeals""). The Court of Appeals dismissed the notice of appeal on February 16, 2022 after determining that such appeal was premature. On August 2, 2022, after the Court denied the motions described on July 5, 2022, Hytera filed a renewed notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals. The company filed its cross-appeal on August 5, 2022. Hytera filed its appellate court brief on November 15, 2022. The company’s reply brief is due on February 13, 2023.Separate from the company's litigation with Hytera, on May 27, 2020, Hytera America, Inc. and Hytera Communications America (West), Inc. each filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California (the ""Bankruptcy Court""). The company filed motions in the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the bankruptcy proceedings in July 2020. On January 22, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an agreed order, allowing a partial sale of Hytera's U.S. assets in the bankruptcy proceedings. The proposed sale does not include Hytera inventory accused of including the company’s intellectual property. On February 11, 2022, the Court entered an order to confirm the liquidation plan for the two Hytera entities and the distributions were made on February 25, 2022 to the creditors, including $13 million to the company. On December 22, 2022, an additional distribution of $2 million was made to the company as well as an assignment of various delinquent accounts receivable of the bankrupt Hytera entities. The gains for the two monetary distributions were recorded to Other charges (income) in the company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.Management typically considers legal expenses associated with defending the company's intellectual property as ""normal and recurring"" and accordingly, Hytera-related legal expenses were included in both the company's GAAP and non-GAAP operating income for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The company anticipates further expenses associated with Hytera-related litigation; however, as of 2020, the company believes that these expenses are no longer a part of the ""normal and recurring"" legal expenses incurred to operate its business. In addition, as any contingent or actual gains associated with the Hytera litigation are recognized, they will be similarly excluded from the company's non-GAAP operating income, consistent with the company's treatment of the approximately $15 million of proceeds realized in 2022. The company believes after the jury award, the presentation of excluding both Hytera-related legal expenses and gains related to awards better aligns with how management evaluates the company's ongoing underlying business performance.Share-based compensation expenses: The company has excluded share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the company’s employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding share-based compensation expense primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Share-based compensation expense will recur in future periods.Intangible assets amortization expense: The company has excluded intangible assets amortization expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net earnings measurements, primarily because it represents a non-cash expense and because the company evaluates its performance excluding intangible assets amortization expense. Amortization of intangible assets is consistent in amount and frequency but is significantly affected by the timing and size of the company’s acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to the company’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the company’s future period revenues as well. Intangible assets amortization expense will recur in future periods.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis news release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable federal securities law.

MPWR reported healthy fourth-quarter 2022 results, with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line meeting the same. The Kirkland, Washington-based company reported higher revenues year over year due to persistently strong demand in most of its business categories.

Despite higher operating expenditures and greater income tax expenses, a solid top-line performance ensured net income improvement.Non-GAAP net income was $154 million or $3.17 per share compared with $ 102.1 million or $2.12 per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line surpassed Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.For 2022, net income stands at $437.7 million or $9.05 per share compared with $242 million or $5.05 per share in 2021.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMonolithic Power Systems, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. Quote RevenuesQuarterly revenues for Monolithic Power increased to $460 million, up 36.7% from $336.5 million in the year-ago period. The top line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. All of the company's segments experienced strong growth during the fourth quarter, with the exception of the Consumer business, which had little impact on top-line performance.For 2022, the company experienced a 48.5% top-line expansion, with net sales increasing to $1,794.1 million from $1,207.8 million in 2021.In the fourth quarter, Storage and Computing revenues rose to $120.8 million, up 55% from the prior-year quarter’s figure of $78 million. The performance was driven by an increase in sales of storage applications and enterprise notebook..Communication revenue grew 40.1% to $64.3 million from $45.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The upside was driven by sales growth of 5G and satellite communications infrastructure applications.During the fourth quarter, Enterprise Data witnessed a staggering growth of 69% year over year. Revenues rose to $68.4 million from $40.5 million from the year-ago quarter’s levels.Top line expansion is due to greater sales of power management solutions for cloud-based CPU and GPU server applications.In the December quarter, revenues from the Automotive segment were up by a solid 72.8% year over year as the top line increased to $97.4 million compared with $56.4 million in the prior-year quarter.

In the fourth quarter, Lighting Control revenues increased to $27.5 million from $16.8 million in the previous year.Story continuesOther DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin expanded 60 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter’s level to 58.5%. This is primarily caused by a change in the sales mix that favors high-value greenfield products and operational efficiencies, which more than balance greater product input costs.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $94.8 million, up from $83 million in the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP operating income rose 70.7% year over year to $174.1 million.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityAs of Dec 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $288.6 million and $73.4 million in long-term liabilities compared with respective tallies of $189.3 million and $67.2 million in 2021.OutlookMPWR remain cautious about near-term business conditions as its Q4 inventory is above target levels.

The news seemed to have struck the right chords with investors as the firm’s share price appeared to rise in the pre-market trading.Based on the closing price of $35.14 on Feb 8, 2023, the proposed dividend affirms a yield of 3.2%. A steady dividend payout is part of Corning’s long-term strategy to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders. Additionally, healthy dividend increases at periodic intervals have been one of its key strengths.A few days earlier, Corning reported healthy fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein both the bottom line and top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It is benefiting from improved demand and commercialization of its innovations. Its capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to diverse industries. Multiple factors should drive Corning’s fiber optic solutions business over the next several years, primarily the increasing use of mobile devices that require efficient data transfer and efficient networking systems. Supporting this trend is the proliferation of clouds, resulting in increased storage and even computing on a virtual plane.Since both consumers and enterprises are using the network more, there is tremendous demand for quality networking. Also, data consumption patterns are changing. For instance, there is a growing propensity to consume video content, thus creating the need for faster data transfer. Since optical networks are more efficient and most of the existing networks are copper-based, the demand for optical solutions is particularly strong. Corning has several products focused on the datacenter with a portfolio consisting of optical fiber, hardware, cable and connectors that helps it to create optical solutions to meet evolving customer needs.5G, broadband and cloud computing continue to drive strong growth across the Optical Communications segment. Corning recently introduced high-performance cellular solutions to help network operators bring reliable 5G connection indoors with small-cell radio nodes that are easy to install and cost-effective. The in-building cellular products are part of Corning’s Everon Network Solutions — a suite of optical network components for enterprise deployment.In Specialty Materials, Corning is witnessing significant demand for its premium cover materials and advanced optics products, driven by strength in the IT, mobile device and semiconductor markets. It is a leading innovator in the glass substrate industry. The company has been developing formulations that are not only suitable for imparting superior picture quality but also taking care of their effects on the environment.Corning’s generation 10 substrates use the proprietary EAGLE XG formulation, which serves both these purposes. It was the first glass substrate developer with the generation 10 capability. A higher-generation substrate is a larger-sized substrate, which enables panel makers to reduce manufacturing costs since more panels can be built from each substrate. Corning’s capability positions it to better serve the secular increase in demand for LCD panels. The company’s fusion technology reduces glass thickness, enabling panel manufacturers to do away with thinning costs that are usually necessary for making slimmer, lighter and more power-efficient consumer devices. Also, the company’s Iris glass presents a significant growth opportunity.All these positives and sound financial management probably led to the quarterly dividend hike.Corning currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Signet (SIG) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 5.1% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this jewelry company well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. SIG meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 29.2% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for SIG is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 2.17. This indicates that the stock moves 117% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that SIG has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped SIG earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, SIG is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. SIG is currently trading at 0.44 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 44 cents for each dollar of sales.So, SIG appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to SIG, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

(NASDAQ:WBA) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wouldnt-too-quick-buy-walgreens-101340488.html,1676024020.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Walgreens Boots Alliance investors that purchase the stock on or after the 15th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.48 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.92 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Walgreens Boots Alliance has a trailing yield of approximately 5.4% on its current stock price of $35.81. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Walgreens Boots Alliance paid a dividend last year despite being unprofitable. This might be a one-off event, but it's not a sustainable state of affairs in the long run. Given that the company reported a loss last year, we now need to see if it generated enough free cash flow to fund the dividend. If Walgreens Boots Alliance didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. Over the past year it paid out 118% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is uncomfortably high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Walgreens Boots Alliance was unprofitable last year and, unfortunately, the general trend suggests its earnings have been in decline over the last five years, making us wonder if the dividend is sustainable at all.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Walgreens Boots Alliance has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.9% a year on average.We update our analysis on Walgreens Boots Alliance every 24 hours, so you can always get the latest insights on its financial health, here.To Sum It UpIs Walgreens Boots Alliance an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We're a bit uncomfortable with it paying a dividend while being loss-making, especially given that the dividend was not well covered by free cash flow. It's not that we think Walgreens Boots Alliance is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.So if you're still interested in Walgreens Boots Alliance despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. Be aware that Walgreens Boots Alliance is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

82,9c1cff68-b13a-32fb-8436-0e21126c55ef,WBA,2023-02-10,3 Top Dividend Aristocrats for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-dividend-aristocrats-2023-200709279.html,1675714029.0,STORY,"['WBA', 'ESS', 'VFC']","[For investors looking for reliable dividend growth stocks through all sorts of economic environments, the Dividend Aristocrats are a great place to look.That is because Dividend Aristocrats have grown their dividends for at least 25 years in a row, including through the economic recessions and other black swan events (such as the Covid-19 outbreak) that have taken place over that period. These three Dividend Aristocrats offer some of the most attractive current dividend yields and total return potential for 2023.With the economy seemingly on the verge of a downturn, it is increasingly important to invest in resilient business models. With Dividend Aristocrat stocks like the three discussed in this article, investors can gain exposure to proven dividend growth machines. These picks have continued to grow their dividends through thick and thin for at least a quarter of a century.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is rapidly closing in on Dividend King (a 50+ year dividend per share growth streak) status with 46 years of consecutive dividend per share growth.It has sustained this tremendous level of consistency thanks to its defensive pharmacy business model. It has built a very strong brand, economies of scale and a strategically located empire of neighborhood pharmacies that also serve as convenience stores and general healthcare centers.Walgreens is the United States’ and Europe’s largest retail pharmacy. Today, it has over 315,000 employees in its more than 13,000 stores across three continents.While fears have risen due to the rise of e-commerce, including Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) entrance into the pharmacy industry, WBA continues to generate very strong results with earnings per share (EPS) exceeding analyst consensus estimates for 10 quarters in a row. Over the past 10 years, WBA has grown its EPS at a 6.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) alongside paying out a substantial dividend.Story continuesMoving forward, we expect 4% annualized EPS growth through 2028 due to a combination of growth initiatives (such as new store construction and acquisitions), margin expansion efforts (cutting costs and complementing digital offerings by adding additional health and wellness offerings to the retail pharmacy experience to obtain greater leverage from the existing portfolio), and share repurchases. The company is also expected to grow its current 5.3% yielding dividend at a 4% CAGR over the next half-decade.WBA generated very stable EPS during the last recession. And we expect it to generate a similar performance in the event that we experience a recession in the coming years. This is because convenience stores and community pharmacies generally provide essential products and services. They remain in high demand regardless of people’s financial circumstances.V.F. Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comV.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a leading global apparel, footwear and accessories company that owns a wide variety of brands. It has increased its dividend for 50 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King as well as a Dividend Aristocrat.While the business is suffering at the moment due to a bad combination of inflation increasing its input costs and oversupply at its retailers putting pressure on its pricing power, the company continues to churn out annual dividend growth and its balance sheet remains in solid shape.In fiscal 2022, VFC generated very impressive results. The company reported $3.18 in EPS, covering its $1.97 per-share dividend by 1.6 times. However, in fiscal 2023, the company is expected to see its EPS plummet to $2 per share due to industry headwinds. Nevertheless, even that weak result will still cover its 2022 dividend level. It even provides some wiggle room to raise it further to keep its dividend growth streak going. Furthermore, its forward dividend yield now stands at 6.8%. This means that it does not need to generate much dividend growth to provide an attractive total return profile.Moreover, VFC’s long-term growth profile remains promising, with multiple avenues available to the company. These include acquisitions (which the company has developed a strong track record of executing and integrating), growing its core brands with renewed investments and e-commerce initiatives such as direct-to-consumer.Essex Property Trust (ESS)tiny house figures atop letter blocks spelling out REIT, representing reits to buy. stock predictions. undervalued reitsSource: ShutterstockEssex Property Trust (NYSE:ESS) has grown its dividend for 28 consecutive years, making it a fairly recent entry to the Dividend Aristocrats club. That said, the real estate investment trust (REIT) appears well-positioned to grow its dividend per share every year for many years to come. It has grown its dividend per share every year since going public and continues to have attractive long-term growth prospects.It invests primarily in West Coast multifamily residential apartment communities through the development, redevelopment, management, acquisition and sale of these properties. Its portfolio currently includes over 60,000 apartments in hundreds of communities. West Coast properties are competitively advantaged as they exist in supply-constrained geographies with strong economic fundamentals supported by the technology sector’s significant presence in those markets.Moving forward, we expect ESS to continue generating high rates of FFO per share growth. This is due to continued strong job growth in the technology sector along with limited new supply. As a result, ESS should be able to sustain strong rental rate hikes for years to come. Furthermore, it has proven to be a very effective allocator of capital by developing and redeveloping properties and then leasing them out or selling them for very attractive rates of return.Another reason to be bullish on ESS as a long-term dividend growth machine is the fact that it has proven to be quite resistant to recessions. Its FFO per share increased during the last recession, from $5.57 in 2007 to $6.14 in 2008 and then $6.74 in 2009. This is because it offers a basic necessity in markets where there is little to no excess supply of housing. As a result, its tenants will pay their rent even if it means giving up other consumer items.With a 4% dividend yield, an expected 5.3% FFO per share CAGR and 5.4% dividend per share CAGR over the next half-decade, ESS is an attractive risk-adjusted dividend growth stock at this point in the economic cycle.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

And yet for those who handed in their notice during the so-called 'Great Resignation' of 2021, many have seen little benefit for the upheaval.Now dubbed the 'Great Regret', analysis carried out by payroll and HR experts Paychex found that 80% of people who quit their roles in search of greener pastures regretted the move.Both job openings and the number of individuals quitting reached record highs during the pandemic, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, counting 4.5 million quitters in November 2021, and job openings reaching more than 11 million a month later.Of course, not all those who left their roles did so as part of the 'Great Resignation', as many were buffeted by pandemic factors which left them without choice.Yet for those who did jump ship for better pay and work-life balance, the vast majority admitted they still want their old roles back.Comparing generations, Gen Z are the most likely to regret moving roles.Those who switched industries are also 25% more likely to hanker for their previous sectors than those who stayed within their trades.Andrew Crapuchettes, CEO of Idaho-based recruitment agency Red Balloon, said: “In the Great Resignation employers were throwing huge sign-up bonuses and other wads of cash at job switchers. ‘The Great Regret’ is a lesson for jobseekers to do better advance scouting before they jump ship.""We’re seeing more and more job seekers prioritizing work-life balance and positive workplace culture above higher compensation. People want to be happy in their work, and that old adage that ‘money doesn’t buy happiness’ is reflected in this survey.”It comes after a Harris Poll—which surveyed more than 2,000 jobseekers—discovered that candidates are also finding it more difficult to secure a new job.Paychex's sample suggests a job search took an average of three to six months—Harris Poll found 60% of seekers say the search has dragged on for over six months, and many say they’ve applied to more than 50 roles.Story continuesMore than 70% of them also said it has been harder than they’d hoped to lock down a good role.Job-hoppers miss their old friendsThe most common reason job-hoppers gave for wanting a return to their former employers was that they missed their old colleagues, with almost a third of respondents saying they missed their former teams.This was followed by a range of monetary motivations: 27% said they missed their old salary, 23% valued their old bonus scheme, a further 23% said they missed their health insurance.Other reasons include free lunches, work-life balance, employee discounts and flexible and remote-work options.Chris Poole, UK managing director for global recruitment firm Robert Walters, said the best way to leave the door open with former employers is to put in the work until the very last day.He explains: ""As the saying goes in boxing: 'You’re only as good as your last fight.' I believe this to be true in work: 'You’re only as good as your last few months.' Don’t undo years of hard work and rapport building by taking your foot off the pedal just because you are leaving.""How to avoid job-hop regretFor employees and employers alike the advice is simple: bear motivation in mind.Red Balloon boss Crapuchettes said the data outlines that jobseekers who are just ""chasing a bigger paycheck"" often come away unfulfilled.Recruiters are also wising up to which candidates will be off again once a bigger salary is on the table.He added: ""If the candidate's got an early obsession with pay then that's a red flag. Asking about a salary range so they know if they can pay the bills is appropriate but if they're more concerned with the pay than the good work they can do that should be a concern.""A pretty easy tell is when you ask them: 'What's the biggest mistake you made in your last role?' If they say they never made any then that's a good sign that they're not going to be right.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeThe 5 most common mistakes lottery winners makeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $400,000 home]"

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). ADM is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 12.43 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 14.43. Over the last 12 months, ADM's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.93 and as low as 11.29, with a median of 14.36.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. ADM has a P/S ratio of 0.44. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.02.Finally, we should also recognize that ADM has a P/CF ratio of 8.53. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 8.82. ADM's P/CF has been as high as 14.28 and as low as 8.49, with a median of 10.60, all within the past year.Story continuesThese figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Archer Daniels Midland is likely being undervalued right now.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, check out 5 Most Valuable Hotel Companies In The World. Hotel and lodging industry revenue has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2022 was expected to end with $188 billion in revenue, an increase of 11% compared to 2019. However, adjusted for inflation, revenue per available room is not projected to exceed pre-pandemic levels until 2025. Hospitality companies who provide liquor and live entertainment might have to allocate 5% to 20% more budget for insurance in 2023, and establishments with facilities such as spa services will see rate increases as well. Hospitality industry profit margins will deteriorate in 2023 due to supply chain constraints, inflation, and higher wages pressuring profit margins. Based on strength in Q1 2022, ongoing halts in construction, greater inflation, and positive employment data, CBRE lifted its forecast of hotel performance for 2022 and beyond. CBRE said it anticipates complete rebound in average daily rate in 2022 and in demand and revenue per available room in 2023. Regardless of COVID-19 challenges, RevPAR in Q1 2022 came in at $72.20, above 61% from the prior year quarter. RevPAR growth was fueled by a 39% raise in ADR and 16% higher occupancy. Rachael Rothman, CBRE’s head of hotel research &amp; data analytics, said on May 31, 2022: “To date, there has been no sign that the more than 50 percent increase in gas prices and the stock market’s hovering near bear-market territory are dampening hotel demand. However, in the past, a steep decline in the S&amp;P 500 and high gas prices have often caused RevPAR growth to decline, which raises the specter of a pullback in RevPAR later this year. Despite this possibility, our outlook remains that the market will continue to recover.”The RevPAR growth in 2023 will result from equal parts of occupancy and average daily rate increases, which are expected to climb 4.2% during the year. The inventory of high-priced hotels is anticipated to escalate 2.1% in 2023, higher than the supply growth rates of 0.1% for lower and 2% for mid-priced hotels. Story continuesTo benefit from the lucrative hotel industry, investors can pick up stocks of some of the most valuable hotel companies like Marriott International, Inc.

While leisure rates dropped a little in the seasonally slower back-to-school period, this decline was expected and was more than offset by increases in business transient and group bookings. Robust rates across the industry are leading to higher margins, including for Hyatt. Hyatt is using the increased cash flow to buy-in its shares, indicating that it sees value in the stock.”9.

Airline and travel reservations and hotel management have not been happy places to be in the past year, although it is worth noting nowhere near as bad as investing in actual airlines or hotels. InterContinental’s share price fall of -9.9% compares with a drop of -35.1% for the Dow Jones US Hotel and Lodging REIT Index. This illustrates the virtues of InterContinental’s business model in contrast to the industry it serve.However, whilst they face a difficult situation, we are pleased that management has spent its time and effort managing liquidity and costs in an effort to ensure that they survive these events rather than pointlessly speculating about the likely timescale and course of recovery. We believe that they should not only survive but also strengthen their competitive position.”8. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc.

(NASDAQ:HST) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Shares of Host Hotels (HST) were also sold during the 3rd quarter for similar reasons as Cogent given a degradation in the prospect of a return in group leisure and business travel. The capital was similarly redeployed.”7. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM)Market Capitalization as of February 8: $15.837 billionMGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) was incorporated in 1986 and is based in Las Vegas, Nevada.

While Southwest cited weather impacts, the union singled out poor preparation and a failure to modernize technology.Democratic Senator Jacky Rosen called it an ""unmitigated disaster"" that had a ""devastating impact on families.""Ted Cruz, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, called the cancellation of more than 16,000 flights ""an epic screwup"" but said he was confident Southwest executives ""are committed to doing everything possible to prevent its recurrence.""Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson told reporters that the airline has already paid hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation and reimbursements for expenses and will cut 2022 bonuses to executives when they are awarded in March.""Executive bonuses for 2022 will be reduced because of this,"" he said.Watterson said it has received about 284,000 cases from passengers impacted by meltdown and reimbursed more than 273,000 -- leaving 10,782. He said those still under review had been submitted more recently.""We reimbursed tire chains, strollers, car seats, pet sitting, but things we didn't reimburse were things like $7,000 shopping sprees at luxury stores or chartering a private jet,"" Watterson said, adding that 96% of claims have been completed.Story continuesWatterson said that any passenger claim that was well documented and under $4,000 could be paid on the spot, while higher requests went to a supervisor.He acknowledged that the airline made mistakes and that technology issues were a factor. He said the carrier is introducing an updated crew scheduling system on Friday to address a specific failure during the meltdown.""Let me be clear: we messed up."" After detailing what went wrong, he added that ""none of this is an excuse."" He admitted: ""There were technology issues during the disruption -- we don't dispute that.""Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said, ""We're always going to have these weather events and some of us believe they're going to become more severe. But what we want is to have a system that is ready to address that.""Cantwell said Southwest Chief Executive Officer Bob Jordan, who had been invited to the hearing, ""didn't want to show up."" Southwest said the hearing conflicted with other commitments, including an employee rally in Baltimore on Wednesday.The meltdown caused the cancellation of almost 17,000 flights and is estimated to have cost the airline more than $1 billion. It has also prompted a lawsuit from shareholders and a Department of Transportation investigation.The Dallas-based airline attributed the breakdown in service to a ""historic"" winter storm, both in size and scale, that caused frozen jet bridges and icy aircraft engines.But Southwest's pilot union, which is in contract negotiations with the airline, blamed the company and its leadership for a ""failure"" to modernize crew management processes and technology and to prepare for the storm.Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), said that the union has been sounding the alarm about the carrier's crew scheduling technology and ""outdated"" operational processes for years.""Unfortunately, those warnings were summarily ignored,"" he said.The debacle has put Jordan in the eye of a storm as he faces pressure to restore the airline's credibility and regain the trust of customers just one year after he took the helm. Jordan has apologized and taken responsibility for the troubles, vowing to prevent a repeat.Murray said that while Jordan inherited a ""massive, complex operation held together by duct tape and baling wire,"" he must show through actions that the company is serious about change.

PM posted fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and came ahead of their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.    The company will report results based on its new regional structure (unveiled in November 2022) from the first quarter of 2023. This includes four regions instead of six, which is likely to take the company forward toward its goal of becoming a majority smoke-free business (in terms of net revenues) by 2025.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.39, which increased 1.5% year over year.

QuoteNet revenues of $8,152 million increased by 7.5% on an organic basis. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,480 million. The year-over-year upside was backed by an improved volume/mix and higher pricing variance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing).  Excluding Ukraine and Russia, net revenues grew 7.9% on an organic basis.During the quarter, net revenues from combustible products were up 1.3% to $5,214 million (on an organic basis). Revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 23% to $2,866 million. Net revenues from the Wellness and Healthcare segment came in at $72 million in the fourth quarter, down 18.8% on an organic basis.During the quarter, net revenues from smoke-free products formed 36% of the company’s total revenues.

The improved volume/mix and pricing variance were somewhat negated by increased manufacturing costs (mainly due to escalated logistics costs and other inflationary impacts, partly countered by productivity) and elevated marketing, administration and research costs.Story continuesRegion-Wise PerformanceNet revenues in the European Union increased by 11.2% on an organic basis to $2,890 million. This was backed by an improved volume/mix, partly negated by adverse pricing (stemming from reduced HTU net pricing). Total shipment volumes rose 3.1% to 46,810 million units.In Eastern Europe, net revenues increased by 5.9% organically to $992 million on improved pricing variance, somewhat negated by an adverse volume/mix. Total shipment volumes fell by 6% to 26,297 million units.In the Middle East &amp; Africa, net revenues jumped 3.4% to $924 million due to a positive volume/mix. Total shipment volumes in the region grew 4.9% to 37,142 million units.Revenues in South &amp; Southeast Asia advanced 9.4% on an organic basis to $1,100 million.

Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match on Nov 11, 2022. During this period, revenues from the segment came in at $316 million.Other UpdatesOn Jan 30, 2023, Philip Morris unveiled a long-term partnership with KT&amp;G to continue commercializing the innovative smoke-free devices and consumables of the latter on a unique, worldwide basis (excluding South Korea). The deal covers 15 years and is likely to enhance Philip Morris’ smoke-free product portfolio.Philip Morris ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3,207 million. It had long-term debt of $34,875 million and a shareholders’ deficit of $6,311 million as of Dec 31, 2022.Management expects operating cash flow of $10-$11 billion in 2023, with the capital expenditure likely to be around $1.3 billion. The adjusted effective tax rate is envisioned in the 20.5-21.5% band. The company stated that it would not make share repurchases in 2023.Update on the Ukraine WarPhilip Morris announced the temporary suspension of its operations in Ukraine, including its factory in Kharkiv, on Feb 25, 2022. In the second quarter, the company resumed some retail activities per safety. However, production at the company's factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. For Russia, PM announced (in March 2022) concrete steps to suspend planned investments and scale down manufacturing operations in the country.GuidanceManagement expects a top-and-bottom-line recovery in 2023, which is likely to be more weighted toward the second half. Management expects certain margin pressures in the first half. Management’s 2023 guidance includes the full contribution from its operations in Russia and Ukraine.  The total international industry volume growth is estimated in the range of 1-2%, excluding China and the United States. The total cigarette and HTU shipment volume growth is likely to come in the range of around flat to an increase of 1%. HTU shipment volumes are envisioned between 125 and 130 billion units.For 2023, PM expects net revenues to increase by nearly 7-8.5% on an organic basis. The adjusted operating margin growth on an organic basis is likely to decline 50-150 basis points.Management expects net revenues of about $300 million for the Wellness and Healthcare segment for the full year. It also expects a robust performance from Swedish Match’s existing operations.The company expects increased net interest costs of around $200 million from 2022. For the first quarter, PM expects EPS in the band of $1.28-$1.33, including a currency headwind of 10 cents per share. This reflects HTU shipment volumes of about 26-28 billion units, organic top-line growth in the low single digits and lower margins.Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have rallied 8.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 4.9%.Other Consumer Staple Stocks Worth a LookSome other top-ranked consumer staple stocks are Conagra Brands CAG, Lamb Weston LW and Post Holdings POST.Conagra, a consumer-packaged goods food company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Windbigler, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations. Brad, please go ahead.Brad Windbigler: Thank you. On today's call, we will discuss the company's fourth quarter 2022 results, our financial outlook for 2023, and then we will take your questions. The slides accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release. On our call today is our CEO, Devin McGranahan; and our CFO, Matt Cagwin. Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2021 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward- looking statements.During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles. We have reconciled those items and the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release attached to our Form 8-K as well as on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Devin McGranahan.Devin McGranahan: Good afternoon, and welcome to Western Union's fourth quarter 2022 financial results conference call. Our reported revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, and excluding contributions from Business Solutions, decreased 6% on a constant currency basis. This growth reflects a negative impact of 3 percentage points from the suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus continued softness in our retail business as well as our new branded digital marketing strategy, which includes promotional pricing. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.32 in the quarter compared with $0.64 in the prior year period, which included a contribution of $0.08 from Business Solutions and $0.06 from operations in Russia and Belarus.Story continuesThe decrease in adjusted EPS was driven lower by lower operating profit and a $0.05 negative currency impact and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by lower share count. We continue to focus on maximizing cash flow and on returning capital to our shareholders. In 2022, we returned over $700 million to the shareholders, including $175 million of share buyback in the fourth quarter. Matt will further discuss our financial results in more detail and provide an update on our 2023 financial outlook. On the macro front, 2022 is a challenging year for many businesses with interest rates rising to the highest levels in over a decade and global inflation at the highest point in multiple decades. Despite that backdrop, our customers continued to show their resilience with constant currency principal per transaction up 4% in the fourth quarter and the full year.The IMF updated their global growth forecast last week. They now expect GDP growth of 2.9% in 2023, which will be down from 3.4% in 2022. We have come to believe that remittance volume closely tracks with global GDP growth. As such, global remittance volume continues to remain strong, according to the World Bank's most recent migration and development brief, which was published in November. They estimated that global remittance flows to the low and middle income countries grew at 5% in '22 and project a further 2% growth in 2023. We continue to monitor macroeconomic variables that could influence our business, but our expectation is that the backdrop for 2023 will remain similar to what we have experienced in 2022, and we have included these assumptions in our 2023 outlook.Last October, we launched Evolve 2025 strategy to return Western Union to growth by becoming the market leader in providing accessible financial services to the aspiring populations of the world. To achieve this goal, we have been working to revitalize our core retail and digital remittance businesses in launch new products and services to expand our value proposition to our 120 million plus customers around the world. In August, we outlined our plan to accelerate investment in the back half of the year. We achieved this goal with increased investment in our technology platforms and in our digital marketing. These investments are focused on building core new technology to better enable world-class customer and agent experiences. As we highlighted yesterday, improving customer retention is an important driver of returning Western Union to positive growth.We are laser-focused on creating world-class experiences across our channels and products that will make it easier for customers to want to transact with us the first time and every time after. While our investment levels were heavier in the fourth quarter than I would expect on an ongoing basis, we recognized that in order to compete with many of our digital-first competitors, we need comparable customer experiences. And we'll want to continue to iterate and innovate every step of the customer journey. A few notable examples of investments in the fourth quarter include: First, in our digital bank, in February of 2022, we launched a digital bank in Germany and Romania with the goal of creating a digital wallet-based payment platform. As we evolve our model from a transaction-based relationship to an account-based relationship, we expect to see increased customer engagement through more frequent interactions and ultimately improve customer retention.We believe an account-based model will provide us with a better platform also for the expansion of new products and services. In Q3, we expanded our digital bank offering to Poland, and in Q4, we added Italy. By ending send-and-receive country pairs, we are experimenting with how this approach can maximize the benefits of our 2-sided network. The project is progressing. And the countries we have now launched, we have a total of approximately 150,000 onboarded customers. Our goal for 2023 is to expand our digital wallet and financial ecosystem to a number of additional markets. And in the fourth quarter, we made investments to enable us to launch our digital wallet in 2 additional European countries as well as our first 2 launches outside of Europe, including the United States, the largest remittance end market in the world; and Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America.In addition to our digital bank, in the quarter, we also still continued the development of our new retail point-of- sale system. We believe this new POS will improve both agent and customer experience and will help change the trajectory of our retail business. We began a pilot of the new POS in select locations in the U.S. in December. And we believe that removing friction from our retail transaction process will improve not only transaction abandonment rates but will allow our agent partners to serve more customers, ultimately creating a better experience for both our agents and our customers. Finally, driven by our new go-to-market strategy in the U.S., we made the decision to invest increased investment in our marketing program in digital customer acquisition in the fourth quarter so that we could test and learn.We added additional dollars behind the strategy in the United States and also rolled out similar strategic programs in a few European markets as we continue to scale the program worldwide. As we discussed at Investor Day, returning our digital business to positive customer and transaction growth is our top priority. We are shifting our approach for maximizing revenue per transaction, maximizing customer acquisition and growing customer lifetime value. This change has required us to rethink our approach to new customer offers and our approach to maximizing top-of-funnel effectiveness on every marketing dollar. I am pleased to tell you we believe it is working. We reported to you last quarter that new U.S. outbound branded digital customers increased 26% year-over-year in the month of September.Today, I am pleased to report that, that momentum we saw in September continued through the fourth quarter with new U.S. outbound branded digital customers up 30% year-over-year, which is now contributing to an improvement in our transaction trends as well. In Q4, we saw U.S. outbound branded digital transactions grow at 5%, a clear reversal of the decelerating trends we've seen in the business earlier in the year and the fastest transaction growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Growing customers and transaction is important, but so is increasing customer lifetime value. In the near term, increasing retention is the lever and our focus. By simplifying repeat send experiences and increasing our ongoing CRM efforts, we are starting to see improvements.As a case example, if we look at fourth quarter retention rates for our newly acquired U.S. outbound September cohort, going back several years for comparison, the 90-day retention rate for that cohort is the highest we've ever seen. Not only are we acquiring now more U.S. outbound branded digital customers, but we are retaining those customers at a higher rate than we have in the past. While it is clearly too early to definitively say what the ultimate lifetime value of these new customers will be. Early results show promise as typically around 75% of the full year retention value is captured in the 90-day retention rate. Given what we are seeing with transaction growth and retention rates among this new cohort, we believe these new customers are clearly value accretive even at a lower revenue per transaction.The last topic that I'd like to discuss is the success we are seeing in Latin America, which has continued to perform with double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Latin America is a great example of where we are improving our distribution both via owned locations in conjunction with our agent partners. As we discussed on the second quarter call, our corporate-owned locations in Brazil, while only 5% of our retail footprint, accounted for over 50% of the revenue in that country. In 2022, we opened over 50 new corporate- owned locations in Latin America, including new locations in Argentina, Peru and Brazil. Given the right mix of distribution like we have in Latin America, we are seeing results. In Q4, LACA saw 16% new cross-border customer growth with cross-border monthly active users up 11%.Marginally increasing our footprint of exclusive Western Union branded corporate-owned and concept stores in high-volume locations allows us to better control the customer experience, increase the number of products and services we offer, promote the retail to digital escalator, and assist with the eventual adoption of our digital wallet and our financial ecosystem. Importantly, we are able to add these kinds of locations at attractive economics with low capital and oftentimes generate above corporate average operating margins. Our goal is to concentrate corporate-owned and concept stores in high-density areas of the network while continuing to maintain and expand our extremely broad and valuable agent footprint. Given the success we have seen in Latin America, our plan for 2023 is to open another 50 corporate-owned locations in the region and also expand this model of controlled distribution into other parts of our network.Money, Transfer, BankPhoto by Alistair MacRobert on UnsplashEurope in 2022, we opened 15 new concept stores across the region and 1 new corporate-owned location in the Central Madrid train station. In a quick update, Melody, our partner in Rome that we highlighted at Investor Day, will now have 7 stores live, branded Western Union, that includes a new store in Italy that she is opening this week. She and we together are enabling us to better serve the Filipino community across Europe. Before I turn the call over to Matt to discuss our financial results in more detail, I would like to highlight a few key partnerships.

Matt brings a wealth of experience to the role, most recently serving as the CFO of the Merchant Acceptance division of Fiserv First Data. Thank you for your time, and I will now turn the call over to Matt.Matthew Cagwin: Thank you, Devin. And good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with you today to walk through our fourth quarter results and our 2023 financial outlook. Information for the full year results can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules. Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and our 2022 adjusted full year financial outlook, although well below what we believe to be our long-term potential. Overall, 2022 was a challenging year with the start of the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, the increase in macroeconomic uncertainty given high inflation, rising interest rates and slowing global economy. We also announced the migration of 2 key retail European agents, the first of which that took effect in Q4.While headwinds will continue into 2023, we are confident that we can move the needle in the right direction as we continue to lay the building for our Evolve 2025 strategy. We'll go through our 2023 outlook in more detail shortly. Before I do that, let's move into the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter adjusted revenue was down 6% to $1.1 billion. The suspension of our operations in Russia, Belarus impacted the revenue by 3%. Q4 included a number of dynamics, including the net impact of promotional pricing activities, and the loss of a European agent, which negatively impacted our revenue by 2% in the quarter and was partially offset by the growth of other and a 1% benefit from Argentina inflation. Adjusted operating margin was 15.8% in the quarter compared to 24.9% last year, which was positively impacted by 60 basis points from the inclusion of Business Solutions last year.Full year operating margin was 20.4%, landing in the midpoint of our range of our outlook. As Devin highlighted earlier, we accelerated investment in the quarter, supporting our Evolve 2025 strategy, including the expansion of our financial ecosystem, the implementation, scaling of our new go-to-market branded digital strategy and the design and build of our new point-of-sale system. The decrease in fourth quarter operating margin was driven by lower revenue, the rollout of our new brand digital strategy as well as the increase in technology investments. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 14.7% compared to 12.1% in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to discrete tax benefits in the prior year period.Now moving on to adjusted EPS, which was $0.32 in the quarter compared to $0.64 in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted EPS was primarily driven by lower operating profits, a $0.05 negative impact of currency, a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by lower share count. Additionally, in the prior year period, Business Solutions and operations in Russia, Belarus contributed $0.08 and $0.06, respectively. And now turning to our C2C segment. Revenue decreased 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by softness in our retail business and promotional activities related to our new branded digital go-to-market strategy. Transactions in our C2C segment declined 12% in the quarter. Russia, Belarus negatively impacted revenue and transactions by 3 percentage points and 9 percentage points, respectively.When you look at our branded digital business, revenue declined 6% on a constant currency basis. In contrast, transactions grew 2% by our new go-to-market strategy, which was launched in the U.S. during the third quarter. Earlier, Devin spoke about how our strategy drove a 30% growth in new U.S. outbound branded digital customers in the quarter and reversed a decelerating transaction trend that we have seen in the business for a number of quarters. And in the fourth quarter, global new branded digital customers grew approximately 14%. Now moving on to the regional results. In the fourth quarter, North America continued to decrease 7% while transactions declined 2%. The U.S. domestic business and the U.S. outbound business to Russia continued to be a drag on our results.While revenue was also adversely affected by 4% from the promotional price activity in the quarter, as discussed earlier. We were pleased by the continued momentum that we saw in our new U.S. outbound branded digital customers. We saw a 3 percentage point transaction growth in North America brand into digital business, which was a 600 basis point improvement versus Q3, which we believe is another proof point that our strategy is moving us in the right direction. Revenue in Europe and CIS region was down 17% on a constant currency basis with transaction declines of 31%. Russia and Belarus adversely impacted adjusted revenue by 8 percentage points and transactions by 26 percentage points. The region continues to face difficult macro backdrop, competitive pressures and was impacted by the loss of a key retail agent during the quarter.Even with the agent loss, revenue trends improved in the fourth quarter versus the first half of the year, excluding the impact of Russia and Belarus. Revenue in the Middle East, Africa, South Asia region, on a constant currency basis, while transactions decreased 5%. Softness in retail and digital-right label businesses were partially offset by growth in our branded digital business. Revenue growth in Latin America and Caribbean regions accelerated and was up 13% in the quarter on a constant currency basis with transaction growth of 8%. The solid performance in the quarter was led by strength in Ecuador, Venezuela and Nicaragua. And finally, revenue in APAC region was down 14% on a constant currency basis, with transaction declines of 12% due to softness in Australia, Japan and Korea.Now turning to other revenue, which primarily consist of retail bill payments in Argentina and the United States and retail money order in the U.S., which represents 7% of the total company revenue and grew 20% year-over- year on a reported basis. During the fourth quarter, we completed the closing of the second closing of business solution divestiture, transferring the United Kingdom operations. The third closing, which includes the European operations, is currently expected to occur in the second quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory approvals. As a reminder, we've already received the full proceeds from the sale. Now turning to cash flow and balance sheet. In 2022, we generated $582 million of operating cash flow, which included a transition tax payment of $64 million paid in the second quarter.These transition tax payments resulted from 2017 U.S. Tax Act and will increase annually over the next 3 years and stop after 2025. In 2022, we also returned $713 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, continuing our strong track record to return capital to our shareholders. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a $0.235 quarterly dividend payable on March 31, 2023. We also went up our capital expenditures, which were down -- which were $208 million in 2022, which was down 3% versus 2021, with a mix shifting from agent signing bonuses to more software development. And finally, at the end of the quarter, we have cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and debt of $2.6 billion, down roughly $400 million from a year ago.With our leverage ratio now sitting at 2.4 times and 1.2 times on a net basis, which supports our strong balance sheet position and provides us flexibility for potential M&amp;A while we target to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. And then finally, as part of our ongoing operating expense deployment program to optimize our expense base, in 2022, we invested approximately $50 million. This program allowed us to increase our funding in various strategic initiatives like building out our digital wallet, our financial ecosystem and creating our new point-of-sale system, enhancing our digital transaction platform, and creating an integrated omnichannel experience. We are already making good progress on reallocating expenses in 2023, and I look forward to providing additional updates as the year progresses.Now moving to our outlook. Today, we reaffirmed the 2023 adjusted financial outlook we provided at our 2022 Investor Day. Our outlook assumes no major changes in macroeconomic conditions, including changes in foreign currency. We expect adjusted revenue to be down 2% to 4%. As I mentioned earlier, 2023 will face headwinds from Russia, Belarus in Q1 and the loss of 2 European agents throughout the year. We expect the adjusted operating margin to be in the range of approximately 19% to 21%. In the first half of 2023, we expect margins to be below our full year range as we continue to make product investments, expense redeployment related to our cost efficiency program and lapping the impact of Russia and Belarus. And finally, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65.Expected year-over-year decrease in adjusted EPS includes $0.18 related to the sale of Business Solutions, agent losses, Russian and Belarus and currency impacts. Lastly, we would like to provide an update on our 4 key performance indicators that we talked about at Investor Day. In 2022, we improved retail retention by 46 basis points year-over-year. Our goal is to improve this metric by 200 basis points annually, driven by technology improvements, and improvements in our agent and customer experience. Our second performance goal is to grow our new branded digital customers by double digit. Given the success of our new branded digital go-to-market strategy, I'm pleased to report that we've achieved a 14% new customer growth in the fourth quarter.Our third KPI is a 20% omnichannel customer growth. This metric was flat year-over- year in 2022, in line with our assumptions as we believe we need to make improvements to our customer journey and loyalty programs before we'll be able to meaningfully improve our omnichannel customer growth. And finally, the last center we talked about at Investor Day was our ecosystem. Our ecosystem added 15,000 customers a month on average over the past 3 months. We believe our longer-term goal of 100,000 a month will be possible with the rollout of large consumer bases like the United States, Brazil, and we look forward to launching our digital wallet in those countries in the coming quarters. To recap, last year, we delivered our adjusted full year financial outlook and launched our Evolve 2025 strategy, which aims to put us on a path toward sustainable long-term growth.So far, we've made good progress on laying the foundation of our strategy, including accelerating investments and look forward to providing more updates as we continue our journey. Thank you for joining our call today.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Real Estate Companies in the World.The global real estate industry involves the buying, selling, and management of properties such as residential homes, commercial buildings, and industrial spaces. It is a complex and diverse industry that includes a wide range of participants, including real estate agents and brokers, property developers, landlords and property managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and financial institutions. As is true for most other industries, the world of real estate is prone to influence by a number of factors, including economic conditions, demographic trends, government policies, and technological advancements. Following a pandemic-fueled course correction, the global real estate industry faces transformational shifts in how buildings will be used, valued, and transacted in 2023 and beyond. This is evidenced by Deloitte's 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook, which revealed that only 40% of global real estate chief financial officers (CFOs) expected to finish 2022 with higher revenues than last year, and 33% anticipated cuts to expenses, citing sustained high inflation, workforce management, and cyber as the top risks to financial performance.According to a report by GrandViewResearch, the global real estate market size was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030. The market is expected to grow at a healthy pace during the forecast period, owing to the rising population and a desire for personal household space. As of 2021, the commercial real estate space was estimated to be the most important element driving industry expansion. Additionally, in terms of revenue, rental real estate types dominated the market with a share of 52.1% in 2021. This is attributable to rising home prices in developed countries, owing to which there is a rise in the number of renters, favoring the segment growth.Story continuesThe pandemic caused significant changes in consumer demand, which led retailers to modernize their systems to better adapt to these changes. This includes improved analytics and strategies to maintain customer loyalty in response to changing consumer preferences. This holds especially true for Gen Z as it is highly dependent on technology and relies more on the internet and social media to make purchasing and lifestyle decisions. Since Gen Z has experienced technology their entire lives, leasing and marketing campaigns for real estate services should incorporate the use of technology to reach this generation where they are most active, which includes social media, or any other internet source.20 Most Valuable Real Estate Companies in the Worldjason-dent-w3eFhqXjkZE-unsplashOur Methodology We used stock screeners to identify the most valuable real estate companies in the world based on market capitalization as of February 1, 2023.

The constant currency growth measures adjust for the impact of exchange rates and are calculated using average exchange rates during the comparable period in the prior year.Global Payments also has provided supplemental non-GAAP information to reflect the pending divestiture of the consumer portion of the Consumer Solutions segment. Management believes that providing such supplemental financial information should enhance shareholders’ ability to evaluate how the business will be managed going forward.Reconciliations of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the schedules to this release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the items that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures.About Global PaymentsGlobal Payments Inc.

All lines are placed on a listen only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Zbojniewicz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.David Zbojniewicz: Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Ynon Kreiz, Mattel's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Anthony DiSilvestro, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer. As you know, this afternoon, we reported Mattel's 2022 fourth quarter and full year financial results. We will begin today's call with Ynon and Anthony providing commentary on our results, after which, we will provide some time for Ynon, Richard and Anthony to take questions. To help supplement our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion, slide presentation, and earnings release may reference non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin; adjusted other selling and administrative expenses; adjusted operating income or loss and adjusted operating income or loss margin; adjusted earnings per share; adjusted tax rate; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization or EBITDA; adjusted EBITDA; free cash flow; free cash flow conversion; leverage ratio, net debt, and constant currency.In addition, we present changes in gross billings, a key performance indicator. Please note that we may refer to gross billings as billings in our presentation and that gross billings figures referenced on this call will be stated in constant currency unless stated otherwise. Our slide presentation can be viewed in sync with today's call when you access it through the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures as well as information regarding our key performance indicator is included in our earnings release and slide presentation and both documents are also available in the Investors section of our corporate website. The preliminary financial results included in the press release and slide presentation represent the most current information available to management.Story continuesThe company's actual results, when disclosed in its Form 10-Q, may differ from these preliminary results as a result of the completion of the company's financial closing procedures, final adjustments, completion of the review by the company's independent registered public accounting firm, and other developments that may arise between now and the disclosure of the final results. Before we begin, I'd like to caution you that certain statements made during the call are forward-looking, including statements related to the future performance of our business, brands, categories, and product lines. Any statements we make about the future are, by their nature, uncertain. These statements are based on currently available information and assumptions and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.We described some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K, our first quarter 2022 quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our earnings release and the presentation and the other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ynon.Ynon Kreiz: Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Our fourth quarter results were below our expectations as the macroeconomic environment was more challenging than anticipated. We entered the quarter expecting POS to accelerate. We did see POS growth in the quarter, including double-digit growth in December, but it came later than expected and was not enough to offset lower than anticipated consumer demand in October and November. This led to increased discounts and promotions by retailers and a more cautious approach to their inventory replenishment as they manage their existing stock. Our gross margin was negatively affected by higher cost to manage our inventory, but lower operating expenses helped reduce the impact on our bottom line results.Despite the very challenging environment, we achieved full year growth in net sales in constant currency for the fourth consecutive year, including over 2021, which had the company's highest annual growth rate in decades. We lowered our debt, further improved leverage ratio and ended the year on strong financial footing. Our balance sheet is in the best position it has been in years, which will provide more flexibility to execute our strategy. Looking at key financial metrics in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year, net sales declined 22% or 19% in constant currency. Adjusted operating income declined $185 million to $79 million. Adjusted earnings per share declined $0.35 to $0.18 and adjusted EBITDA declined $163 million to $158 million.POS for the quarter was up mid-single digits and up in all four regions. Mattel outpaced the industry and gained market share in the fourth quarter per NPD. Putting it in historical context, this was Mattel's highest fourth quarter POS in eight years. Looking at key financial metrics for the full year as compared to the prior year, net sales were flat or up 3% in constant currency with growth in gross billings in all four regions. Adjusted operating income declined 10% to $689 million. Adjusted earnings per share declined 4% and to $1.25. Adjusted EBITDA declined by 4% to $968 million and leverage ratio improved to 2.4 times compare to 2.6 a year ago. POS for the year grew low single digits and was up in all four regions. This was the highest full year POS in nine years and second highest on record.Comparing 2022 results to 2019, before the pandemic, net sales in constant currency were up more than 20% and adjusted EBITDA more than doubled. The toy industry continued to show its resilience despite macroeconomic challenges. Per NPD, following two years of double-digit growth and a record year in 2021, the toy industry finished flat compared to the prior year and up 22% compared to 2019 prior to the pandemic. We believe the toy industry is a growth industry, and we expect it will continue to grow over time. That said, given continuing macroeconomic headwinds and market volatility that may impact consumer demand, we expect the industry to be flat to slightly up in 2023. Looking at gross billings in constant currency by category. In the fourth quarter, Dolls, Infant, Toddler and Preschool or ITPS and our challenger categories, in aggregate, were down significantly as retailers reduce replenishment orders, Vehicles was up strongly.POS significantly outpaced gross billings and was positive for Dolls, Vehicles and Challenger categories and flat for ITPS. For the full year, vehicles in challenging categories, gross billings grew meaningfully where Dolls and ITPS declined. POS for vehicles and Challenger categories grew low double digits, while for Dolls and ITPS, POS declined low-single digits. Per NPD, Mattel was the number one toy company in the US overall and number one globally in our leader categories, Dolls, Vehicles and Infant, Toddler and Preschool for both the fourth quarter and full year. As it relates to our power brands. Barbie and Fisher-Price and Thomas &amp; Friends were down significantly as retailers reduce replenishment orders, Hot Wheels was up strongly. POS for each of our power brands significantly outpaced gross billings for the quarter.For the full year, Barbie was down following two years of double-digit growth, including the highest year on record. We are very confident about Barbie's strength and continued long-term growth. Hot Wheels performed extremely well and achieved its fifth consecutive record year. Fisher-Price and Thomas declined. Hot Wheel's POS was up low-double digits while Barbie and Fisher-Price and Thomas' POS were down low-single digits. Per NPD, for both the fourth quarter and full year, Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price were each the number one global property in their respective categories, and Barbie was the number two global property overall. Looking at our multiyear performance, we have been successfully executing our strategy to grow Mattel's IP-driven toy business and expand our entertainment offering.Our portfolio is well balanced by category, genre, target demographics and retail channel. Inherently, there will be puts and takes by individual brand varying by quarter and by year. But our business model leverages our global assets and capabilities and allows us to scale our portfolio as a whole. While the fourth quarter was below our expectations, the full year results tell a more complete story in the context of our multiyear growth trajectory. Notably, holiday results were heavily skewed by the volatility and timing of retail inventory movement throughout the year, not by the underlying marketplace performance of our business, with growth in POS for both the fourth quarter and the year. 2022 was another year where we made meaningful progress on key priorities.Here are just a few highlights. We expanded Hot Wheels to new categories such as remote control and skate. We revitalized and relaunched Monster High which was the number one relaunch property within Dolls in the US in the fourth quarter. We continued to strengthen our relationships with the major entertainment companies with additions or extensions of key licenses, including Disney Princess and Disney Frozen, Pokemon and Universal's Trolls. We have grown Mattel Creations, our collector D2C business, which is capitalizing on the strength of our franchises and built-in fan base, increasing traffic by over 40% and volume by over 85%. We achieved $106 million of cost savings in 2022 from our Optimizing for Growth program and increased the targeted 2023 cost savings goal to $300 million from $250 million.We also made meaningful progress on capturing the full value of our IP. We partnered with Skydance Media to develop a Matchbox live-action motion picture as part of our growing development slate and announced that J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot will produce the Hot Wheels movie with Warner Bros. The Barbie movie completed principal photography and is in post production towards its global theatrical release this summer. On the television side, we launched 11 series and specials, including our first live-action movie musical Monster High, which premiered at Nickelodeon and Paramount+. The Mattel Adventure Park is under construction and is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2023. And the Mattel163 mobile gaming joint venture with NetEase grew to over $175 million in revenue.As we look ahead to 2023, we continue to foresee a period of volatility and macroeconomic challenges impacting consumer demand. Additionally, there are two significant factors that will impact our 2023 performance. These are elevated retailer inventory levels, which will have a onetime negative impact on our top line and incentive compensation returning to target levels, which will increase SG&amp;A. With that context, in 2023, we expect Mattel full year net sales in constant currency to be comparable to 2022 and for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $900 million to $950 million. Our guidance assumes growth in consumer demand for our product and positive POS for the year. We aim to outpace the toy industry and gain market share. Beyond 2023, we believe our strategy will drive top and bottom-line growth.In closing, while the fourth quarter was below expectations, the full year growth in constant currency and increase in consumer demand for our product speak to the strength of our portfolio as a whole, even in a challenging macroeconomic environment. We believe we are well positioned to continue executing our multiyear strategy to grow our IP-driven toy business and expand our entertainment offering and create long-term shareholder value. Reflecting our improved financial position and confidence in our strategy, we expect to resume share repurchases in 2023. We are committed to Mattel's purpose to empower the next generation to explore the wonder of childhood and reach their full potential. And to our mission to create innovative products and experiences that inspire, entertain, and develop children through play.We look forward to updating you on the progress of our strategy at our upcoming Virtual Investor presentation. And now Anthony will cover the financials in more detail.Dragon Images/Shutterstock.comAnthony DiSilvestro: Thanks Ynon. As Ynon mentioned, Mattel's fourth quarter performance was below expectations. I will start with a discussion of those items, which negatively impacted our performance relative to guidance. Our consumer takeaway or POS was below expectations as the macroeconomic environment proved more challenging than anticipated. Retailers reduced replenishment orders more than we anticipated and we incurred higher costs to manage our inventories, including closeout sales, as well as the negative fixed cost absorption impact from lower sales in the fourth quarter. With the shortfall to expectations, we significantly reduced incentive compensation, which mitigated the earnings impact in 2022. With that context, while POS increased by mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter, net sales were $1.402 billion, down 22% compared to the prior year or down 19% in constant currency.Adjusted gross margin declined by 620 basis points, reflecting the impact of managing inventory levels and cost inflation. Adjusted operating income declined by $185 million to $79 million, adjusted EPS declined by $0.35 to $0.18 and adjusted EBITDA declined by $163 million to $158 million. Looking at our full year results, net sales were flat as reported or up 3% in constant currency. Adjusted gross margin declined 230 basis points to 45.9% due primarily to cost inflation, higher cost of managing inventories, and increased royalties, partly offset by price increases and cost savings. Adjusted operating income was $689 million compared to $763 million in the prior year, while adjusted EPS declined by $0.05 to $1.25. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $39 million or 4% to $968 million, primarily due to the lower adjusted gross margin partly offset by lower adjusted SG&amp;A.Turning to gross billings in constant currency beginning with the fourth quarter. As we've discussed on prior calls, first half gross billings outpaced POS as retailers were replenishing lower inventory, exiting the prior year and building inventory levels ahead of the holiday season. We expected this to reverse in the third quarter and accelerate in the fourth quarter, with POS outpacing gross billings. Although POS did improve and outpaced shipping in the fourth quarter, consumer demand was lower and came later than expected. This caused retailers to reduce replenishment orders throughout the quarter, which impacted our performance across categories and regions. With that context, while POS increased by mid-single digits in the quarter, Total company gross billings declined 19%.Looking at gross billings in the fourth quarter by category, Dolls was down 24% with declines in Barbie and American Girl, partly offset by growth in Monster High and early shipments of Disney Princess and Disney Frozen. Barbie gross billings declined 30% with POS down 1%. Barbie outpaced the industry in the fourth quarter and gained global market share per NPD. Vehicles grew 10%, driven by double digit growth in Hot Wheels and successful launches of remote control and skate. Infant, Toddler and Preschool declined 31%, while POS was flat. Mattel was number one globally in the Infant, Toddler and Preschool category and gained share in the quarter per NPD. Challenger categories in aggregate declined 22% due to lower sales of Action Figures, Games and Plush.Building sets was comparable to the prior year. For the full year, total company gross billings grew 3% with POS increasing low single digits. Dolls was down 6% due to declines in Barbie, American Girl and Spirit, partly offset by growth in Monster High, early shipments on Disney Princess and Disney Frozen and strength in Polly Pocket. As discussed last quarter, sales of higher priced items have been negatively impacted by macroeconomic challenges facing consumers. Barbie was down 8% following two years of double-digit growth. American Girl declined 16%, primarily due to soft performance for 2022 Girl of the Year and historical characters. Vehicles grew 20%, driven by Hot Wheels and Matchbox. Hot Wheels grew 22%, driven by core diecast cars, Monster Trucks and category expansion.Infant, Toddler and Preschool was down 6%, due to declines in baby gear, and infant, partly offset by growth in Imaginext and Little People. Mattel outperformed the industry and gained global share for the full year per NPD. Challenger categories increased 10% overall, with gains in action figures and building sets, partly offset by declines in Plush and Games. As Ynon mentioned, quarterly results were heavily skewed by the volatility and timing of retailer inventory movement throughout the year, not by the underlying marketplace performance of our business with growth in POS for both the fourth quarter and year. Looking at fourth quarter gross billings in constant currency by region. North America declined 25% while POS increased mid-single digits.EMEA declined 16% and POS increased mid-single digits. Latin America declined 8% with POS up low-single digits. And Asia Pacific declined 5% with POS increasing high-single digits. Ending retailer inventory levels were up in both dollars and weeks of supply compared to low levels a year ago and are elevated as we head into 2023. Retail inventory is predominantly current and of good quality. For the full year, gross billings and POS grew in each of our four regions. North America gross billings grew 1% with POS up low-single digits. EMEA increased 5% with gains in all key markets. POS increased high-single digits. Latin America increased 14% with strong growth in Mexico and Brazil. POS increased low-single digits. Asia Pacific sales grew 1% with gains in Australia and Japan, offset by the impact of COVID-related closures in China.POS increased mid-single digits. Per NPD, Mattel was number one in the US for the 29th consecutive year, number two in EMEA and number one in Latin America. Adjusted gross margin declined 620 basis points to 43.1% in the quarter. The decline was due to several factors: inventory management, primarily closeout sales and obsolescence of 350 basis points, cost inflation of 330 basis points, fixed cost absorption of 180 basis points associated with lower volume and increased royalties and other of 140 basis points. These negative factors were partly offset by price increases, which contributed 220 basis points and savings from our Optimizing for Growth program, which had a positive impact of 170 basis points. For the full year, adjusted gross margin declined 230 basis points to 45.9%.Moving down to P&amp;L. In the fourth quarter, advertising expenses declined 9% to $243 million as we reduced advertising in response to lower volume. For the full year, advertising expense declined 2% and as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points to 9.8%. Adjusted SG&amp;A in the fourth quarter declined $73 million, or 21%, to $282 million. The decline was primarily due to significantly reduced incentive compensation as well as cost savings, partly offset by increases in compensation and bad debt expense. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $79 million compared to $264 million a year ago. The decline was due to lower sales and adjusted gross margin, partly offset by lower advertising and adjusted SG&amp;A. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $163 million to $158 million, impacted by the same factors.Cash from operations for the full year was $443 million, compared to $485 million in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to higher working capital usage, partly offset by improvements in net income, excluding the impact of non-cash items. Free cash flow was $256 million, compared to $334 million in the prior year. The decline was due to lower cash from operations and increased capital expenditures. Capital expenditures increased by $35 million to $187 million, reflecting investments to increase production capacity in fashion dolls and die-cast cars to support future growth. As a percentage of adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow conversion was 26%, compared to 33% in the prior year. Taking a look at the balance sheet. We finished the year with a cash balance of $761 million, compared to $731 million in the prior year, as free cash flow was primarily used to reduce debt.In the fourth quarter, we redeemed the $250 million, 3.15% notes due 2023. Total debt was $2.326 billion, compared to $2.571 billion in the prior year, a reduction of $245 million. Accounts receivable declined by $212 million to $860 million, primarily due to the decline in fourth quarter net sales. Inventory was $894 million, compared to $777 million in the prior year, an increase of $117 million or 15%. Leverage ratio improved to 2.4 times at the end of the year, compared to 2.6 times in the prior year. We continued to improve our credit metrics, as highlighted by the recent action by Moody's Investor Services to upgrade our credit rating to investment grade. We continued to generate significant cost savings. Optimizing for gross savings were $39 million in the quarter and $106 million for the full year, exceeding our prior forecast of $80 million to $90 million.Since 2021, when we launched the program, we have achieved $204 million of annualized savings. Based on our progress and continued focus on optimizing our operations, including actions to further streamline our organizational structure, we are increasing the targeted 2023 cost saving goal to $300 million from $250 million. Total estimated cash expenditures to implement the program are now forecasted to be $135 million to $165 million. As Ynon said, looking ahead to 2023, we continue to foresee a period of volatility and macroeconomic challenges impacting the consumer. Additionally, there are two significant factors that will impact our 2023 performance. Anticipated retail inventory reductions will have a onetime negative impact of three to four percentage points on our topline, particularly in the first half and incentive compensation returning to target levels will increase SG&amp;A by approximately $100 million.With that context, we expect full year net sales in constant currency to be comparable to the prior year with growth in the Dolls and Vehicles categories, offset by declines in Infant Toddler and Preschool and in our Challenger categories in aggregate, primarily due to action figures as we lap theatrical tie-ins in 2022. Our guidance assumes growth in consumer demand for our product with positive POS performance for the year. With respect to the Power brands, we expect Barbie and Hot Wheels to grow and for Fisher-Price to decline. Going forward, the Fisher-Price Power brand will exclude Thomas &amp; Friends, allowing greater clarity on the brand's performance. In connection with The Barbie movie, and as part of our capital-light approach, 2023 guidance includes movie-specific toy sales, a producer fee, and estimated participation in the movie success for licensing the IP.Foreign currency translation is expected to have a slightly positive impact on our topline performance based on current spot rates. Adjusted gross margin is expected to increase to approximately 47% compared to 45.9% in 2022. This reflects the anticipated benefit from pricing and cost savings, partly offset by cost inflation and fixed cost absorption associated with lower production volumes. With respect to timing, we expect the gross margin improvement in the second half. In the middle of the P&amp;L, we expect SG&amp;A to increase as incentive compensation is forecast to return to target levels, while advertising is expected to remain relatively stable as a percent of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $950 million and adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.20 per share.Interest expense in 2023 is expected to benefit from the redemption of the $250 million 3.15% notes at the end of 2022 and the adjusted tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 25% to 26% compared to 24% in 2022. Capital expenditures are forecast to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million compared to $187 million in 2022. Anticipated spending in 2023 includes continuing spend to increase capacity of fashion dolls and die-cast cars supporting future growth as previously announced. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to exceed $400 million, driven by a higher conversion ratio as we improve our working capital performance. In terms of phasing, sales and earnings are expected to be down significantly in the first half as we wrap 20% top line growth last year, and further reflecting anticipated retail inventory reductions in 2023.This is expected to be followed by top and bottom line growth in the second half. We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility, including inflation that may impact consumer demand. The guidance considers what the company is aware of today, but remains subject to further market volatility, any unexpected disruption and other macroeconomic risks and uncertainties. With our improved balance sheet and outlook for increased free cash flow, we expect to resume share repurchases in 2023 with approximately $200 million remaining under the company's current authorization. This action is consistent with our capital allocation priorities and reflects confidence in our strategy to create significant long-term shareholder value.While Mattel's fourth quarter was below expectations, we outpaced the industry and gained market share. In 2022, we continue to improve our financial position, further reduced our debt and achieved an investment-grade rating from Moody's, one of the three major ratings agencies. We look forward to sharing more information on our financial outlook and capital deployment priorities at our upcoming virtual investor presentation.

And that comes hot on the heels of major layoff news at Hasbro. Soz has toys on his brain today for his take.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, definitely I do. And I think if you want to tie up what we're hearing from the toy industry, it is essentially this, economy slowing. A lot of these companies have pushed through higher prices. Consumers saying, well, we just don't-- not going to buy these toys. We're going to wait till they're about 70% off.But let's see the high-level news here. Mattel earnings last night, stock under pressure, as Julie just mentioned. Sales down 22%, that is not the normal rates of growth we've been seeing from Mattel over the past two years. So I think that has a lot of investors spooked a little bit and has surprised them. Inventories up 15%, in large part because those sales really fell off the map. Gross profit margins down 620 basis points year over year.Interesting to hear on the earnings call last night really two things from Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz, frequent guest on our program. Says, our fourth quarter results were below expectations as the macroeconomic environment was more challenging than anticipated. And to that end, I think taking a more sober tone on the outlook for the toy industry this year.Ynon noting that the-- he sees the toy industry flat to slightly up this year in terms of sales, which is-- would mark a deceleration from recent growth rates.But it's not just Mattel. A couple of weeks ago, Hasbro just came out with just another stinker of a pre-earnings announcement, said they are canning 15% of their workforce. Fourth quarter sales crashed 17% there for Hasbro. They will report their earnings on February 17. I can't imagine they will have anything good to say, given the pre-announcement like this.Story continuesI also caught up too with another friend of our show, the-- James Zahn, the editor in chief over at ""Toy Book"" who is just probably one of the most interesting-- or probably the best person to reach out to in all things toys. He told me a couple problems for Hasbro outside of its just debacle of Wizards of the Coast and their various gaming efforts.One, they recently moved to no plastic packaging for certain toys. And what that is-- do-- you have the differences right here. On the right, you see old school Hasbro packaging. People like to see their toys, what they look like when they're in the stores.On the left, you're now seeing the new packaging. Yes, you have the toy on the outside of the box. But you can't actually see the workings, the mechanisms of the toys. And James is telling me that is leading to sales pressure for some of Hasbro's products. Also telling me that the Hasbro base price on the 6-inch action figure jumped from $19.99 to $22 then $24 and then, in some cases, $30.That is a large-- that is some serious inflation on price-sensitive toys here. And parents are just not going to buy these things. And that's why you see inventory in the channel starting to really back up.My take is this-- and maybe not a shocker, just given my really negative commentary here. There's no reason to go near these stocks. Yeah, that's not a buy or sell decision. That's just basic-level analysis. You have sales falling off a cliff for toys. You have high inventory levels. You have retailers like Walmart and Target not placing a lot of replenishment orders right now.And it is unlikely that the toy industry really gets back to growth maybe until the holiday season of this year.JULIE HYMAN: I didn't recognize some of those toys. Did you recognize the guys that look kind of like He-Man? But I don't know. Maybe that was He-Man.BRAD SMITH: The early ones? No, I didn't I didn't recognize too many of them. I recognized the ones towards the end, but that was it. And the toys are noticeably smaller too, even on screen.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, do you know this series?BRIAN SOZZI: They--JULIE HYMAN: I'm not familiar.BRIAN SOZZI: They don't make toys, I would argue, like they used to. I personally think the quality has gone down. I used to be a little bit of a toy geek.JULIE HYMAN: Well, forget about the quality. I don't-- maybe this is series the kids are watching.BRAD SMITH: That's from ""Jurassic Park.""JULIE HYMAN: That I recognize. That's a dinosaur.BRAD SMITH: Who was that dude before? I don't know who he is.BRIAN SOZZI: I've got a good example for you, real quick. So I bought my nephew a new-- for Christmas, a Pound Puppy, Pound Puppies, stuffed animal. I remember having them when I was a kid. I had four of them. I bought him two.And you could tell, like the eyes on the Pound Puppy, they didn't look right. They were cheaper quality. The stuffing felt a little different. It's just not the toy I remember from the '80s. And it was disappointing. And I don't know if he still has it. They like playing with the boxes at that age. But still, I was disappointed. I wanted more from the Pound Puppy.JULIE HYMAN: I'm very sorry.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I was disappointed actually.JULIE HYMAN: I'm sorry. I feel like--BRIAN SOZZI: I'm getting sad now, actually.JULIE HYMAN: I feel like we've got a puppy eyes situation coming on.]"

MAT delivered fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein both earnings and revenues missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, after surpassing the same for 10 straight quarters. Both the metrics declined on a year-over-year basis.Following the results, the company’s shares declined 9.8% in the after-hours trading session on Feb 8.After the results, Ynon Kreiz, Mattel’s chairman and CEO, stated, “Our fourth quarter results were below our expectations, as the macro-economic environment was more challenging than anticipated. While less than expected, POS grew in the quarter and the full year and we achieved growth in net sales in constant currency for the fourth consecutive year.”Mattel, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMattel, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMattel, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Mattel, Inc. QuoteEarnings &amp; Revenues DiscussionFor the fourth quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 18 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 53 cents.Net sales during the quarter amounted to $1,401.9 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,658 million. The top line declined 22% year over year. Moreover, on a constant-currency (cc) basis, sales decreased 19% from the prior-year quarter.In the North America segment, gross billings declined 25% (as reported and at cc) year over year. Gross billings in the International segment declined 19% (reported) and 13% (cc) year over year. The decline was primarily due to the dismal performance of Infant, Toddler, and Preschool (including Fisher-Price and Thomas &amp; Friends), Dolls (including Barbie), and Action Figures, Building Sets, Games and Other, partially offset by growth in Vehicles (including Hot Wheels).Net sales in the North America segment declined 26% year over year on a reported and cc basis. Net Sales in the International segment decreased 18% on a reported basis and 12% at cc year over year.Story continuesBrand-Wise Worldwide SalesMattel, through its subsidiaries, sells a broad range of toys. These items are grouped under different brands — Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, Thomas &amp; Friends and Other.Worldwide gross billings by Mattel Power Brands decreased 22% (on a reported basis) and 19% (at cc) year over year to $1,559.6 million. The Barbie brand witnessed a decline of 33% (on a reported basis) and 30% (at cc) year over year.However, gross billings at the Hot Wheels brand rose 8% (on a reported basis) and 13% (at cc) year over year. Gross billings at the Fisher-Price and Thomas &amp; Friends brands were down 33% (on a reported basis) and 30% (at cc) year over year. Gross billings at Other increased 21% (on a reported basis) and 18% (at cc) year over year.Operating ResultsAdjusted gross margin contracted 620 basis points year over year to 43% due to inventory management initiatives, which includes higher close-out sales as well as inventory obsolescence expenses, higher input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost absorption and higher royalty costs.During the quarter under discussion, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses decreased $80 million year over year to $281 million. The decrease can primarily be attributed to a decline in incentive compensation and savings from the Optimizing for Growth program.Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2022, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $761.2 million compared with $731.4 million as of Dec 31, 2021.

BAX reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 88 cents, significantly missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. The bottom line declined 15% from the year-ago quarter as costs and expenses rose due to inflationary pressures, the negative impact of foreign exchange and higher interest expense.GAAP EPS in the quarter was 36 cents, down 23% from the prior-year quarter. The decline was due to the recognition of one-time special items totaling $263 million after tax.Revenue DetailsRevenues of $3.89 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.77 billion. The top line improved 11% year over year on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency (cc) basis. Sales grew 2% on an operational basis — excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and the December 2021 acquisition of Hillrom.Geographical DetailsBaxter reported operating results through three geographic segments — Americas (North and South America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia Pacific).In the Americas, Baxter revenues totaled $1.74 billion, down 1% on a year-over-year basis and flat at cc.In EMEA, revenues totaled $750 million, down 8% from the year-ago quarter while up 5% at cc.In APAC, revenues of $668 million declined 9% from the prior-year quarter while up 2% at cc.Baxter International Inc.

During the quarter under review, the company recorded $734 million in sales from Hilrom’s businesses. Patient Support Systems reported revenues of $360 million, while Front Line Care and Surgical Solutions delivered revenues of $293 million and $81 million, respectively. Sales of the segments have increased sequentially for the last two reported quarters.Story continuesRenal CareThis segment reported revenues of $981 million in the quarter under review, down 5% from the prior-year quarter but up 3% at cc.Medication DeliveryRevenues at the segment amounted to $745 million, down 5% from the year-ago quarter and down 2% at cc.PharmaceuticalsRevenues at the segment totaled $525 million, down 9% from the year-ago quarter and down 1% at cc.Clinical NutritionRevenues at the segment were $231 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter but up 6% at cc.Advanced SurgeryRevenues at the segment amounted to $247 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter and up 8% at cc.Acute TherapiesThis segment reported revenues of $158 million, down 10% from the prior-year quarter and down 3% at cc.BioPharma SolutionsThis segment reported revenues of $172 million, up 6% from the prior-year quarter and up 12% at cc.OtherRevenues in the segment were $38 million, up 23% on a year-over-year basis and at cc.Margin AnalysisBaxter reported an adjusted gross profit of $1.62 billion for the fourth quarter, up 3.9% year over year.

As a percentage of revenues, the operating margin contracted 310 bps to 17.1% in the quarter under review.2023 Guidance IssuedFor first-quarter 2023, Baxter anticipates sales to decline by 3% on a reported basis and 1% at cc.For the same period, adjusted EPS is expected between 46 cents and 50 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 77 cents per share.For full-year 2023, Baxter anticipates sales to improve 1-2%. Sales are expected to remain flat or grow by 1% at cc.Adjusted earnings per share are estimated in the range of $2.75-$2.95 in 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $3.56.Summing UpBaxter ended fourth-quarter 2022 on a dismal note, wherein revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings missed the same. The company witnessed lower sales across five of its business units. Contraction in growth rates across all geographies and gross and operating margins is concerning. Unfavorable currency movement hurt the sales growth rate. Moreover, earnings outlook for 2023 is significantly lower than market expectations, reflecting inflationary pressures, rising interest expense and higher tax rate.Meanwhile, cut-throat competition in the MedTech market remains a woe. An increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is concerning. Weakness in Renal Care, Pharmaceuticals, BioPharma Solutions and Acute Therapies is disappointing.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Baxter carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

The decline was primarily due to the reduction in volume, decreased manufacturing productivity and increased supply chain and inflationary costs.MarginsGross profit in the reported quarter was $521.5 million, down 3.1% from the prior-year quarter’s gross profit. Gross margin contracted 162 basis points (bps) year over year to 42.9% in the reported quarter.Story continuesSTERIS witnessed a 1.7% year-over-year drop in selling, general and administrative expenses to $305 million.

During the quarter, the company faced significant foreign-exchange headwinds, apart from supply chain and inflation-related challenges. The lowered reported revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2023 indicates the continuation of this gloomy trend.Barring AST and Healthcare, the poor reported revenue performance across two of STERIS’ operating segments is a major concern.

The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%.The year-over-year increase in revenues was supported by strong revenue performance across all the company’s business units despite a difficult macroeconomic environment.Segments in DetailAt Plasma, revenues of $135.5 million (accounting for 44.4% of total revenues) rose 40.4% year over year (up 42.3% on an organic basis) in the reported quarter.Revenues at Blood Center (24%) fell 3.1% (up 3.1% on an organic basis) to $73.4 million.Hospital revenues (29.9%) rose 11.3% (up 14.4% on an organic basis) to $91.6 million. Under the Hospital segment, despite continued macroeconomic challenges, including hospital staffing shortages, budgetary constraints and COVID-related challenges in China., the company’s revenues and market share grew meaningfully.Service revenues (accounting for the rest) declined 8% (down 1.2% on an organic basis) to $4.9 million.MarginsThe fiscal-third quarter gross margin was 51.9%, down 136 basis points (bps) year over year. The company-adjusted gross margin was 52.5%, reflecting a decline of 240 bps compared with the year-ago period when Haemonetics reported one of its highest-ever adjusted gross margins of 54.9%.Adjusted operating margin was 16.8%, down 158 bps from the year-ago quarter. Haemonetics noted that higher adjusted operating expenses in both periods were due to higher performance-based compensation, continuous investments in sales and marketing, higher freight costs and normalized spending levels, partially offset by additional savings from the operational excellence program. In the fiscal third quarter, the company also had higher research and development costs, primarily due to increased investments in product innovation.Story continuesFinancial PositionHaemonetics exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $224 million compared with $241.2 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Long-term debt at the end of the fiscal third quarter was $756.8 million, down from $759.6 million at the end of fiscal second quarter.Cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $193.4 million compared with a $104.2 million net cash used in operating activities a year ago.As part of its previously announced $300 million share repurchase program, the company repurchased 997,406 shares of its common shares for $75.0 million via an accelerated share repurchase program in the fiscal second quarter. However, it has not repurchased any additional stock in fiscal Q3.2023 GuidanceThe company updated its outlook for 2023.For 2023, the company now expects GAAP total revenue growth in the range of 15-17% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 12-15%). Organic revenue growth is currently expected in the range of 18-20% (up from the prior projection of 15-18%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.12 billion.The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share in the band of $2.90-$3.00 (compared with the previous estimate of $2.70-$3.00). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.87.Our TakeHaemonetics exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023, with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The robust performance of the Plasma and Hospital business, with continued strength in the Hemostasis Management product line, instills optimism. Robust contributions from the Vascular Closure business also seem promising. The full-year outlook for revenues and EPS with strong year-over-year growth indicates the continuity of this growth momentum.However, the year-over-year decline in the company’s Blood Center business raises apprehension. The contraction of both margins in the face of macroeconomic challenges is an added woe.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksHaemonetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

NUE as the Bull of the Day and Kimberly-Clark KMB as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Netflix NFLX, Meta Platforms META and Uber Technologies UBER.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:The Zacks Steel – Producers industry is currently ranked in the top 8% (21 out of 250) of all Zacks Industries.And as we’re all aware, 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to its group, making it clear why it’s critical for investors to target stocks in a thriving industry.A company residing in the industry and a part of the Zacks Basic Materials sector, Nucor Corp., has seen its near-term earnings outlook shift positively across all timeframes over the last 60 days.Nucor is a leading producer of structural steel, steel bars, steel joists, steel deck, and cold-finished bars in the United States.How does the company currently shape up? Let’s take a closer look.Share PerformanceNucor shares have been hot year-to-date, tacking on nearly 25% in value and crushing the S&amp;P 500’s impressive 7.5% gain.And over the last year, Nucor shares have gained 37%, again crushing the S&amp;P 500’s performance.The positive price action within shares tells us that buyers have been active, something that was a rarity for most stocks over the last year.Quarterly ResultsNucor has consistently exceeded quarterly expectations, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations in four consecutive quarters.Just in its latest release on January 26th, Nucor penciled in a steep 17% earnings surprise and reported sales more than 10% above expectations.Dividends &amp; Cash FlowMany stocks in the Zacks Basic Materials sector pay dividends, and Nucor is no different; NUE’s annual dividend currently yields 1.2% paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 6% of its earnings.Story continuesWhile the yield is below the sector average, Nucor’s 6.2% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to fill the gap.Further, Nucor has been a cash-generating machine as of late, posting free cash flow of $2 billion in its latest quarterly release.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.Additionally, the top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Nucor would be an excellent stock for investors to keep on their watchlists, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:Stocks have gotten off a solid start in 2023, undoubtedly a welcomed development following a brutal 2022.The feared earnings “apocalypse” has yet to materialize, helping keep the market afloat. In addition, many stocks are now seeing their earnings outlooks drift higher.However, one big-time name in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, Kimberly-Clark, has seen its near-term earnings outlook come under pressure as of late, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Kimberly-Clark is principally engaged in manufacturing and marketing a wide range of consumer products worldwide.  KMB operates three business segments: Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, and K-C Professional.Let’s take a closer glance at the company.Share PerformanceKimberly-Clark shares have struggled to find buyers year-to-date, down more than 5% and widely underperforming relative to the S&amp;P 500.Still, over the last year, KMB shares are hanging onto a 1.5% gain, easily beating the S&amp;P 500 in the same period.Buyers have backed off following a big run-up from October 2022 to mid-December 2022.Quarterly PerformanceKMB has primarily posted mixed bottom line results, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in six of its last ten quarters.Still, revenue results have been much better, with Kimberly-Clark exceeding sales expectations in six consecutive quarters.DividendsThe stock does pay a dividend, currently yielding 3.6% annually.In addition, the company has shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, carrying a 4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Bottom LineMixed bottom line results and negative earnings estimate revisions from analysts paint a challenging picture for the company in the near term.Kimberly-Clark is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook over the last several months.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:3 Big Surprises of Q3 Earnings Season So FarImagine this –Once every few months, you’re required to release information detailing your current financial standing. The public can see where you’ve spent money, made money, or even how much you’ve saved.Sounds scary, right?That’s just a different way of describing what earnings season is.So far, this earnings season has turned out better than feared, helping to keep the market afloat following a brutal 2022.And there have been several big surprises, including those from Netflix, Meta Platforms and Uber Technologies.Let’s take a closer look at what each company delivered.Uber Technologies Sets Quarterly Trips RecordUber posted better-than-expected quarterly results, crushing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 240% and reporting earnings of $0.29 per share.Uber generated roughly $8.6 billion in revenue throughout the period, surpassing our consensus estimate marginally and growing nearly 50% year-over-year.There were also other several notable highlights, including –Gross Bookings totaled $30.7 billion, growing an impressive 19% year-over-year and exceeding our consensus estimate by nearly 0.6%. This is illustrated in the chart below.Further, total trips throughout Q4 tallied 2.1 billion, representing a quarterly record and growing nearly 20% year-over-year. In addition, the total beat our consensus estimate by roughly 1.5%.And to top it off, Uber posted adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, growing $579 million from the year-ago quarter.Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO, on the results, “We ended 2022 with our strongest quarter ever, with robust demand and record margins,” He continued, “Our outlook for a Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA step up in Q1 builds on that progress, and sets us up for yet another record year.""Netflix Crushes Subscriber EstimatesNetflix reported mixed top and bottom line results, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by roughly 75%.Quarterly revenue totaled $7.8 billion, modestly ahead of estimates and growing 2% year-over-year.However, the focus point of the entire release remained the company’s Net Subscriber Additions.Results came in well above expectations; Netflix reported Net Subscriber Adds of roughly 7.7 million, handily beating our consensus estimate of 4.5 million by nearly 70%.It represented the company’s third consecutive quarter exceeding our consensus estimate for Net Subscriber Additions, undoubtedly a major positive.The market cheered on the better-than-expected Subscriber Additions, with Netflix shares climbing nearly 9% the following trading session.Meta Platforms Cuts ExpensesThe market was impressed with META’s quarterly report, with the company exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 40%.In addition, quarterly revenue tallied $32.2 billion, again exceeding expectations by roughly 3%.Of course, there were also some key developments, including –The company unveiled a massive $40 billion share buyback program to increase shareholder value.Most importantly, the company revealed some cost-cutting measures. As many are aware, investors were critical of META’s capital expenditures (CapEx), especially during a challenging 2022 business environment.Nonetheless, the company expects full-year 2023 total expenses in a range of $89 billion – $95 billion, down from prior views of $94 billion – $100 billion.Further, META expects CapEx in a range of $30 billion – $33 billion for full-year 2023, again down from prior expectations of $34 billion – $37 billion.Bottom LineEarnings season continues to chug along, with many companies reporting daily.And in the coming weeks, just as many are slated to do the same.Several companies, including Netflix, Meta and Uber, have stolen the show so far, reporting results that had investors celebrating.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

130,8173f3ff-b812-3602-915c-4bb3c9f785c1,NFLX,2023-02-10,Is Netflix (NFLX) Stock Outpacing Its Consumer Discretionary Peers This Year?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-nflx-stock-outpacing-consumer-144002550.html,1675953602,STORY,['NFLX'],"[The Consumer Discretionary group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Has Netflix (NFLX) been one of those stocks this year? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Consumer Discretionary sector should help us answer this question.Netflix is one of 281 individual stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #8 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Netflix is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFLX's full-year earnings has moved 2% higher. This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock's earnings outlook is more positive.Based on the most recent data, NFLX has returned 24.4% so far this year. Meanwhile, the Consumer Discretionary sector has returned an average of 14.1% on a year-to-date basis. This means that Netflix is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is another Consumer Discretionary stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year. Since the beginning of the year, the stock has returned 53.6%.For Warner Bros. Discovery, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 2.3% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Breaking things down more, Netflix is a member of the Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which includes 23 individual companies and currently sits at #105 in the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has gained an average of 21.5% so far this year, so NFLX is performing better in this area. Warner Bros. Discovery is also part of the same industry.Story continuesNetflix and Warner Bros. Discovery could continue their solid performance, so investors interested in Consumer Discretionary stocks should continue to pay close attention to these stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

131,4ad0c371-0384-3585-97a6-2f7e737be37d,TJX,2023-02-10,Does TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-tjx-companies-nyse-tjx-110052014.html,1676026852,STORY,"['TJX', 'BRK-A']","[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies What Is TJX Companies's Net Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that TJX Companies had US$3.36b in debt in October 2022; about the same as the year before. However, it does have US$3.36b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$6.92m.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is TJX Companies' Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that TJX Companies had liabilities of US$11.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$11.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$3.36b in cash and US$713.0m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$18.7b.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since TJX Companies has a huge market capitalization of US$93.3b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt. While it does have liabilities worth noting, TJX Companies also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Story continuesAlso good is that TJX Companies grew its EBIT at 19% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine TJX Companies's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. TJX Companies may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, TJX Companies generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 83% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Summing UpAlthough TJX Companies's balance sheet isn't particularly strong, due to the total liabilities, it is clearly positive to see that it has net cash of US$6.92m. The cherry on top was that in converted 83% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$741m. So is TJX Companies's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for TJX Companies (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

ABBV reported adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022, beating both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate, which stood at $3.54. The reported earnings also exceeded the guidance of $3.51-$3.55. Earnings rose 16.9% year over year.ABBV’s revenues of $15.12 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $15.35 billion and $15.32 billion, respectively. Sales rose 1.6% year over year on a reported basis and 3.8% on an operational basis. Sales were driven by immunology and neuroscience products, with key drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi and Vraylar contributing to the top line. This was partially offset by lower sales of Juvederm and Imbruvica.Shares of AbbVie were up 1% in pre-market trading on Feb 9 following the announcement. AbbVie’s shares have gained 1.3% in the trailing 12 months period compared with the industry’s 9.2% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAll growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at constant exchange rates (CER).Quarter in DetailIn immunology, AbbVie’s flagship drug Humira recorded a year-over-year sales rise of 6.0% to $5.58 billion on an operational basis. Sales in the United States climbed 9.9% to $5.01 billion, which more than offset the 16.9% decline in ex-U.S. market sales of $573 million. The drug’s sales met the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at $5.58 billion.Humira’s international sales were affected by the launch of several direct biosimilar drugs in Europe by other pharma companies, including Amgen AMGN, Sandoz and Biogen BIIB. Companies like Amgen, Sandoz and Biogen were the first to start commercializing a Humira-biosimilar in Europe in 2018. Amgen, Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer, Sandoz and many other companies have already received FDA approvals for their own Humira biosimilars, many of which are expected to be launched at various times this year per agreements with AbbVie. Last week, Amgen announced the launch of Amjevita in the United States, becoming the first company to launch a Humira biosimilar in the country.Story continuesNet revenues recorded from Skyrizi in the fourth quarter were $1.58 billion, up 78.9% on an operational basis year over year. This significant rise in sales is due to label expansions to the drug to include new patient populations in the last few quarters. Skyrizi sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $1.55 billion and $1.47 billion, respectively.During the quarter, Rinvoq registered sales of $770 million, up 55.4% year over year on an operational basis. Ex-U.S. sales of the drug rose 74.5% year over year during the quarter. However, the drug’s sales missed both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $868 million and $859 million, respectively.Sales from the neuroscience portfolio increased 5.1% on an operational basis to $1.71 billion, driven by higher sales of Botox Therapeutic and Vraylar. The company also generated additional sales from the migraine drug Qulipta. Neuroscience sales figures missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $1.90 billion and $1.93 billion, respectively.While Botox Therapeutic sales rose 10.7% to $728 million, sales of Vraylar increased 15.5% to $565 million. Sales of AbbVie’s oral migraine drug Ubrelvy were $197 million, up 7.7% year over year.The recently launched Qulipta generated $52 million in product revenues compared to $62 million in third-quarter 2022.AbbVie’s oncology/hematology (including Imbruvica and Venclexta) sales declined 11.2% on an operational basis to $1.63 billion in the quarter, as growth of Venclexta sales, was more than offset by lower U.S. sales of Imbruvica. While the oncology/hematology sales beat the Zacks Consensus of $1.54 billion, it missed our model estimate of $1.66 billion.Fourth-quarter net revenues from Imbruvica were $1.12 billion, down 19.5% year over year. AbbVie developed the drug in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. The company shares international profits earned from Imbruvica with J&amp;J.U.S. sales of J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica grossed $841 million, down 24.6% from the year-ago figure. Sales of the J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica declined amid rising competition from novel oral treatments in the United States. AbbVie’s share of profit from the international sales of the J&amp;J-partnered drug rose 1.6% to $274 million.ABBV’s leukemia drug Venclexta generated revenues of $516 million in the reported quarter, reflecting 12.2% year-over-year growth.AbbVie’s aesthetics portfolio sales were down 4.2% on an operational basis to $1.29 billion. The sales figure was lower than management’s expectations as declining sales of Juvederm and other aesthetic drugs offset growth in the sales of Botox Cosmetic. Sales of Botox Cosmetic rose 7.1% on an operational basis to $642 million, while Juvéderm’s sales fell 19% on an operational basis to $322 million.Juvederm sales were hurt by the impact of COVID in China and the suspension of AbbVie’s aesthetics business operations in Russia, a key market for fillers.Eye care portfolio sales declined 35.2% on an operational basis to $590 million. Sales of Restasis, a key drug in the portfolio, decreased 69.4% year over year to $110 million.Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses declined 4.7% to $3.15 billion, while adjusted R&amp;D expenses were $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, down 3.2% year over year. The adjusted operating margin represented 52.1% of sales.Full-Year ResultsAbbVie reported revenues of $58.05 billion, up 5.1% year over year. The company’s adjusted earnings for 2022 were $13.77 per share, up 16.4% from the year-ago period’s levels.2023 GuidanceAbbVie issued earnings per share (EPS) guidance for 2023. The company expects adjusted EPS in the range of $10.70-$11.10, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 19.4-22.3%.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, check out 5 Most Valuable Hotel Companies In The World. Hotel and lodging industry revenue has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2022 was expected to end with $188 billion in revenue, an increase of 11% compared to 2019. However, adjusted for inflation, revenue per available room is not projected to exceed pre-pandemic levels until 2025. Hospitality companies who provide liquor and live entertainment might have to allocate 5% to 20% more budget for insurance in 2023, and establishments with facilities such as spa services will see rate increases as well. Hospitality industry profit margins will deteriorate in 2023 due to supply chain constraints, inflation, and higher wages pressuring profit margins. Based on strength in Q1 2022, ongoing halts in construction, greater inflation, and positive employment data, CBRE lifted its forecast of hotel performance for 2022 and beyond. CBRE said it anticipates complete rebound in average daily rate in 2022 and in demand and revenue per available room in 2023. Regardless of COVID-19 challenges, RevPAR in Q1 2022 came in at $72.20, above 61% from the prior year quarter. RevPAR growth was fueled by a 39% raise in ADR and 16% higher occupancy. Rachael Rothman, CBRE’s head of hotel research &amp; data analytics, said on May 31, 2022: “To date, there has been no sign that the more than 50 percent increase in gas prices and the stock market’s hovering near bear-market territory are dampening hotel demand. However, in the past, a steep decline in the S&amp;P 500 and high gas prices have often caused RevPAR growth to decline, which raises the specter of a pullback in RevPAR later this year. Despite this possibility, our outlook remains that the market will continue to recover.”The RevPAR growth in 2023 will result from equal parts of occupancy and average daily rate increases, which are expected to climb 4.2% during the year. The inventory of high-priced hotels is anticipated to escalate 2.1% in 2023, higher than the supply growth rates of 0.1% for lower and 2% for mid-priced hotels. Story continuesTo benefit from the lucrative hotel industry, investors can pick up stocks of some of the most valuable hotel companies like Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT). Our Methodology We used stock screeners to identify the most valuable publicly listed hotel companies in the world based on market capitalization as of February 8, 2023.

While leisure rates dropped a little in the seasonally slower back-to-school period, this decline was expected and was more than offset by increases in business transient and group bookings. Robust rates across the industry are leading to higher margins, including for Hyatt. Hyatt is using the increased cash flow to buy-in its shares, indicating that it sees value in the stock.”9.

Airline and travel reservations and hotel management have not been happy places to be in the past year, although it is worth noting nowhere near as bad as investing in actual airlines or hotels. InterContinental’s share price fall of -9.9% compares with a drop of -35.1% for the Dow Jones US Hotel and Lodging REIT Index. This illustrates the virtues of InterContinental’s business model in contrast to the industry it serve.However, whilst they face a difficult situation, we are pleased that management has spent its time and effort managing liquidity and costs in an effort to ensure that they survive these events rather than pointlessly speculating about the likely timescale and course of recovery. We believe that they should not only survive but also strengthen their competitive position.”8. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc.

(NASDAQ:HST) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Shares of Host Hotels (HST) were also sold during the 3rd quarter for similar reasons as Cogent given a degradation in the prospect of a return in group leisure and business travel. The capital was similarly redeployed.”7. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM)Market Capitalization as of February 8: $15.837 billionMGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) was incorporated in 1986 and is based in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Wynn Resorts is out with a mixed picture on its quarterly results. However, the company announcing this morning its plan for a private offering of $600 million of Wynn Resorts financed senior notes due 2031. A brighter picture on the earnings front for MGM Resorts, though, international, beating revenue estimates and reporting a narrower than expected earnings loss here.I just want to kind of swing back to Wynn Resorts for a hot second here. One thing that I've been doing, a quick Ctrl Command F on in these earnings reports and the earnings calls as well is anything on Macau, anything on China.And you heard that in the Wynn call last night from Craig Billings, the CEO there, saying that the recent actions in Macau and mainland authorities reopening the market give them some good confidence that the difficulties are behind them here. So, to what extent that begins to show up in future earnings reports, that will be something to keep a close eye on here as we move forward with regard to this broader kind of reopening to the travel and tourism landscape here, too.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, that's a good tip, Brad. Just in reading earnings calls in general-- I know we're focusing here on Wynn, but reading some of these transcripts and just pull out keywords. Some of the keywords I use to just mine this data, right now, it's China. It is disinflation. And of course, it's economy. And you'd be surprised some of the themes that you can quickly put together just by doing that.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, it's hard to overstate what a dramatic change these businesses had over the past few years because they had been so weighted to China. I mean, both of these companies, whether you're talking about WIM or Wynn or MGM, both of them get Vegas revenue. They get other regional casinos in the US. In the case of MGM, it's a bunch of them. In the case of Wynn, it's mostly Boston.Story continuesAnd then you have China mostly-- or, I guess, all in Macau, right? And the China revenue had basically gone away over the past few years, both because of regulation then, obviously, because of COVID. So now they're essentially trying to rebuild that business. But the shift in revenue, I mean, I can't imagine working in an operation. You must get seasick from the sort of back and forth happens from that. And that's still the case that the China revenue is much smaller as a percentage of the whole than it was before.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, they gave actually some stats to that effect as well, to your point, Julie, saying the Chinese New Year holiday period in that period, the casino, the mass table drop actually reached 95% of 2019 Chinese New Year levels, strong play across the spectrum and premium. And within this premium experience, people go into casinos. You know you're going to spend money at the end of the day. It's like when you're going to Disney World. You know you're going to spend money. And so--JULIE HYMAN: You just surrender. It's just gonna happen.BRAD SMITH: Just take my money. Just take the cash here.

It further tightens supply constraints from OPEC+, which Saudi Arabia had already led into a 2 million barrel-a-day production cut last year in an effort to buoy prices. Delegates from the group signaled they won’t take any action to fill in the gap created by Russia.Crude prices jumped on the news, with global benchmark Brent trading 2.2% higher at $86.34 a barrel by 12:22 p.m. in London. Prior to this week, the international benchmark had dropped 9% since mid-January, helping to ease inflationary concerns.Russia’s reduction is equivalent to about 5% of its January output. The Kremlin has repeatedly hinted at such a move since the European Union and the Group of Seven industrialized countries began discussing capping the price of Russian crude and refined product exports amid the war in Ukraine.“Russia believes that the mechanism of price caps on Russian oil and petroleum products is an intervention in market relations and an extension of destructive energy policies of the collective West,” Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement on Friday. His press service confirmed that crude output will be affected by the cuts.Since the imposition of EU import bans and the price cap “most observers expected some output loss, and Moscow may just be attempting to portray a compulsory cut as a voluntary policy choice,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. “I doubt Russia’s OPEC+ partners were taken by surprise and do not expect the supply reduction will alter their ‘stay put’ policy stance.”Story continuesIn the short term there is nobody to fill the supply gap created by the Russian cuts, said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG.As of now, Russia is able to sell its oil volumes to foreign markets, but it does not want to adhere to the price restrictions imposed by Western nations, according to Novak. “When making further decisions, we will act based on how the market situation is developing,” he said.Market OutlookThe Russian cuts are unlikely to affect global oil prices in the longer term, according to Viktor Katona, crude analyst at Kpler. The reduction so far has only been announced for March and Russia’s output could rebound after that, he said.Given the nation’s ability to export crude amid sanctions, the production cuts may lead to lower refinery runs while supplies to foreign clients could remain robust, Katona added.It also might take longer than a month for Russia to redistribute the crude oil and product volumes that have been freed up as a result of Europe’s import bans, said Sergey Vakulenko, a veteran Russia oil expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“Then Russia might continue the production cut and accompanying PR campaign,” he said.Falling RevenuesRussian oil production has been surprisingly resilient, amid several waves of energy restrictions imposed by western nations and their allies.Since hitting a post-invasion low of 10.05 million barrels a day in April, Russian oil output rebounded to around 10.9 million at the end of 2022. It stayed close to that level in January, despite the European Union’s ban on most seaborne imports of the country’s crude on Dec. 5.Still, Moscow’s oil revenue has taken a hit in recent months amid the price caps and generally lower global crude prices. The discount at which Urals crude — Russia’s main export grade — trades to the international benchmark has also widened, as the country seeks out new markets and alternative methods of shipment in the face of sanctions.(Updates with OPEC+ context in second paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekBrazil’s Richest Man Loses Billions as His M&amp;A Machine Breaks DownHow a Big Short Cost India’s Adani Empire $100 BillionThe Little Research Firm That Took On India’s Richest ManForget Hard or Soft Landing: Meet the Rolling RecessionTech Holdouts Are Making Life Hell for Their Colleagues©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

But the FTSE 100 still slipped 0.5 percent after having hit record highs earlier this week.""In reality, the nuances of whether the UK is or isn’t in a recession are likely to be lost on the majority of people, many of whom are struggling with their finances on a day-to-day basis,"" said market analyst Michael Hewson at CMC Markets.Bucking the downward stock markets trend, Tokyo rose Friday on a weaker yen, though the currency rallied after the market closed on reports that the Japanese government would nominate Kazuo Ueda to replace Haruhiko Kuroda as head of the country's central bank.Ueda is an economist and former member of the Band of Japan policy board. But analysts said the yen's advance may be more to do with the fact deputy governor Masayoshi Amamiya would not take the post, which would have likely seen a continuation of the current dovish approach.""While unexpected and a potentially hawkish development it probably doesn't change that much from a monetary policy point of view in the short term,"" said Hewson.- Key figures around 2130 GMT -Brent North Sea crude: UP 2.2 percent at $86.39 per barrelWest Texas Intermediate: UP 2.1 percent at $79.72 per barrelNew York - Dow: UP 0.5 percent at 33,869.27 (close)New York - S&amp;P 500: UP 0.2 percent at 4,090.46 (close)New York - Nasdaq: DOWN 0.6 percent at 11,718.12 (close)London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.4 percent at 7,882.45 (close)Frankfurt - DAX: DOWN 1.4 percent at 15,307.98 (close)Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.8 percent at 7,129.73 (close)EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 1.2 percent at 4,197.94 (close)Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.3 percent at 27,670.98 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 2.0 percent at 21,190.42 (close)Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.3 percent at 3,260.67 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0684 from $1.0740 on ThursdayPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2051 from $1.2121Euro/pound: DOWN at 88.56 pence from 88.61 penceDollar/yen: DOWN at 131.42 yen from 131.59 yenburs-jmb/bgs]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Washington companies and stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, the state of Washington would be the 30th largest country in the world, with a GDP of $677 billion in 2021. This is aided by being home to some of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world, including one of only 4 companies in the world which have a market cap of more than $1 trillion. Home to two of the biggest tech companies in the world, Washington also has some of the highest concentration of STEM workers in the country.25 biggest Washington companies and stocksPixabay/Public DomainSeveral industries are extremely important to Washington's GDP including agriculture/food manufacturing, aerospace, clean technology, information and communication technology, life science, maritime and of course the military/defense sectors. Washington is considered to be a global leader in aircraft and uncrewed aerial systems while the agriculture sector is home to around 300 crop commodities whose markets are continuing to expand growth including eliminating trade barriers, streamlined regulations and more efficient transportation in addition to ensuring that the state's farmlands are protected. Clean technology has been a major focus for the state of Washington and innovation and growth in this sector, which is beneficial for reducing our impact on the planet, and incentives are offered in this respect which we'll come back to later. But of course, the leading sector is information and technology, with the state benefitting from a wealth of talent located there.Currently, the unemployment rate for the state of Washington is 4%, which is higher than the national average and ranks 33rd among all state in the country. This is despite the plethora of jobs created by the biggest Washington companies and stocks. This isn't a recent trend, as historically, the state of Washington's unemployment rate has generally been higher than the national average because of a high share of resource-based industries because of which employment rates fluctuate. This will of course not be helped by the state's biggest company laying off 18,000 people.Story continuesTo encourage businesses, Washington state provides various incentives and as mentioned earlier, there are specific incentives related to renewable energy including sales tax exemptions for qualifying solar equipment from July 2019 to December 2029 while the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System allowing business systems to deduct up to 85% of the cost of solar equipment from their tax liability over a period of 5 years.The biggest Washington companies and stocks have combined revenues of well over $1 trillion while the combined market cap is close to $3.5 trillion, though a large majority of both of these numbers is derived from just the top 4 companies. For our ranking, we first selected all Washington  companies included in Fortune 500 while scouring the internet for more top companies for which financial data is available, regardless of whether they're listed or not. Their revenue was determined either from Fortune 500, Yahoo Finance, annual reports or press releases while market cap was confirmed form Yahoo Finance, with 60% weightage assigned to revenue and 40% to market cap. For companies which aren't listed, ranking is based on revenue alone. So, let's now take a look at Washington's top companies, starting with:25.

Kern expects 2023 to be a turnaround year.To hear Expedia Group officials tell it, 2023 is shaping up as a year when lots — but not all — of the tough, behind-the-scenes tech work will have been completed, and the company will start to reap the benefits.Officially, Expedia Group guided toward double-digit top and bottom line growth year over year in 2023.But having now moved its major online travel agency brands, namely Expedia.com and Hotels.com, to a common tech platform, with vocational rent brand Vrbo up next in 2023, and with a new unified and cross-brand loyalty program in the works this year, then good things are in the offing, the company said.“Of course, our confidence in our strategy is ultimately only possible because of the underlying technology that we have invested so much in over the last several years,” Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern told financial analysts Thursday as the company released its fourth quarter and full-year 2022 earnings. “This is what has enabled Expedia U.S. to go faster, and all of our brands and geographies, begin to ride on that same tech stack, we will expand our ability to compete and win in more places. Work that created a drag on our business in ’22 and like the migration of Hotels.com to our core platform, become big unlocks for us in ’23.”Kern highlighted the performance of “Expedia U.S.,” a seldom-used category that was mentioned six times during the call, and that speaks volumes about 2022 because the Group downplayed some geographies and smaller brands because of the tech migration and other factors.Expedia U.S. saw its loyalty numbers jump 300 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2019, and it has nearly 60 percent more engaged app users, the company said.“Of course, when you look at our all-up B2C (business to consumer) numbers, the accelerating performance of Expedia U.S. has been largely offset by our intentional de-emphasis of some smaller noncore brands or pull back in certain geographies where we did not have the right model, and of course, our much-discussed technical migration, which required significant work and like all migrations resulted in some short-term friction,” Kern said.Story continuesIn addition to “severe weather” and foreign currency headwinds in 2022, the migration of the Hotels.com tech platform required engineers to focus on that transition and to sacrifice site testing and other front-end improvements.“We expect our test velocity around optimizing our sites to grow roughly fourfold with the same resources this year as more engineers and product team members are freed up post migration, and our test can be run across our entire base of core OTA traffic,” Kern said. “In other words, we will have many more tests where the winners get deployed across a much larger base.”With the exception of vacation rental brand Vrbo, which will still have to cope with the tech migration in 2023, Expedia Group expects its online travel agency testing of new site features to accelerate four-hold, and artificial intelligence (AI) will play a role.“And a lot of our tests are now really more than what used to be a single test because they’re AI-driven with multi variables,” Kern said. “And so one test might be the equivalent of 10 tests.”In the fourth quarter, Expedia Group’s net income fell 36 percent to $177 million on revenue of $2.6 billion, a 15 percent year over year jump. The company’s revenue in the quarter was negatively impact by severe weather, including Hurricane Ian, but “demand was otherwise strong and accelerating, and has been markedly stronger since the start of the year,” Kern said.Fourth quarter booked room nights increased 19 percent to 70.8 million year over year.Full year 2022 booked room rights jumped 26 percent to 312 million. The company notched $352 million in net income on a revenue jump of 36 percent to $11.6 billion.Expedia Group’s fourth quarter results fell short of analysts’ expectations on gross bookings and net income.The gross booking value of Expedia Group’s lodging business jumped 20 percent in January, officials said.Although Expedia Group’s partnership with China’s Trip.com Group on outbound China travel is a small portion of Expedia’s overall business, China’s reopening is expecting to provide a boost in 2023, Kern said, in addition to the tech stack migration, and the expected launch of Expedia Group’s consolidated One Key loyalty program.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.27bUS$6.44bUS$6.59bUS$6.89bUS$6.76bUS$6.73bUS$6.74bUS$6.80bUS$6.88bUS$6.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -0.55%Est @ 0.24%Est @ 0.79%Est @ 1.17%Est @ 1.44% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$5.9kUS$5.6kUS$5.4kUS$5.2kUS$4.8kUS$4.5kUS$4.2kUS$3.9kUS$3.7kUS$3.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$47bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.1%) = US$141bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$141b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$71bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$117b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$470, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.850. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Lockheed MartinStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 77 cents per share.For full-year 2023, Baxter anticipates sales to improve 1-2%. Sales are expected to remain flat or grow by 1% at cc.Adjusted earnings per share are estimated in the range of $2.75-$2.95 in 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $3.56.Summing UpBaxter ended fourth-quarter 2022 on a dismal note, wherein revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings missed the same. The company witnessed lower sales across five of its business units. Contraction in growth rates across all geographies and gross and operating margins is concerning. Unfavorable currency movement hurt the sales growth rate. Moreover, earnings outlook for 2023 is significantly lower than market expectations, reflecting inflationary pressures, rising interest expense and higher tax rate.Meanwhile, cut-throat competition in the MedTech market remains a woe. An increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is concerning. Weakness in Renal Care, Pharmaceuticals, BioPharma Solutions and Acute Therapies is disappointing.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Baxter carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

This compares to earnings of $1.04 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -6.38%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drug and medical device maker would post earnings of $0.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.82, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Baxter , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $3.89 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.05%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.51 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Baxter shares have lost about 10.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Baxter?While Baxter has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Baxter: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

ABBV reported adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022, beating both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate, which stood at $3.54. The reported earnings also exceeded the guidance of $3.51-$3.55. Earnings rose 16.9% year over year.ABBV’s revenues of $15.12 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $15.35 billion and $15.32 billion, respectively. Sales rose 1.6% year over year on a reported basis and 3.8% on an operational basis. Sales were driven by immunology and neuroscience products, with key drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi and Vraylar contributing to the top line. This was partially offset by lower sales of Juvederm and Imbruvica.Shares of AbbVie were up 1% in pre-market trading on Feb 9 following the announcement. AbbVie’s shares have gained 1.3% in the trailing 12 months period compared with the industry’s 9.2% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAll growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at constant exchange rates (CER).Quarter in DetailIn immunology, AbbVie’s flagship drug Humira recorded a year-over-year sales rise of 6.0% to $5.58 billion on an operational basis. Sales in the United States climbed 9.9% to $5.01 billion, which more than offset the 16.9% decline in ex-U.S. market sales of $573 million. The drug’s sales met the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at $5.58 billion.Humira’s international sales were affected by the launch of several direct biosimilar drugs in Europe by other pharma companies, including Amgen AMGN, Sandoz and Biogen BIIB. Companies like Amgen, Sandoz and Biogen were the first to start commercializing a Humira-biosimilar in Europe in 2018. Amgen, Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer, Sandoz and many other companies have already received FDA approvals for their own Humira biosimilars, many of which are expected to be launched at various times this year per agreements with AbbVie. Last week, Amgen announced the launch of Amjevita in the United States, becoming the first company to launch a Humira biosimilar in the country.Story continuesNet revenues recorded from Skyrizi in the fourth quarter were $1.58 billion, up 78.9% on an operational basis year over year. This significant rise in sales is due to label expansions to the drug to include new patient populations in the last few quarters. Skyrizi sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $1.55 billion and $1.47 billion, respectively.During the quarter, Rinvoq registered sales of $770 million, up 55.4% year over year on an operational basis. Ex-U.S. sales of the drug rose 74.5% year over year during the quarter. However, the drug’s sales missed both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $868 million and $859 million, respectively.Sales from the neuroscience portfolio increased 5.1% on an operational basis to $1.71 billion, driven by higher sales of Botox Therapeutic and Vraylar. The company also generated additional sales from the migraine drug Qulipta. Neuroscience sales figures missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $1.90 billion and $1.93 billion, respectively.While Botox Therapeutic sales rose 10.7% to $728 million, sales of Vraylar increased 15.5% to $565 million. Sales of AbbVie’s oral migraine drug Ubrelvy were $197 million, up 7.7% year over year.The recently launched Qulipta generated $52 million in product revenues compared to $62 million in third-quarter 2022.AbbVie’s oncology/hematology (including Imbruvica and Venclexta) sales declined 11.2% on an operational basis to $1.63 billion in the quarter, as growth of Venclexta sales, was more than offset by lower U.S. sales of Imbruvica. While the oncology/hematology sales beat the Zacks Consensus of $1.54 billion, it missed our model estimate of $1.66 billion.Fourth-quarter net revenues from Imbruvica were $1.12 billion, down 19.5% year over year. AbbVie developed the drug in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. The company shares international profits earned from Imbruvica with J&amp;J.U.S. sales of J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica grossed $841 million, down 24.6% from the year-ago figure. Sales of the J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica declined amid rising competition from novel oral treatments in the United States. AbbVie’s share of profit from the international sales of the J&amp;J-partnered drug rose 1.6% to $274 million.ABBV’s leukemia drug Venclexta generated revenues of $516 million in the reported quarter, reflecting 12.2% year-over-year growth.AbbVie’s aesthetics portfolio sales were down 4.2% on an operational basis to $1.29 billion. The sales figure was lower than management’s expectations as declining sales of Juvederm and other aesthetic drugs offset growth in the sales of Botox Cosmetic. Sales of Botox Cosmetic rose 7.1% on an operational basis to $642 million, while Juvéderm’s sales fell 19% on an operational basis to $322 million.Juvederm sales were hurt by the impact of COVID in China and the suspension of AbbVie’s aesthetics business operations in Russia, a key market for fillers.Eye care portfolio sales declined 35.2% on an operational basis to $590 million. Sales of Restasis, a key drug in the portfolio, decreased 69.4% year over year to $110 million.Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses declined 4.7% to $3.15 billion, while adjusted R&amp;D expenses were $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, down 3.2% year over year. The adjusted operating margin represented 52.1% of sales.Full-Year ResultsAbbVie reported revenues of $58.05 billion, up 5.1% year over year.

196,c7b83d0f-ef62-312d-b454-830a2cca7181,CCI,2023-02-10,Can Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) Maintain Its Strong Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crown-castle-inc-nyse-cci-120042075.html,1676030442,STORY,['CCI'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Crown Castle How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Crown Castle is:22% = US$1.7b ÷ US$7.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.22 in profit.Does Crown Castle Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Crown Castle has a better ROE than the average (6.9%) in the REITs industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Crown Castle.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Crown Castle's Debt And Its 22% Return On EquityCrown Castle does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.88. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Crown Castle may not be the best stock to buy.

However, over the past seven years, the percentage of women on our company's small molecule process research &amp; development (SM PR&amp;D) team has nearly doubled and continues to grow.""This progress is important because it reflects our mindset that diversity and inclusion fuel creativity and innovation.""""Our group today looks dramatically different than it did when I first started 14 years ago because we've taken steps to build more diverse teams,"" said McCabe Dunn.And, women chemists and engineers are vital to our success.""While we've come a long way in the last decade, achieving greater gender equity must continue to be a priority for all leaders,"" said Kevin Campos, vice president.One successful approach has been for women leaders to take more active roles in recruiting talent. This allows for greater relationship building among female candidates applying for jobs in science fields and provides a vision for growth opportunities at our company.""We're also expanding relationships with more academic institutions and casting a wider net to find excellent talent,"" said McCabe Dunn. ""As more women join the company and see the strong career paths open to them, we expect to see even greater diversity.""A woman chemical engineer in a male-dominated fieldEighteen years ago, when Marguerite Mohan joined Merck, she was one of a small group of women scientists on the team. Although not different from what she experienced academically, she recalls being asked whether she thought this environment would limit her.""I had no concerns being in the gender minority…I knew I was here because of my ability.""""I loved being a chemical engineer and wanted to apply my skills where I'd make an impact on people's lives. The interface of research and manufacturing was a great place to start,"" said Mohan.Story continuesTasked with developing and scaling up processes to safely, innovatively and robustly produce drug candidates for clinical trials and commercial use - these teams deliver for patients through cutting-edge science. They challenge the status-quo and try new things. That's also how they recognize and develop talent.""We're committed to making sure everyone's voice is heard and respected. This has allowed women to frame what technical growth looks like from our point of view, bringing diversity of thought to the problem-solving and leadership table,"" said Mohan. ""By challenging the status quo, we're creating stronger, more innovative teams filled with unique scientific talent.""A new generation of women scientistsNiki Patel and Cindy Hong joined our company within the past six years - both drawn, in part, to our reputation as a scientific leader committed to improving human health.""I was very aware of the team's novel and innovative science through publications in high-profile, peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences. This was a place where I wanted to do great science,"" said Patel, associate principal scientist.It was also a place where both Patel and Hong knew they'd fit in.""As a female graduate student, I was definitely outnumbered. But, when I interviewed here, I saw such diversity on the teams - including at leadership levels.""""I knew this environment was right for me,"" said Hong. ""I've worked with great female and male leaders since joining the company and been exposed to many different areas of expertise. I see real opportunities for growth.""Women empowering other women in scienceStrong networks and outreach are important to not only maintain a pipeline to potential female scientist candidates but also retain and promote those already on the team. They can include things like collaborative communities, mentor programs, publishing papers or grassroots efforts.""We're empowered to take steps to support women in this field.""""For example, I've helped organize forums to discuss topics on diversity and inclusion and participated in career panels geared toward supporting women and underrepresented groups in the field,"" said Patel.Sometimes, that support might simply be a quick note of recognition.""I try to acknowledge micro-accomplishments in the moment - things that seem small but are important to that person,'"" said Mohan. ""It's a simple, personal way to show someone they - and their work - matter.""In addition to kudos from colleagues, many of our female scientists have been recognized externally. In the last three years, 12 women in the department have been honored with individual awards or as key contributors in team awards. These awards include the ACS Division of Organic Chemistry Early Career Investigator, ACS WCC Rising Star, ACS Fellow, Heroes of Chemistry, the Edison Patent Award, the ACS Award for Computers in Chemistry and Pharma, and an HBA Rising Star.""We have a high success rate,"" said McCabe Dunn. ""Ninety-two percent of the women we've nominated or renominated for individual awards have won.""Can women have a successful career in science? Absolutely.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Francis.Story continuesFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. 2023 is off to an exciting start for Illumina and for genomics, and I'm pleased to announce that we've started shipping the first NovaSeq X Plus systems to customers. Later in my remarks, I'll share how we're scaling our manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to ship 40 to 50 units in Q1 and over 300 units for the year. First, I'll cover our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Illumina delivered fourth quarter revenue of approximately $1.1 billion and full year 2022 revenue of approximately $4.6 billion, in line with the upper end of our revised guidance range. We placed more than 3,200 instruments in 2022, increasing our installed base to approximately 23,000 instruments worldwide.Delving now into each of our platforms, starting with high-throughput. We've had a fantastic customer response to the NovaSeq X series launch. Both orders and the advanced pipeline continue to grow. There's strong global interest with orders from more than 25 countries, 4x more than in the first quarter of the NovaSeq 6000 launch. We're also seeing stronger-than-expected clinical adoption and orders from new to high-throughput customers who are bringing sequencing in-house due to NovaSeq X's ease of use and cost benefits. The NovaSeq X has had the strongest pre-order book of any Illumina instrument launch, and this demand will catalyze a multiyear upgrade cycle. We also shipped more than 340 NovaSeq 6000s in 2022, with more than 1/3 of those instruments for oncology testing and nearly half to new to high-throughput or new to Illumina customers.Placements were strong in the first half of 2022 even after a record 2021. Second half placements were tempered by growing customer excitement for the NovaSeq X series. Across 2022, average consumable pull-through for the NovaSeq 6000 was approximately $1 million per instrument. Moving to mid-throughput. In 2022, we shipped a record 1,215 instruments and saw the fourth consecutive record year for NextSeq shipments. The fourth quarter of 2022 was also the highest quarter on record for NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments. Customers appreciate NextSeq 1000/2000's unique capabilities as the only mid-throughput sequencer with built-in analysis and the first mid-throughput instrument to include the 2x300 kits. Close to 25% of NextSeq 1000/2000 units in 2022 were placed with new to Illumina customers.For low-throughput, in 2022, we shipped approximately 1,670 instruments, bringing nearly 700 new customers to Illumina. Our low-throughput instruments consistently open new geographies and applications while serving as an effective entry point to sequencing. Shifting to our markets. Our clinical markets currently include testing for oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease. In 2022, shipments to clinical customers represented 45% of core Illumina consumables. For 2022, oncology testing consumables grew 7% year-over-year from utilization of MGS-based molecular profiling across early detection, therapy selection and minimal residual disease. We see expanding opportunities for our oncology products globally. For our TruSight Oncology 500 distributed therapy selection assay, sample volume grew approximately 60% year-over-year across more than 500 accounts.And for 2023, we expect more than $100 million in revenue for TSO 500. Also in oncology, GRAIL continues to have strong demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. Galleri is the only multi-cancer early detection test in a $40-plus billion market, and it had the fastest first year revenue ramp in cancer screening test history. GRAIL has established over 60 partnerships with leading health systems, self-insured employers and other health care stakeholders. In 2022 alone, more than 4,500 providers ordered the test, contributing to the more than 60,000 Galleri test orders that have been received to date. The Galleri test has received FDA Breakthrough Designation and was recognized by Time as one of the best inventions of 2022, by The Atlantic as one of the Breakthroughs of the Year and by Fast Company as one of the world-changing ideas of 2022.Galleri was also featured in an AARP health story on game-changing medical breakthroughs, improving lives today. GRAIL expects this exciting momentum to continue and to translate into an expected revenue CAGR of 60% to 90% over the next 5 years. Beyond oncology, genetic disease testing had a record quarter in Q4 and another strong year in 2022. For 2022, GDT consumable shipments grew 11% year-over-year, driven by broader adoption of whole genome sequencing globally and increased demand for rare disease treatment. We also saw additional evidence generation, with the European Society of Human Genetics updating its guidelines to recommend increased adoption of whole genome sequencing in diagnostics as well as increased coverage for rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases.Recently, 2 of the largest health insurance companies in the U.S., based on the number of patients served, announced that whole genome sequencing will be covered for patients with rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases, starting this quarter. And AIM Specialty Health, which provides lab benefits management services for more than a dozen regional health plans in the U.S. now considers comprehensive genomic profiling medically necessary for appropriate patients with advanced cancers. Tens of millions more Americans will be covered, a huge win for patients and our customers and for Illumina. Turning to our research and applied markets. Consumable shipments represented 55% of core Illumina consumables in 2022. Boosting the diversity in genetic databases is a significant need for our customers as they work to understand the underlying cause of disease.Genomics, combined with clinical information, can increase drug discovery success by up to 150% and reduce costs by up to 50%. To achieve this, we need more samples over time and for more diverse populations. We recently announced an agreement with Amgen and its subsidiary, deCODE Genetics, to sequence the first 35,000 genomes in our collaboration with Nashville Biosciences. This sample cohort will represent the largest data set of African-Americans to date as we aim to accelerate equitable access to precision health therapies, and they've already begun sequencing the first samples. Moving now to 2023. We're excited for this launch year and have now started shipping NovaSeq X Plus systems to our first customers. We're on track to ship 40 to 50 NovaSeq X instruments in Q1 and more than 300 instruments in 2023.To accomplish this, we boosted our operational capabilities. We've built state-of-the-art consumable manufacturing facilities in the U.K., Singapore and San Diego, adding 9 new production lines. At launch, we already have 2 to 3 months of inventory for each of the 6 core consumable SKUs. In our instrument manufacturing facility in Hayward, we are fully staffed and ramping up production and capacity. Right now, there are more than 60 NovaSeq X instruments in various stages of the production process. All primary and secondary sequencing metrics are meeting or exceeding specifications. In addition, we've taken steps to ensure our supply chain is strong. We began adding and onboarding new suppliers 2 years ago to secure the material and component supply fueling NovaSeq X production.We're also equipping our global commercial team to guide our customers as they receive the first NovaSeq X shipments. In January, we brought together more than 800 sales team members in a 3-day training session, giving them new tools and insights to support customers as they accelerate genomics worldwide with this powerful new instrument. The team is energized to bring these new capabilities to market and excited to see the outcome of years of preparation. We are confident that our organization's scale, reach and experience will enable our customers to sequence more samples, run more analyses and obtain more data than ever before. And NovaSeq X unlocks greater elasticity, we expect average pull-through for the X to comfortably exceed NovaSeq 6000 over time.Illumina will remain focused on supporting our valued customers with transformative innovations and continue to advance our road map to accelerate the genome era. Customers' interest worldwide continues to be very strong, and they are eager to harness the capabilities of the X, the most powerful, most sustainable and most cost-effective sequencer ever developed to further unlock the power of the genome. You'll hear more about the customer experience and data at AGBT this week. Now before I turn the call over to Joydeep, I'd like to thank him and welcome him to the role as Illumina's Chief Financial Officer. With over 2 decades experience in the industry, Joydeep brings strategic expertise, deep industry knowledge and extensive global business experience to the role.He is a proven and disciplined leader with a strong track record of creating value and an ideal partner to help drive the next phase of Illumina's growth. I'll now turn the call over to Joydeep for more detail on the quarter and our full year outlook.Joydeep Goswami: Thanks, Francis, and thanks for the kind introduction. I'm excited to step into the role on a permanent basis and continue to work with all of you. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, and conclude with additional remarks on our current outlook for 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in supplementary data available on our website. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.08 billion, down 10% year-over-year or down 7% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging.Non-GAAP earnings were $22 million or $0.14 per diluted share, including dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $159 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were lower than expected due to approximately $87 million in incremental tax expense from the R&amp;D capitalization requirements that were not repealed in Q4 2022 despite broad bipartisan support. The incremental tax expense includes approximately $80 million recorded in Q1 through Q3 that was ultimately not reversed in Q4. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.3% for the quarter and 26% for the full year 2022, which increased from 15.6% in Q4 2021 and 17.3% in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the impact of R&amp;D capitalization requirements. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million.Moving to segment results. I'll start by discussing the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue was $1.07 billion, down 11% year-over-year or down 8% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $687 million was down 13% year-over-year. As expected, growth driven by pull-through on the increased installed base was offset by delayed recruitment for some large research projects in the Americas and Europe, the ongoing impact of COVID disruptions in China, the year-over-year impact of customer inventory management, the anticipated decrease in COVID surveillance revenue and headwinds from foreign exchange rates. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina declined 24% year-over-year to $146 million, driven primarily by the lower NovaSeq 6000 shipments in advance of the availability of NovaSeq X.biotech research company, bio-technology companiesCopyright: mikkolem / 123RF Stock PhotoThe decline was partially offset by another quarter of record NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments, which grew 31% year-over-year as we continue to see strong adoption by new to Illumina customers and demand for our new 2x300 kits that bring longer lead capabilities to our mid-throughput platform for the first time. During the fourth quarter, COVID surveillance contributed approximately $20 million in total revenue, comprised of $19 million in sequencing consumables and $1 million in sequencing instruments. This was in line with our expectations and down $30 million year-over-year, driven primarily by lower sample volumes. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $131 million was up 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as an increase in oncology and IBD partnership revenue.Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas was $577 million, down 7% year-over-year, and EMEA revenue of $301 million represented a 14% decrease year-over-year or a 10% decrease on a constant currency basis. As expected, the base business in both regions was impacted by an anticipation for NovaSeq X and the slowdown in COVID surveillance and research I mentioned earlier. We continue to see strong demand for NextSeq 1000/2000, with record shipments in the Americas up nearly 50% year-over-year, driven by strength across both research and clinical. In addition, NovaSeq Dx shipments exceeded expectations in the first quarter of launch with strong early demand by clinical customers in Europe. Greater China revenue of $94 million represented a 22% decrease year-over-year or a 14% decrease on a constant currency basis.The region continued to be impacted by COVID lockdowns that resulted in lower sample volumes year-over-year. We continue to expect our business in China to be impacted by headwinds from COVID-related disruptions, exchange rates and slowing GDP growth in the region, at least through the first half of 2023. Finally, APJ revenue of $93 million declined 10% year-over-year or 4% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. Strong growth across clinical markets was more than offset by the conclusion of a large research project in Japan and delayed high-throughput instrument purchases due to the introduction of NovaSeq X. Moving to the rest of core Illumina P&amp;L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 67.3% decreased 430 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes.Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $528 million were down $52 million year-over-year, primarily due to cost containment initiatives, lower performance-based compensation expense and a onetime partnership-related expense in Q4 2021. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $23 million for the quarter grew 130% year-over-year, driven primarily by accelerating adoption of Galleri as well as higher contributions from MRD pharma partnerships due to a milestone payment in Q4 '22 that GRAIL does not expect to repeat in Q1 2023. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $166 million and increased $35 million year-over-year, driven primarily by continued investments in clinical trials and to scale GRAIL's commercial organization.Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow provided by operations was $147 million. Fourth quarter 2022 capital expenditures were $88 million and free cash flow was $59 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cash as of the close of the quarter included $991 million in net proceeds from the term notes issued on December 13, 2022, which will be used to repay upcoming debt maturities in 2023. Moving now to 2023 guidance. We expect full year consolidated revenue to grow 7% to 10% to approximately $4.9 billion to $5.03 billion. We expect full year 2023 core Illumina revenue to grow 6% to 9% to approximately $4.83 billion to $4.96 billion.These ranges include an anticipated headwind from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points as well as a year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange rates. We expect quarterly revenue to ramp sequentially through 2023 with linearity trends similar to what we saw in 2017 when we launched the NovaSeq 6000. GRAIL is expected to deliver revenue in the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023, reflecting year-over-year growth of 82% at the midpoint, driven by accelerating adoption of the Galleri test. For fiscal 2023, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 8% year-over-year. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $35 million, which are eliminated in consolidation.We expect core Illumina sequencing instrument growth of approximately 9% year-over-year, driven by the NovaSeq X upgrade cycle and continued momentum in mid-throughput. We expect core Illumina sequencing consumables growth of approximately 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by the NovaSeq X launch as customers build consumables inventory and ramp utilization as well as continued growth in our mid-throughput consumables due to the growing installed base. This growth will be partially offset by further reduced COVID surveillance revenue. We expect annual pull-through for NovaSeq 6000 of approximately $900,000 to $1 million per system in 2023 as customers transition to NovaSeq X. We expect pull-through for NextSeq 1000/2000 in the range of $120,000 to $170,000 per system in 2023 as the record instrument placements in '22 and continued strong placements in 2023 are brought fully online.We expect the remainder of our pull-through ranges to be in line with historical guidance. We also expect revenue from COVID surveillance of approximately $30 million in 2023, which reflects a year-over-year headwind of $105 million or approximately 2 percentage points. We expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 8% in core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22% for 2023. These margins reflect: one, an increase in core Illumina operating expenses from 2022, primarily driven by normalization of our performance-based compensation; two, a temporary decrease in gross margins as we launch NovaSeq X, consistent with what we saw in 2017 when we launched NovaSeq 6000; and three, an increase in GRAIL operating expenses due to the ongoing investments to support the FDA application, NHS trial and to continue to scale GRAIL's commercial organization.We also expect a consolidated non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 36%, which includes an approximately $75 million impact from the R&amp;D capitalization requirements. If these requirements are repealed in 2023, we expect our 2023 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15%. We expect consolidated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.25 to $1.50, which includes dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $670 million. And finally, we expect non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be approximately 160 million shares. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect consolidated revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion for Q1 2023, reflecting a sequential decrease of 212 basis points from Q4 2022 at the midpoint, primarily driven by: historical seasonality of our core business due to year-end budget flushes not repeating in the first quarter; partially offset by an increase in high-throughput instrument shipments due to the launch of NovaSeq X in Q1; and a decrease in GRAIL revenue of approximately $5 million due to a milestone payment in Q4 2022.We expect quarterly revenue to grow sequentially through 2023, driven by a ramp in NovaSeq X shipments and utilization, recovery from COVID disruptions in China, accelerating adoption of Galleri and an expected mitigation of macroeconomic headwinds in the second half of 2023. For the first quarter, we expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 1% and core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17%. We expect operating margins to improve throughout 2023 as revenue ramps and we scale our production of NovaSeq X and leverage the fixed cost of the manufacturing base. We expect net other expense of approximately $9 million, primarily due to the interest expense on our new bond issuances. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of approximately 160 million shares, in line with fiscal 2023.I'll now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks.Francis deSouza: Thanks, Joydeep. Illumina continues to prioritize innovation. We know our customers invest in our road map, not just our instruments. I talked about the NovaSeq X series earlier. The X is a powerful catalyst for 2023 and beyond. We also prioritized sustainability. NovaSeq X features a 90% reduction in packaging waste and weight and a 50% reduction in plastic usage compared to the NovaSeq 6000. The enablement of ambient temperature shipping of reagents will result in nearly 500 tons of dry ice savings per year while significantly reducing waste streams for our customers. These improvements are game changers for our industry. We're also excited to bring long-read capabilities to market through 2 upcoming products in our Illumina Complete Long-Reads offering.Our long-read human whole genome assay will be available in the first half of this year, while the enrichment panel will be available in the second half of this year. We recently announced that our enrichment panel will enable a comprehensive, high-accuracy, long-read view for as low as $600 per genome. More than a dozen customers have evaluated data from their own samples using Illumina Complete Long-Reads and their feedback has been strongly positive. They find Illumina complete long-reads more convenient than other long-read technologies and more straightforward with flexible input requirements. They are impressed with the data accuracy, along with the read lengths and phase blocks that can be generated on Illumina sequencers. Illumina Complete Long-Reads and NovaSeq X will continue to evolve the genomics industry.This year, we will celebrate Illumina's 25th anniversary. Over this quarter century, Illumina has remained at the forefront of a global genomics movement, and we're even more optimistic about the road ahead. We're honored to be driving a global health transformation with our customers. And together, we will seize the potential of the genome era. I'll now invite the operator to open up the line for Q&amp;A.

Which transcription factors affect insulin resistance and halt cancer progression? What is the viral load in one country's estuarine and coastal waters? Researchers posing such questions turn to Admera Health, a laboratory that provides genomic and bioinformatic services. Admera works with thousands of customers across the world-biotech, biopharma, and pharmaceutical companies; universities and university hospitals; nonprofit institutions-whose projects focus on human, animal, and plant health.Forming a combination of ""advanced molecular era"" for its name, Admera Health spun off from Genewiz in 2014 and occupied the clinical space for a few years, providing lab services to healthcare providers looking for insight into how to better treat their patients. Since 2015, Admera has doubled down on sequencing laboratory work in biopharma, mostly at a research level, wielding its strength in science and next-generation sequencing (NGS) expertise. It has retained its CLIA and CLEP certifications and CAP accreditation, which, together with its clinical experience, give Admera an advantage when it comes to maintaining the highest quality care standards and providing guidance to customers.""We're a small company but we use many automated liquid handlers, and a lot of cutting-edge technology to improve efficiency and service quality,"" says Yun Zhao, company CEO and board member. ""The lab itself can hold 70 to 80 people and we've optimized our processes to fully utilize the entire space but with room to continue to scale up.""No limitAdmera begins each project by sitting down with the client to understand their goals-whether it's pushing research toward a clinical trial or helping a biotech company develop drug therapies or drug screenings. Next, they strategize on design.Admera works with all major cancer centers in the US, top pharma companies, and several Ivy League universities. To accommodate such A-list customers and the large volumes of genomic data they entail, they often employ Illumina BaseSpace Sequence Hub. In fact, Admera securely stores copies of its sequencing data in several different places-including BaseSpace Sequence Hub on Amazon Web Services and on a large internal server for long-term storage.Story continues""Storage is very important,"" says Zhao, ""especially when the timeline for a project can span several years. We may deliver analysis and interpretations and then, years later, the customer will ask for additional information.""Zhao's favorite projects are ones that they take from A to Z. ""I get very excited about those,"" he says, reminiscing about one for an animal health client that included compiling a gene list, designing a panel, and processing canine tissue samples.In addition to library prep and sequencing, Zhao is proud of Admera's strong bioinformatics team, which must parse through massive amounts of data. PhD-level scientists work together to analyze and annotate the data in order to provide meaningful analysis to customers performing academic research, pharmaceutical studies, and biotech product research.And of course, the key to doing a job well is having the right tools: When they onboarded the Illumina NovaSeq 6000, Zhao remembers with a smile, ""we placed the order, and within weeks, the first run happened. Illumina did a fantastic job; we were able to put our first batch of samples on the sequencer within 10 days, and our customers already feel the difference. There has been improvement in the turnaround time, the sequencing capacity, and the quality. The high throughput really gives our team immediate access to all the data, which means we can help more with companies that are doing biomarker discoveries and drug screenings. We can have the answers for them much more quickly.""Last fall, Admera placed an order for Illumina's newest sequencer, the NovaSeq X Plus, the week it was announced at the Illumina Genomics Forum. ""This sequencer is really important for us. It is definitely going to help us grow our business,"" says Zhao.""As a company, we've always been growing organically,"" adds Jeff Mitchell, vice president of corporate affairs. ""This is the first time that we're proactively making that investment in ourselves. Even though we're a small company, we're still punching above our weight. Because of our knowledge and the focus on the advanced technologies, we've been able to push the boundaries of our capabilities.""Illumina, Thursday, February 9, 2023, Press release pictureAdmera Health CEO Yun Zhao at the New Jersey offices. | Photo: Jayme ThorntonView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illuminaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/738841/A-New-Era-for-Discoveries-at-Admera-Health]"

210,cdc359e1-95d9-3d0f-9668-f5c161dd3a26,SO,2023-02-10,Analysts Estimate Southern Co. (SO) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-southern-co-report-150003839.html,1675954803,STORY,['SO'],"[Southern Co. (SO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 16, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.24 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%.Revenues are expected to be $6.09 billion, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.45% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern Co.For Southern Co.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southern Co. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Southern Co. Would post earnings of $1.33 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.31, delivering a surprise of -1.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Southern Co. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AVB reported fourth-quarter 2022 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.59, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The figure also improved by 14.1% year over year from $2.27.  The fourth-quarter results reflect a year-over-year increase in same-store residential rental revenues. The same-store average rental revenue per occupied home reported a rise, though occupancy declined.This residential REIT announced a 3.8% hike in the quarterly dividend and provided its initial 2023 outlook. AVB expects its core FFO per share growth to be driven by the stabilized portfolio in 2023.Total revenues in the quarter came in at $669.7 million, almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $670 million. However, revenues rose 11.4% year over year.For the full-year 2022, the core FFO per share came in at $9.79, higher than the prior-year tally of $8.26 but marginally lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.80. This was backed by 13.0% growth in total revenues to $2.59 billion.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, same-store residential rental revenues increased 10.3% year over year to $571.8 million. Same-store residential operating expenses rose 8.2% to $171.6 million. The same-store residential net operating income (NOI) climbed 11.3% to $400.7 million from the prior-year period.Same-store average rental revenue per occupied home rose to $2,861 in the fourth quarter of 2022 from $2,839 in the third quarter and $2,586 in the year-ago quarter. However, the same-store economic occupancy of 95.9% decreased 10 basis points (bps) sequentially and 30 bps year over year.As of Dec 31, 2022, AvalonBay had 17 consolidated development communities under construction (expected to contain 5,417 apartment homes and 56,000 square feet of commercial space). The estimated total capital cost of these development communities at completion is $2.26 billion.Portfolio ActivityIn the fourth quarter, AVB acquired Avalon Highland Creek in Charlotte, NC, for $76.7 million. This is a wholly owned community with 260 apartment homes. During the reported quarter, AVB sold Avalon Park Crest, a wholly owned community containing 354 apartment homes, in Tysons Corner, VA, for $145.5 million, resulting in a gain in accordance with GAAP of $88.16 million.During the quarter, AvalonBay sold two of the 172 residential condominiums at The Park Loggia in New York, NY, for $6.52 million. As of Dec 31, 2022, it concluded the sale of 163 of the 172 residential condominiums for total gross proceeds of $478.7 million.Story continuesBalance SheetAVB had $613.19 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $121.06 million in cash in escrow as of Dec 31, 2022. As of the same date, the company did not have any borrowings outstanding under its $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or its $500 million unsecured commercial paper note program.Additionally, its annualized net debt-to-core EBITDAre for the October-December period was 4.5 times, and the unencumbered NOI for the year ended Dec 31, 2022 was 95%.2023 OutlookFor the first quarter of 2023, AvalonBay expects core FFO per share in the range of $2.47-$2.57. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.59.For 2023, AVB expects core FFO per share between $10.06 and $10.56, indicating a 5.3% increase at the midpoint of $10.31. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same presently stands at $10.51.Management expects same-store residential revenue growth of 4.0-6.0% and an operating expense increase of 5.75-7.25%. Consequently, same-store residential NOI is projected to expand 3.0-5.5%.Dividend RaiseConcurrent with its fourth-quarter earnings release, AvalonBay increased its first-quarter 2023 dividend to $1.65 per share from the $1.59 paid in the prior quarter. This represented a sequential hike of 3.8%. The new dividend will be paid out on Apr 17 to shareholders on record as of Mar 31, 2023.AvalonBay Communities currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

Those are the stark words from former Paramount CEO Barry Diller. I, for the most part, agreed with that grim sentiment this morning. Sure, we still have Marvel movies and the once-every-20-or-so-years epic smash hit from James Cameron. But for the most part, what used to bring my family and yours to the movies is a distant memory.But then came a spark. A light I long thought burned out suddenly flipped on. Who would have thought Amazon was responsible for turning that switch? The trailer for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's upcoming Nike drama, ""Air,"" released, and with it, goosebumps. Watch.- There's nothing cool about Nike.- You would have to have a pretty compelling pitch.[NIGHT RANGER, ""SISTER CHRISTIAN""] Where you going, what you--- I got it.- I found them. Who's that? Jesus?- Can't afford it.- I'm willing to bet my career on one guy.(SINGING) Mama's worrying- My name is Sonny Vaccaro. I'm with Nike.- Do you typically make it a habit of showing up at people's front doors unannounced?- I don't like to take no for an answer.- Oh, man. Here we go.[MUSIC PLAYING]- I need the greatest basketball shoe that's ever been made.- Who's the player?- Michael Jordan.(SINGING) You're motoring.- But the shoe is just a shoe.- Until my son steps into one.DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, if you're not excited for that, something is wrong with you. You don't have a pulse. How about them apples, you might say. The film from Amazon Studios hits theaters April 5th. Affleck plays Nike founder Phil Knight. Matt Damon plays Sonny Vaccaro, as you saw there, the sports marketing legend who signed Michael Jordan. Twenty years after his retirement, the Jordan brand still makes Nike nearly three billion a year, more than a quarter century after ""Good Will Hunting.""Story continuesFifty-somethings Ben Affleck and Matt Damon still get it. What Hollywood seems to have largely forgotten, inspiring, uplifting, true storytelling like Jordan shoes still sells. And just like Jordan's Bulls, this flick has a strong supporting cast. Best Actress Viola Davis, Jason Bateman, who's hysterical, Chris Tucker. They fill out the starting five. This movie just might be my favorite movie in 10 years.I think it's going to be in my top three of all time, and it doesn't come out until April. I just think these are the types of movies that we used to see with our sons and daughters, and they just don't make them anymore, because they've got to be these massive, super hero-type, blockbuster hits. You're not feeling my goosebumps.SEANA SMITH: I am feeling your goosebumps. I'm going to say there's a lot riding on the line with your hype going into this movie. I just hope that it's able to deliver. I love the trailer, though. I am very, very excited for it. Clearly, it's going to be a home run. I think, like, you're talking about Affleck and Damon will largely come out winners on this, but it's also a huge home run for Amazon as well.And I think it could really reshape the streaming game in terms of how they release some of their big movies. We've seen some resistance from Apple, from Netflix in the past, but the pressure is going to be on them to follow suit, I think. Because I do think you're right. I think this is going to be the movie that gets a lot of people back into theaters, people that haven't yet returned from the pandemic, and Amazon clearly is going to come out on top there too.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah. Amazon deserves a lot of credit for courageous, taking on stories like this, that I think can really resonate with an audience. A colleague of mine said, why do you think Michael Jordan wasn't in that trailer? And I said, that was a stroke of genius, because whoever plays Michael Jordan-- And they haven't even told us that. It's not in any of the press releases. That would have been the only thing people concentrated on, because they would have said, that wasn't like the real Michael Jordan I don't think you'll hear him speak much in this film, because that can only disappoint people. OK, I'll stop.SEANA SMITH: Are you going to be able to sleep the night before you go? It doesn't sound like it.DAVE BRIGGS: I will sleep outside the theater--SEANA SMITH: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think--DAVE BRIGGS: --in a sleeping bag--SEANA SMITH: --you definitely will. I think you definitely will. All right. We are all clearly very hyped for this movie.]"

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to emphasize that functionality for the question-and-answer queue will be given at that time. . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.Gabrielle Brown: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings.Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and on our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.Lachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Gabby, and thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter results. Our fiscal second quarter continued to build upon the strength of the first quarter to deliver record first half ratings and revenue at Fox. Financially, we delivered a 4% increase in our top line, including a 4% advertising revenue growth. Our EBITDA grew a massive 71%, principally due to strong advertising results from sports and political as well as the impact of exiting Thursday Night Football. Our television segment led this growth and had a truly stellar performance. The station's group posted another record political midterm cycle, with approximately $250 million booked during the first half of our fiscal year.Story continuesThis is higher than our previous midterm record and just shy of our fiscal '21 presidential year record. These are impressive numbers and reinforce the strength and breadth of our station group. FOX Sports was also a key growth driver this past quarter where advertising, pricing and demand remains solid on the back of viewership records for the NFL and for the World Cup. By every measure, FOX Sports is having an extraordinary year. Fox's domination of the fall was led by four of our most prominent rights packages, the NFL, the Big Ten network, Major League Baseball and FIFA, all coming together to produce a truly powerful schedule. For the fourth straight calendar year, FOX Sports is the industry leader in live events, with some notable achievements that bode well for our future, including the current NFL regular season on FOX averaged over 19 million viewers and finished as the number one NFL package on television.America's Game of the Week averaged just over 24 million viewers and is projected to be the most watched program of all of television for the 14th straight year. And our Thanksgiving game this year was the most watched regular season game ever on any network, delivering 42 million viewers. College Football had its most watched season ever on Fox, led by Big Noon Saturday, which was the most watched college football window for the second straight year, while the annual Ohio State-Michigan rivalry was the most watched regular season college game on any network in 11 years. And, of course, the 2022 Men's World Cup exceeded our expectations with average viewership of over the tournament up 30% from the 2018 matches. We can't wait for the Women's World Cup this summer, and we're already getting ready for the 2026 Men's World Cup here in North America.Of course, the strength of the FOX Sports portfolio was on full display this past Thanksgiving, with our traditional Thanksgiving NFL game, USA versus England in the World Cup, a huge college football game and America's Game of the Week, all spread over just four days. The ratings were impressive, but the revenue we generated was even better. We wrote just shy of $250 million over the long weekend. And the strength of FOX Sports has continued into the current quarter on the back of exciting player football and what will be a record sold out Super Bowl this coming Sunday. At Tubi, we had another strong quarter where ad revenues grew by 25% over last year, as we continue to outperform our peers. We have seen increases in almost every major KPI of Tubi, including CPMs, TVT and engagement.In fact, Tubi had its highest quarterly viewership in this fiscal second quarter, with total viewing time up 41% year-on-year, while December alone was the highest TVT and highest user month ever. These trends have continued early into the third quarter as Tubi add viewers and content to the platform. At FOX Entertainment, Rob Wade has settled into his new role as CEO and has already launched two of the season's biggest hits; Accused, ranked as the most watched debut on any broadcast or cable network in two years, and Special Forces: World's Toughest Test is this season's number one unscripted program. Further, FOX Entertainment recently announced a multiyear extension with Hulu of our longstanding content licensing agreement, which bolsters Fox's streaming audience and provides Hulu with a key point of differentiation in a crowded streaming world.Turning to FOX News media, the FOX News channel ended the second quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and in primetime, while maintaining its lead as the most watched cable news network, beating CNN and MSNBC combined in both total viewers and demo in the quarter for both prime and total day. And the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, beating CNBC in total viewers during the business day and market hours for the third consecutive quarter. FOX Nation accelerated subscriber growth over the last quarter and last year and had the best quarter ever for engagement in terms of hours viewed, no doubt driven by brilliant fresh content like Yellowstone: One Fifty. Looking at the distribution side of our business, we have now completed most of the deals expiring in the first year of our multiyear affiliate renewal cycle.So far the results confirm the confidence we have in monetizing our leading brands and content, and we are pleased that the market recognizes the value that Fox delivers to their offerings. It has been a truly strong quarter, one that showcased the very best of Fox and has shown that the underlying performance of Fox is exceptionally healthy. Looking ahead into this third fiscal quarter, our top line will, of course, be aided by a record Super Bowl. But we are still seeing solid national demand for our news and sports platforms, growth in the Tubi KPIs and we are encouraged to see multiple ad categories pacing strongly positive at our local stations. Before handing the call over to Steve, I want to add some perspective to the Fox story. In the almost four years since the spin, Fox has grown and flourished while pursuing a simple strategy, a core business of trusted brands that delivers consistent and substantial audiences and a portfolio of digital growth initiatives that scale over time.With our focused sports and news franchises, we have taken a differentiated approach, choosing to serve our audience primarily through the pay TV ecosystem, which optimizes the delivery and value of live programming. Our ability to drive our business and execute our strategy is underpinned by a number of accomplishments. For example, our affiliate and advertising revenue growth is driven by our pricing power, reinforced by regularly delivering large scale audiences and uniquely providing exclusive content to our pay TV distributors. This approach has led to nearly $2 billion in affiliate revenue growth and over 1.3 billion in advertising revenue growth since the spin in 2019. By focusing on live content, our core Fox brands have been able to run sharply counter to the broader trend of linear TV.We can see this by looking at consumption trends. Over the past 10 years, consumption of FOX Sports events is up 18% and consumption of FOX News is up 28%. Our portfolio of sports rights is secure and is the best out there, with the vast majority of them locked up for the foreseeable future. Our NFL rights, the single best package in all of television extends to the 2033 season. We just completed the first year of our Major League Baseball extension and renewed our Big Ten rights, which each takes us out through the end of the decade. We have the European Championships through 2028 and another cycle with our FIFA World Cup rights. These long-term rights provide us the visibility and necessary flexibility to plan our businesses and pursue growth opportunities moving forward.On the digital side, we have made calculated investments in areas where we believe we can add significant value. Sports wagering and advertising video-on-demand are the two best examples of this. We have a firm footing in the sports gambling space. We were the first among U.S. media companies to strike a partnership with a betting operator because we see the potential for sports betting to drive engagement, enhance the viewing experience, and keep viewers coming back to FOX Sports linear and digital platforms. The various financial options and investments we have reflect our view that sports gambling is a long-term play and we are focused on cementing our leadership in this rapidly evolving and high growth sector. Tubi, the number one AVOD player, leads our streaming strategy and with minimal investment when compared to our peers.Revenue and engagement KPIs at Tubi have far exceeded our expectations and are consistently growing in the healthy double digit range since we acquired it almost three years ago. The results at Tubi are proof that our strategy is working and we will continue investing in and growing this platform. Finally, I'd like to address the recent announcement regarding News Corporation. As you know, my father and I reached the conclusion that exploring a combination with News Corp. is not optimal for shareholders of Fox or News Corp. at this time. As such, the special committees were disbanded and no further time or action is being taken on this topic. I've said in the past that I think scale provides flexibility and that it's important to be prepared when opportunities present themselves.The rationale behind considering accommodation with News Corp. was about that; scale, flexibility, synergies, opportunities, great IP and above all creating value for all shareholders. As a CEO of Fox, I have never felt more confident about our strategy, the quality of our assets and the strength of our financial position. This confidence is clearly demonstrated by this morning's announcement to increase our share repurchase authorization to $7 billion, with the immediate deployment of $1 billion of the expanded authorization toward an accelerated share repurchase transaction, while continuing our current in-market purchases. Consistent with our track record, we remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner.And we will continue to explore every opportunity to maximize that value over the long term. And now, let me turn it over to Steve for more on the results.Fox, bikeappic-M0TCk5QYsS8-unsplashSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Fox continued to deliver financially in the fiscal second quarter, with total company revenue growth of 4% and 71% growth in EBITDA. Notwithstanding the absence of Thursday Night Football, our overall revenue growth was led by a 4% increase in advertising revenues where in the quarter, we saw continued strength in political advertising of the stations, which when viewed across the full fiscal first half, nearly matched the political record set during the 2020 presidential cycle. Additionally, our sports advertising was supported by a full roster of marquee events and Tubi continued to sustain its high growth trajectory. Our affiliate revenues increased by 1%, with limited renewal activity impacting the quarter and trailing 12 months subscriber losses remaining consistent at approximately 7%.Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $531 million, up $220 million over the prior year. In addition to our revenue growth, we also have benefited from lower expenses as a result of our early exit from the Thursday Night Football agreement. Net income attributable to stockholders was $330 million, or $0.58 per share, up meaningfully against a net loss of $85 million, or negative $0.15 per share, reported in the prior year period. Alongside our growth in EBITDA, you'll recall that our GAAP P&amp;L is regularly impacted by the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter, which we recognize in other net. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, growth was strong with adjusted EPS of $0.48 per share, up $0.35 against last year's $0.13 per share.Turning to our segments. At television, we delivered 6% revenue growth, including a 5% increase in advertising revenues. As you know, our advertising revenues in the December quarter of last year benefited from our coverage of Thursday Night Football. Despite that comparable headwind, we delivered meaningful gains across the segment. This was led by the strong political cycle, the addition of the World Cup at FOX Sports and continued strong growth at Tubi. On the NFL specifically, we also have benefited from strong pricing, a record-breaking Thanksgiving Day broadcast and the timing of Week 18 of the season sliding back into the December quarter. Meanwhile, advertising revenue growth at Tubi was up 25% in the quarter and exceeded $200 million on the back of record levels of engagement.In an uneven programmatic advertising marketplace, we're able to maintain CPMs and are well positioned to deploy more inventory as market conditions strengthen. Television affiliate fee revenues were up 6% as healthy growth in pricing across all Fox affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues increased 26% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the consolidation of the prior year acquisition of MarVista. EBITDA in our television segment was up $529 million to $256 million as we benefited from the strong political market and realized the anticipated financial benefit from the exit of our Thursday Night Football agreement. These benefits were partially offset by higher costs from the World Cup and the annual growth in rights amortization we see across our sports portfolio.Similar to the levels reported in our fiscal first quarter, our net EBITDA investment in Tubi amounted to approximately $50 million in the December quarter. At cable, we saw revenues generally in line with the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were essentially flat. As Lachlan mentioned, we continue to see meaningful pricing gains in national advertising across our leadership brands. Additionally, our national sports networks benefited from the broadcast of the World Cup in the quarter. However, this was offset by a softer direct response marketplace that impacted FOX News Media. Cable affiliate fee revenues were broadly flat coming in at $1.03 billion. As we have signaled previously, we are in the early days of our next distribution renewal cycle where we expect revenue gains to be skewed towards the television segment.Meanwhile, cable other revenues were up 7% in the quarter, once again led by higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. EBITDA in our cable segment was $353 million compared to the $668 million reported last year, largely due to higher costs of the national sports networks led by the World Cup and postseason baseball. Expenses were also elevated at FOX News Media due to the digital investments at nation and weather and higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation. Now turning to cash flow, we're consistent with the normal seasonality of our working capital cycle. We recorded a free cash flow deficit of $610 million in the quarter. This typical first half trend reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and the build-up of advertising related receivables, both of which reverse in the second half of our fiscal year.From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased $550 million by our share buyback program. This takes the total cumulative amount repurchased to $3.15 billion, representing 15% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the program in 2019. In addition, today, we declared a $0.25 semiannual dividend. And as Lachlan mentioned, this morning, we also announced an incremental buyback authorization of $3 billion, taking our total authorization to $7 billion. We will immediately deploy $1 billion of this expanded authorization toward an accelerated share repurchase transaction, while concurrently continuing with our normal course buyback pacing which would see us repurchase $450 million in additional shares across the remainder of the fiscal year.These meaningful capital return measures are enabled by the strength of our financial position where we again closed the quarter with a very robust balance sheet, comprising $4 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby.Gabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investing community.See also Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield and 16 Largest Photography Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(weekdays, 11 PM/ET), developed and launched in 2021 by FOX News Media CEO Suzanne Scott, delivered its most-watched year ever in 2022 and continues to upend the genre, becoming the first late-night show to unseat CBS’ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in viewers since 2017. Gutfeld! was the number one late-night show from August to December 2022.During 2022, Gutfeld! commanded nearly 30% of the late-night audience share in 2022, increasing its audience year over year. Gutfeld! finished 2022 as the second most-watched host in late-night television. The late-night program averaged 2,040,000 viewers (+28%) and 342,000 (+12%) in A25-54, posting double digit gains since 2021 in both categories and topping NBC’s The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live! in viewers. Additionally, Gutfeld! beats all of cable late night in viewers, A25-54 and the younger A18-49 demo, including Comedy Central’s The Daily Show and HBO’s Last Week Tonight and Real Time with Bill Maher. For 2023 thus far, Gutfeld! has continued as America’s second highest-rated late-night host, averaging nearly 2 million viewers and 306,000 in the A25-54 demo.FOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service and has been the number one network in basic cable for the last six years and the most-watched television news channel for more than 21 consecutive years, currently attracting more than 50% of the cable news viewing audience according to Nielsen Media Research.

Additionally, a 2021 Brand Keys Customer Loyalty Engagement Index report stated FOX News leads the news industry in both brand loyalty, engagement, and expectations while a 2022 Brand Keys poll showed FNC dominating morning and evening news in customer loyalty engagement.

With as many as 828 million people affected by hunger in 2021 (46 million more people than in 2020 according to the World Health Organization), evidence suggests that we are moving farther away from meeting SDG 2 to achieve zero hunger.One important and often overlooked component of helping increase food security around the world in a sustainable way is supporting smallholder farmers, who produce about one-third of the world's food supply.Smallholder farmers need technical supportThe responsibility of feeding the world's people isn't an easy one. Smallholder farmers in Latin America face many challenges including climate change, rising production costs and the lack of visibility across their supply chains. Without the tools and technologies that larger producers have, smallholder farmers struggle to remain competitive and sustain their livelihoods.William Balverde is a small producer in Costa Rica, and he is a part of the administration council of a small farming cooperative. ""Climate change is affecting us because here we have a lot of problems with the rain, and we have been affected by plagues and illnesses that we were not even aware of,"" Balverde says. ""It has affected us greatly, and at some moments, production has fallen completely apart.""Fabián Román, President of the Latin American-based nonprofit Plan21 Foundation, says that many agriculture producers face the same issues around the world. ""We also have other problems, such as contamination, access to water, biodiversity,"" Román says. These factors disrupt the production of crops and the ability for small farmers to make a sufficient living.Co-creating a solution with technologyThe key to sustainable agricultural transformation lies in enabling smallholder farmers to harness the power of data. In a perfect world, these farmers will be able to make decisions with more accurate data and tools to manage their crops more sustainably and productively. This means that to help smallholder farmers, we must eliminate barriers that prevent them from accessing these critical insights. Through the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, a pro bono social impact program working to help populations most vulnerable to environmental threats, IBM and Plan21 have teamed up to co-create a solution.Story continuesHow Plan21 Foundation and IBM Are Empowering Farmers in Latin AmericaTogether with developers from the Costa Rica Institute of Technology, Plan21 and IBM aim to help smallholder farmers in Latin America to manage their crops more sustainably with the goal of increasing their productivity and income. Volunteer IBMers like Paola Simonetti, an IBM corporate social responsibility project manager, are supporting the development of a customized mobile application, YvY, that provides farmers with technical training to make use of insights from weather data, agronomic data and carbon footprint calculations that facilitate production management and allow better adaptation to climate change.One important component of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator is the configuration of IBM resources and technology to help participants meet their community and environmental impact goals. Plan21's project utilizes IBM's cloud and climate data from the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, which Román says is very impactful.""The IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite allows us to provide short-term climate predictions and extended predictions related to the production of the crops, agronomical data and valuable data to make informed decisions that allow the small producers to make better day-to-day decisions in Latin America,"" says Román.Looking aheadThe collaboration has already begun to show promising results. One hundred ninety farmers are in initial testing in Costa Rica, with over 1,300 farmers to pilot the solution in 2023 in Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Argentina. A total of seven farmer co-operatives have been involved in testing the solution, increasing yields of crops such as coffee, yuca, bananas and cacao. However, there is still much to be done.Natalia Viquez is one IBMer working with Plan21 as a Project Manager for the YvY app. ""The plan for the YvY project for the next year will be to develop new modules that will help small agriculture producers in Latin America and give them accessibility, whether it is by co-ops or independent producers in different countries in Latin America,"" says Viquez. ""We are hoping for an estimate of 1,600 producers, but hopefully we can add more producers.""The collaboration between IBM and Plan21 is key to what YvY means today and what it will be in the future, according to Román.""We are an organization that functions with a team of volunteers. We are not a technology company or technology organization,"" says Román. ""However, we understand technology is essential to contribute and build sustainable processes, and that is why IBM's support is essential.""Progress in the fight against food insecurityYvY has shown small producers that the technology they thought was once impossible to obtain could now be turned into a reality. But to help increase food security around the world, our work to support smallholder farmers cannot stop here. And with the power of science, technology and partnerships, the potential to make a true difference for communities around the world is bright.Learn how IBM makes a positive impact on populations at risk to environmental threats including climate change, extreme weather and pollutionView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/738808/The-Fight-for-Food-Security-Must-Empower-Smallholder-Farmers]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.01 billion, suggesting 5.7% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.For fourth-quarter earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at 45 cents, suggesting flat results from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has moved down 4.3% in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 revenues is pegged at $42.9 billion, suggesting 10.9% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. For 2022 earnings, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $2.48, suggesting growth of 6.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

The company’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales. Underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels are also expected to have bolstered the performance.The company’s volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to have benefited from the ongoing recovery in markets. Category-wise, volume has been benefiting from growth in trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories.Coca-Cola’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The company has been witnessing a splurge in e-commerce with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. KO has been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities. The company has been consistently strengthening consumer connections and piloting various digital-enabled initiatives through fulfillment methods to capture the online demand, which are likely to have boosted fourth-quarter sales.However, Coca-Cola has been witnessing pressures from higher supply-chain costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. The pressures from input cost inflation and other costs are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the fourth quarter.Coca-Cola has been investing in its markets and brands to support sales growth with higher spending on consumer-facing activities. This has led to higher marketing investments in the past few quarters. Higher marketing spending and an increase in short-term incentives and stock-based compensation are expected to have led to increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected adverse currency rates to hurt the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter. It expects a currency headwind of 8% on comparable revenues and 9% on comparable earnings per share for the fourth quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Coca-Cola this time around.

Our senior autos reporters, Pras Subramanian here, with a look at Lucid, because shares closing the day in the red. And let's take a look at where Lucid is closing. I believe they're closing in the red today as the company announces--- Yeah. Quite a bit.- Yeah. Quite a bit. As the company announces that it will provide electric vehicle discounts for two EV models that priced above the threshold for a government subsidy. Pras, when we talk about the strategy here, clearly, they're trying to boost demand. Now, these are for vehicles that don't even come close to what that federal subsidy would be, right?- Yeah. I mean, they're giving you this-- if you can't get the credit, they'll give it to you, right? $7,500, but funded by Lucid themselves for two miles. The Lucid Touring and the Grand Touring, both starting over $100,000. So yeah, you're not going to get it for that, usually. But hey, they'll give it to you now because they want to boost sales, and they'll take the hit financially right now in order to get more-- the car in more people's hands.But the thing ends end of March, which is interesting date because that's when the new battery requirements come into place potentially by Treasury. And there's thought that once those new requirements are in place, no car will be able to get that tax credit. So they're just going to go with the flow till March 31 and then take that hit, sell more cars. Then when it goes away for everybody, they'll be fine.- I'm not sure on the top end. You're talking about the Touring and the Touring Grand, 107, 138. If you're spending that in a car, I'm not sure you care about 7 grand. But I'm just curious about the stock falling almost 11% on this should be good news. We saw it really benefited Tesla. What do you make of the stock drop?Story continues- I mean, the problem is they don't make enough-- they don't make any money, really, on their cars so far. They're all negative-- it's all negative margins.- So goodbye, margins. They're already gone.- Whatever you had are going to be hit by 7,500 bucks each. I mean, that's like 8%, right? If not less. So it's not a good thing for them. But they're just willing to take the hit. They have money to burn for now, at least, and just trying to get more cars into the hands of owners.- Well, Pras, another story that we are watching in the auto space is GM. They have a new chip-making partner. What is happening here? And how big of-- I guess, an improvement could this potentially be for GM's inventory?- GM didn't suffer that badly last quarter with regard to chip prices, but now they're kind of taking matters into their own hands there with the exclusive deal with GlobalFoundries, chips made in the US in upstate New York. They're calling it the capacity corridor for GM's chips. Huge for GM here because they're getting these chips that they say they might need a double amount for in a couple of years because they want to reduce the complexity, use simpler chips, more of them in their products.And it's also a big win for Joe Biden, right? President's Chips Act here. Also Senator Schumer. He's a co-sponsor of the bill. He also talked about touting the Empire State region as an area for chip building. A few couple details that we're not hearing about, the amount of money invested in the factory. They didn't say what that was going to be.We didn't hear about chip capacity. But we do know that GlobalFoundries invested something like $15 billion in that upstate plant in New York. So really bringing home a lot of that chip building here as opposed to building it elsewhere.- And Pras, do you also think that this might be the start of something more when you talk about some of the competitors out there who have also had some supply issues? Maybe they will be turning to more manufacturers inside the US.- Yeah. Why isn't Ford doing this, right? Maybe they will. Maybe they will do it soon. Because they have a ton of cars built in the US coming online soon 2024, 2025. So why wouldn't you line up a chip deal with one of these manufacturers and then use the US incentives to build that factory here?- What is the analyst reaction been so far just in terms of the fact that these automakers are still struggling with supply issues at this point? And we're almost three years since the start of the pandemic.- It's funny. A lot of the analysts-- it seems to me the analyst chatter is that they take the automakers at their word, that they will be able to supply these 100,000, 500,000, even a million vehicles by 2025. But you have to wonder, A, where do you get the materials for the batteries and, B, are there enough chips there?I think there are enough chips. I think it's more of a battery issue. So I think analysts are saying-- this is a good thing for GM. It's a good sign that they want to take it into their own hands, get their own chip supply direct from them, exclusive to them. So I think it's smart. I think you'll see more manufacturers do that potentially in the future.- All right, Pras. Good stuff. Appreciate that.]"

The chips will come from a GF chip facility in upstate New York, which the companies say will fuel a dedicated “capacity corridor” for GM’s chip supply.“We see our semiconductor requirements more than doubling over the next several years as vehicles become technology platforms,” said Doug Parks, GM EVP of global product development, purchasing and supply chain, in a statement. “The supply agreement with GlobalFoundries will help establish a strong, resilient supply of critical technology in the U.S. that will help GM meet this demand, while delivering new technology and features to our customers.”GM says the agreement supports its strategy of actually reducing the number of “unique” chips needed for its vehicles, but increasing overall supply and adding more predictability to its chip supply.“GF will expand its production capabilities exclusively for GM’s supply chain, enabling us to strengthen our partnership with the automotive industry and New York State, while further accelerating automotive innovation with U.S.-based manufacturing for a more resilient supply chain,” said Thomas Caulfield, president and CEO of GF.Malta, NY-based GF had previously said it has invested over $15 billion into its facility in upstate New York, and will likely be investing more for GM’s needs.Investing in more chip manufacturing is win for President Biden stemming from his CHIPS Act, legislation that will encourage chipmakers to move manufacturing to the U.S. It’s also a win for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer — co-sponsor of the CHIPS act - who has been championing chip making in the state for some time.“I have long said that Upstate New York’s semiconductor corridor will be a major engine powering America’s technological future, and now ‘Made in New York' chips will help jumpstart the next generation of vehicles for GM across the country,” Sen. Schumer said.Story continuesGM and GF did not disclose any details on what kind of investment is being made by both sides, and how many chips the deal will supply while in effect.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

""Thus far in January we have seen the strongest orders year to date ever in our history,"" Musk said.That sent shares soaring the next day, and the steady climb hasn’t stopped. Add in last week’s FOMC meeting where Fed Chair Jay Powell’s use of the term “disinflation” gave tech stocks and the general market a lift on hopes of easing rates, and Tesla shares are steadily climbing past $200.The next big catalyst for Tesla will be the automaker’s Investor Day on March, at which Musk has said he will unveil his Master Plan 3, which will detail his “path to a fully sustainable energy future for Earth.”The all-new, three-row 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander is shown during world premiere event at Chicago Auto Show on February 8, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. - Japanese automaker Toyota said Thursday, February 9, 2023, its net profit for the third quarter fell eight percent, but it left its full-year forecasts unchanged. The world's top-selling carmarker, which reshuffled its top executive line-up last month, reported a net profit of 727.9 billion yen ($5.6 billion), down from 791.7 billion yen a year earlier. (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI / AFP) (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images)Toyota reports earnings and revenue beatToyota (TM) shares are also climbing higher today, as the world’s largest automaker reported a beat on both the top and bottom lines earlier today.For Toyota’s fiscal Q3, the company reported revenue of $74.6 billion (9.755 trillion yen) that topped estimates, and net profit - $5.54 billion (727.94 billion yen), also topping analyst expectations.Toyota did report that margins shrank a bit, to 9.8%, as the company said higher selling and administration costs were to blame. And the chip crisis is still impacting operations, with the company saying in a statement that it is “striving to quickly evaluate alternative semiconductors and respond to design changes for securing stable procurement of semiconductors.”Story continuesDespite this, the automaker maintained its sales forecast of 10.4 million vehicles for the fiscal year, and expects revenue to increase 15% for the year, though net profit is expected to fall 17% compared to a year ago.Lastly, Toyota only sold 12,000 EVs globally in its fiscal Q3, a fraction of what competitors like GM, Ford, and not to mention Tesla sell every quarter. Though nearly 28% of Toyota sales are comprised of hybrids as well as EVs, the company needs to ramp up its EV efforts before it falls further behind other competitors.This is perhaps a reason why CEO Akio Toyoda is stepping down from his position in April, to be replaced by Lexus head Koji Sato. Toyoda, whose grandfather started the automaker, will be installed as chairman of the board.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE: GM) and GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) (GF) today announced a strategic, long-term agreement establishing a dedicated capacity corridor exclusively for GM’s chip supply. Through this first-of-its-kind agreement, GF will manufacture for GM’s key chip suppliers at GF’s advanced semiconductor facility in upstate New York bringing a critical process to the U.S.This agreement supports GM’s strategy to reduce the number of unique chips needed to power increasingly complex and tech-laden vehicles. With this strategy, chips can be produced in higher volumes and are expected to offer better quality and predictability, maximizing high value content creation for the end customer.Semiconductors are the foundation of the technologies that are powering the electrification, autonomous driving and connectivity of the auto industry, and they have been center stage in the global chip shortage that has impacted automakers the last couple of years.“We see our semiconductor requirements more than doubling over the next several years as vehicles become technology platforms,” said Doug Parks, GM executive vice president of Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain. “The supply agreement with GlobalFoundries will help establish a strong, resilient supply of critical technology in the U.S. that will help GM meet this demand, while delivering new technology and features to our customers.”“At GF we are committed to working with our customers in new and innovative ways to best address the challenges of today’s global supply chains,” said Dr. Thomas Caulfield, president and CEO of GF. “GF will expand its production capabilities exclusively for GM’s supply chain, enabling us to strengthen our partnership with the automotive industry and New York State, while further accelerating automotive innovation with U.S.-based manufacturing for a more resilient supply chain.”Story continues“This first of its kind agreement between GlobalFoundries and General Motors is going to drive the Capital Region economy forward and ensure Upstate New York remains in the driver’s seat as one of the nation’s leading hubs for semiconductor manufacturing that is so critical to the supply chain of the auto industry. I have long said that Upstate New York’s semiconductor corridor will be a major engine powering America’s technological future, and now ‘Made in New York' chips will help jumpstart the next generation of vehicles for GM across the country,” said U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer. “Thanks to my CHIPS and Science Act, we are bringing manufacturing back to our country and America’s supply chains are being secured, creating good-paying jobs here in Upstate New York, not overseas. This partnership is yet another example that our nation’s future will be built in Upstate New York, with the Capital Region as a global center for the future of the microchip industry.”New York Governor Kathy Hochul said: “We’re making New York State not only the semiconductor capital of the country — but of the globe. This agreement will help to further establish New York State as a major hub for semiconductor manufacturing. With our nation-leading Green CHIPS legislation and the new Governor’s Office of Semiconductor Expansion, Management, and Integration, we are helping businesses like GM and GlobalFoundries expand the chips manufacturing ecosystem in our state, creating jobs and opportunities for generations to come.”GF is responding to the global demand for semiconductors through a series of strategic long-term agreements with existing and new customers and simultaneously expanding global capacity to meet customer demand in partnership with federal and local governments. Supportive policies like the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act are encouraging the onshoring of semiconductor production and reestablishing the U.S. as a global leader of this critical technology.About General Motors (NYSE:GM) is a global company focused on advancing an all-electric future that is inclusive and accessible to all.

""I am confident that they are committed to making Project Phoenix and our new Segment-based operating model a major success.”In January, Saligram unveiled a cost-cutting plan dubbed Project Phoenix that will see a 13% reduction in office positions. Newell owns over 100 brands, selling everything from Sharpie pens to Rubbermaid food containers to Coleman camping gear across three segments.Saligram joined a struggling Newell in July 2019 after leading Ritchie Bros and OfficeMax in the CEO capacity.

Westrock Coffee Company, LLC roasts, produces, and distributes coffee. The US$952m market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of US$46m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$56m leading to an even wider gap between loss and breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Westrock Coffee Company will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. View our latest analysis for Westrock Coffee Company Consensus from 4 of the American Food analysts is that Westrock Coffee Company is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2022, before generating positive profits of US$16m in 2023. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 12 months from now or less. We calculated the rate at which the company must grow to meet the consensus forecasts predicting breakeven within 12 months. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 106% is expected, which is rather optimistic! If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Westrock Coffee Company given that this is a high-level summary, though, bear in mind that generally a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.Before we wrap up, there’s one issue worth mentioning. Westrock Coffee Company currently has a relatively high level of debt. Typically, debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in Westrock Coffee Company's case is 80%. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:There are too many aspects of Westrock Coffee Company to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – Westrock Coffee Company's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of essential aspects you should further research:Valuation: What is Westrock Coffee Company worth today?

Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero with the latest. Dani, what are we learning?DANI ROMERO: Yeah. So there's a big picture going on right here. So it is the fact that workers still have the upper hand. And on Wednesday, we learned that two unions reached a voluntary agreement with CSX Transportation. And it really shines a light that the fact that these union workers, like I said, still have the upper hand. And I want to make it clear that this voluntary agreement was on behalf of CSX Transportation, not the union side.And so the deal includes four paid sick days and four-- excuse me-- three paid personal days per year. It also impacts about 5,000 union workers. But if we backtrack just a little bit, like you said, President Biden signed legislation last year to avert any form of a rail strike. So the fact that this current agreement really was on the table. And it was a voluntary agreement on the railroad operator side really does move the dial a little bit for these unions.And so from industry experts I've spoken to, it also gives it a little bit more pressure possibly that other railroad operators will join in and jump on the same bandwagon and offer these incentives to these rail unions. And so so far, Union Pacific, BNSF, and Norfolk Southern do not currently offer workers any paid sick leave. But that doesn't mean that later on, like I said, that they would offer these worker benefits. But it also does possibly signal that CSX Transportation is really trying to find more workers. And so they're trying to incentivize. And this could be some way of doing that.- Certainly sounds like a step in the right direction. Dani, this week, we also heard from President Biden during his State of the Union address that his administration is once again pushing, advocating for family leave. When you talk about the progress here on the rail worker talks, does that help that narrative that the Biden administration is now pushing when it comes to family leave?DANI ROMERO: Yeah, Seana. You do bring up a really good point. This narrative really does add to the Biden administration's narrative of being pro-union. It also gives the administration a leg up. And so if we go back to the State of the Union address, Biden advocated for more worker benefits, and specifically around family leave. But he did not propose any legislation in the future or any current legislation for that matter that would really tackle worker benefits. So if there is going to be a change, it probably would come from the state and local level. But, again, this really is a progress for the union side and also for the railroad operators themselves.- It certainly is progress. All right. Dani Romero, thanks so much.]"

(NYSE:RCL) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 7, 2023Operator: Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Royal Caribbean Group's Fourth Quarter Full Year 2022 and Business Update Earnings Call. I would now like to introduce Michael McCarthy, Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. McCarthy, the floor is yours.Michael McCarthy: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 business update conference call. Joining me here in Miami are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International. Before we get started, I'd like to note that we're making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors.We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our website and in our earnings release available at www.rclinvestor.com. Jason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business. Naftali will follow with a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results and an update on our latest actions and on the current booking environment. We will then open the call for your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason.Jason Liberty: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Before getting started, and on behalf of the entire Royal Caribbean Group organization, 100,000 proud, I want to express how happy we are that our business has returned to normal. In fact, as you saw in the release this morning, our business is accelerating. So let me get into the detail and start off by talking about the fourth quarter and the full year 2022. As highlighted on Slide 6, 2022 was a challenging but successful transitional year as we returned our business to full operations and delivered memorable vacations to 6 million guests. As you can see on Slide 7, during the fourth quarter, demand for our brands accelerated. We delivered a record 1.8 million vacations, achieved a 95% load factor and successfully returned to Australia for the first time in three years.Story continuesPricing for our vacation experiences was higher than record 2019 levels when we operated with normalized occupancy and guest satisfaction scores were exceptional. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted loss per share were above our expectations and at the high end of our guidance. It is incredible to consider that just one year ago, we were in the midst of Omicron, we were still returning our ships to service, and we were sailing at load factors below 60%. Our fourth quarter results clearly demonstrate that we are back, back to usual occupancy, back to our full addressable market, back to EBITDA and cash flow profitability, back to providing full year guidance and most importantly, back to delivering a record number of incredible vacations on the most innovative fleet in the industry.We finished 2022 on a high note and are entering 2023 with the full strength of our operating and commercial platforms. Our strong book position along with the normalization of the booking window provides the visibility needed for us to resume annual guidance, which is in line with our Trifecta program. I am incredibly thankful and proud of everyone at the Royal Caribbean Group for executing so well on our mission of delivering the best vacation experiences responsibly and building the foundation for our future growth. There has been a lot of talk about the state of the consumer, so I want to share what we are seeing from daily interactions with consumers who are either booking their dream vacations or who are currently sailing on one of our amazing ships.Overall, we continue to see robust demand, financially healthy, highly engaged consumers that are excited to sail on our brands. Secular tailwinds continue to benefit us as consumer preferences shift from goods to experiences. Entertainment and travel spend remains strong and the job market continues to show resilience. Consumer sentiment has improved and banks have recently reported healthy savings and continued resilience in credit card spending. Our addressable market is larger than in 2019 and continues to grow. Our products appeal to a broad range of vacationers with everything from a short getaway to Perfect Day to a luxury world cruise. Cruising remains an exceptionally attractive value proposition. And as I have said in the past, it is too attractive, and we are working very hard every day to close that gap.Growth in cruise search has outpaced general vacation searches, resulting in double the number of visits to our websites compared to 2019. Our brands are attracting new customers into our vacation ecosystem with fourth quarter new-to-cruise and new-to-brand mix above 2019 levels. We are constantly enhancing our commercial capabilities so we can further capture quality demand. Approximately 60% of our guests book some of their onboard activities in advance of their cruise, representing double-digit growth in pre-cruise purchase penetration when compared to 2019 at significantly higher rates. As we have said before, every dollar a guest spends before the cruise translates into about $0.70 when they sail with us and over double the overall spending when compared to other guests.Our guests are now engaging with us to book onboard activities much earlier than in 2019. So far, guests booked on 2023 sailings purchased onboard experiences an average of more than two months earlier than in 2019. This translates into more revenue, stickier bookings and happy guests. Now I'll provide some insight into the demand environment and what can only be described as a record-breaking WAVE season. As you can see on Slide 8, bookings outpaced 2019 levels by a very wide margin throughout the fourth quarter with particularly strong trends during Cyber Weekend. We expected a strong WAVE season, but what we are currently experiencing has exceeded all expectations even when considering our capacity growth. As a result, and as highlighted on Slide 9, the seven biggest booking weeks in our company's history all occurred since our last earnings call.Our commercial apparatus is full speed ahead, and all channels are delivering quality demand above 2019 levels. Our direct-to-consumer channels continue to perform exceptionally well as a combination of consumer preference for digital engagement and our enhanced capabilities is supporting record level bookings. We are also encouraged that our strong base of loyal travel partners continues to recover and supporting our brands with bookings above 2019 levels. As always the case, trends vary by region. We are seeing particularly strong booking trends for North American-based sailings, which account for nearly 70% of our capacity this year. From a cumulative standpoint, these itineraries are now booked at the same load factor as they were in 2019 and at higher prices.Our 2023 European sailings are booked within historical ranges at better rates with recent bookings outpacing 2019 levels. We expect almost 80% of our guests to come from North America as we continue to see particularly healthy demand from that region. Our global brand's appeal and nimble sourcing models allow us to continuously shift sourcing to the highest-yielding guests. I will now comment on our outlook for 2023. In 2023, we expect to deliver amazing vacation experiences to over 8 million guests at record yields as we deploy our best-in-class fleet across the best global itineraries. The ramp-up of our load factors in 2022, coupled with a higher and improving pricing environment, is positioning us to fully recover our yields beyond 2019 levels in the first quarter, which is another important milestone, and then ramp up further to record levels as we return to historical load factors in late spring.Our strong yield growth outlook is driven by the performance of our new hardware, strong demand for our core products and continued growth from onboard revenue areas. This year, we expect to increase capacity by approximately 14% compared to 2019 with eight new ships already introduced since 2019 and three more set to be delivered this year. Each of our wholly owned brands will welcome a new vessel in 2023. Silversea will welcome Silver Nova, the first of the Evolution class. Celebrity Cruises, will welcome the fourth Edge series ship, Celebrity Ascent. And Royal Caribbean International will take delivery of Icon of the Seas, marking the first new ship class for the brand in nine years, which is sure to set a new standard for vacation experiences.In addition to our incredible new vessels, we plan to launch Hideaway Beach in the fourth quarter of 2023, an adult-only neighborhood, making Perfect Day at CocoCay more perfect and increasing capacity in the island to 13,000 visitors daily. Our journey to deepen the relationship with the customer will continue with 2023. We will further enhance our commerce capabilities to optimize our distribution channels, build a deeper connection with guests and lower customer acquisition costs. We will also further enhance our e-commerce and pre-cruise capabilities and focus on increasing our guest repeat rate and spend. We will continue to excel in the core and drive business excellence in order to increase yields and capture efficiencies across our platform.Our teams have been working hard for over two years to reshape our cost structure and abate what would have otherwise been at least a 25% increase in nonfuel cost per APCD when compared to 2019. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, is expected to grow 4.75% to 5.75% versus 2019. That's versus a three-year benchmark that includes a period of significant global inflation. Our cost outlook for the year includes approximately 210 basis points from lingering transitional costs such as crew movement and additional structural costs such as full year operations of Perfect Day at CocoCay and our new Galveston terminal. Our teams have been committed to controlling costs and enhancing profitability while focusing on delivering the best guest experience. We continue to expect the business to accelerate and allow us to deliver record yield and adjusted EBITDA in 2023.Our proven formula for success remains unchanged: Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls leads to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance. Our ESG ambitions help inform our strategic and financial decisions on a daily basis, ensuring that we always act responsibly while achieving our long-term profitability goals. In 2023, we will continue active efforts towards our target of reducing carbon intensity by double digits by 2025. We also expect to deliver on significant milestones in our decarbonization pathway, including the advanced technologies on our new ships, while also investing in retrofitting our existing fleet with a mission of reducing technology and programs. We will utilize tools to expand supplier diversity and improve our ability to build an exclusive network of suppliers.Cruise ship, Boat, BusinessPhoto by Adam Gonzales on UnsplashWe will further focus on improving diversity, equity and inclusion and ensure our employees are physically and mentally healthy. To wrap up, 2023 sets the foundation for our Trifecta program. Our people are committed to our mission of delivering the best vacations responsibly and doing so while achieving our Trifecta goals. In 2023, we will be hard at work executing on our strategic pillars, focusing on deepening customer relationships, delivering the best hardware and destinations and excelling in the core. The future of the Royal Caribbean Group is bright. I am confident in our growth trajectory and our ability to deliver on our near-term and long-term goals as well as to reach new financial records. And with that, I will turn it over to Naf.Naf?Naftali Holtz: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by discussing our results for the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 10, we reported a net loss of $500 million or loss per share of $1.96 and adjusted net loss of approximately $300 million or per share of $1.12. The results were above our expectations at the high end of our guidance range. Total revenue was $2.6 billion, operating cash flow was $600 million and adjusted EBITDA was $409 million, again, above our expectation and guidance. Fourth quarter outperformance was a result of continued strong demand for our brands vacation experiences, strong close-in bookings at higher prices and continued strength of onboard revenue. Better cost management and favorable timing of expenses across several categories, lower fuel rates, lower customer acquisition cost and lower interest expense also contributed to the financial results.We finished the fourth quarter at 95% load factor with peak December holiday sailings at 110%. Load factors varied by itinerary with the Caribbean averaging 100% in both late season Europe and Australia, which opened in Q4 at just under 90%. Total revenue per passenger cruise day was up 4.5% in constant currency compared to the record fourth quarter of 2019. Net yield was down 7.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 2019, a significant improvement for the 14% decline in Q3 and above our expectation. 2022 closed out as a successful transitional year and we generated $8.8 billion of total revenue, $712 million of adjusted EBITDA and almost $500 million of operating cash flow. I'll now provide an update on our 2023 business. Let's start with capacity.Our overall capacity for 2023 will be about 14% higher than 2019. Nearly 70% of our '23 capacity will sail on North America-based itineraries, about 17% will be in Europe and close to 10% will be in the APAC region. The remaining capacity will operate in a number of other regions, including South America and Antarctica. From a cumulative standpoint, our book load factor remains well within historical ranges and we have meaningfully narrowed the gap to 2019 levels. Overall, our North America-based itineraries, many of which visit the amazing Perfect Day at CocoCay, are booked in line with 2019 for the full year and are ahead for Q2 forward at better rates. Sailings in Europe are booked within historical ranges and are catching up. We have seen improved booking trends for these itineraries so far in WAVE, particularly from the U.S. and the UK.We expect the improvement to continue, supported by our global sourcing model. Constant currency net yields are expected to be higher than 2019 in all four quarters with more growth for Q2 through Q4, when load factors returned to normal. The return to yield growth in the first quarter marks a significant point in our recovery and highlights the resilience of our company, the strength of our brands and the consumers' desire to spend on our amazing vacation experiences. As of December 31, our customer deposit balance was $4.2 billion, which is about $400 million higher than our balance at the end of the fourth quarter in 2019. Shifting to costs. Our teams continue to demonstrate the ability to manage cost pressures while staying focused on our mission of delivering incredible vacation experiences to our guests.Net cruise costs, excluding fuel per APCD increased 3.9% as reported and 4.7% in constant currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Net cruise costs for the fourth quarter included $1.23 per APCD or a 100 basis point impact of transitory costs related to our health protocols and lagging costs relating to fleet ramp-up and crew movements. We expect these transitory costs to substantially dissipate as the majority of our crew has returned and protocols have eased. Our teams have been working constantly for over two years on reshaping our cost structure through operational and distribution efficiencies, and leveraging group scale. We continue to see the benefits further materialize in 2023 to partially mitigate continued inflationary pressures.Regarding fuel. Fuel rates are coming off the highs of last year. We continue to improve consumption and have partially hedged the rate, which is helping us mitigate the volatility and cost of fuel expense. As of today, fuel consumption is 55% hedged for '23 and 10% for 2024. As highlighted on Slide 11, we are resuming annual guidance for the first time in 3 years as we have more visibility into our book of business and the year ahead. We expect net yield growth of 2.5% to 4.5% for the full year. The underlying yield improvement is driven by the performance of new hardware, strong demand for our core products, continued growth from onboard revenue areas, and it also accounts for lower expected load factors versus 2019 levels. We expect yields to ramp up as we will return to historical load factors in late spring such that we achieved record yields and revenue throughout the year.Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 4.75% to 5.75% for the full year as compared to 2019. Our cost outlook reflects our culture of continuous improvement and innovation. Now let's remember that we are comparing cost figures to a three-year-old benchmark, including a period of high global inflation. We expect that NCCx also includes 210 basis points of lagging transitory and structural costs. Inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions continue to put pressure on costs across many categories, including food and beverage, airfare and shoreside human capital. Our teams continue to find creative ways to manage through inflation and increase profitability. Lastly, costs in the first half of the year are also burdened by more dry dock days during the second half of the year.Fuel expense is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion for the year, and we are 55% hedged at below market rates. Based on current fuel pricing, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect record adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $3 to $3.60. Now turning to Slide 12, I'll provide some color on first quarter capacity and guidance. We plan to operate about 11.2 million APCDs during the first quarter with load factors at 100%. Let me break down first quarter capacity expectations a little more. During the quarter, approximately 80% of our capacity will operate from North America, mostly sailing to the Caribbean. This is higher than in the first quarter of 2019, particularly for short Caribbean sailings, and we have added more capacity in the region to capitalize on the incredible Perfect Day at CocoCay which was not yet opened three years ago.10% of our capacity is in Australia, close to 5% is in Asia and the remainder spread across multiple other itineraries. Based on current currency exchange rates, fuel rates and interest rates, we expect adjusted loss per share of $0.65 to $0.85. Net yields are expected to be up 1% to 2% versus 2019 in constant currency. We are excited to finally recover our yields to record 2019 levels and continue to work hard at further growing our yields and revenues as occupancy level normalizes. On the cost side, overall, we expect our net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to be up approximately 8.5% compared to '19. Similar to the full year guidance, the first quarter carries 320 basis points of transitory costs, structural costs and timing of expenses that are weighing on NCCx when compared to the first quarter of 2019.Shifting to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in liquidity. Our liquidity remains strong, and we are focused on expanding our margins to further enhance EBITDA and free cash flow. Our ultimate goal is to return the balance sheet to an investment-grade profile. During the fourth quarter, we repaid $600 million of debt maturities and closed on the refinancing of $2 billion of secured and guaranteed debt previously due June 2023. Additionally, in January, we successfully extended $2.3 billion of our existing revolver credit facility commitment to April 2025. Our access to capital remains strong, and our execution and performance resonate with our investors and financial partners. We will proactively and methodically continue to manage near-term maturities and improve the balance sheet.For 2023, our scheduled debt maturities are $2.1 billion, made up of predominantly ECA debt amortization, which we expect to pay down with cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations. Our business continues to accelerate, and we expect to grow yields and control costs, such as we achieved record yields and adjusted EBITDA in 2023 as we regained the tremendous profitability of our business. Our strong book position and enhanced commercial capabilities provide further visibility into 2023 and remain committed and focused on executing our strategy and delivering our mission while achieving the Trifecta goals. With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a Q&amp;A session.See also 12 Safe Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 16 Largest Photography Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Real Estate Companies in the World.The global real estate industry involves the buying, selling, and management of properties such as residential homes, commercial buildings, and industrial spaces. It is a complex and diverse industry that includes a wide range of participants, including real estate agents and brokers, property developers, landlords and property managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and financial institutions. As is true for most other industries, the world of real estate is prone to influence by a number of factors, including economic conditions, demographic trends, government policies, and technological advancements. Following a pandemic-fueled course correction, the global real estate industry faces transformational shifts in how buildings will be used, valued, and transacted in 2023 and beyond. This is evidenced by Deloitte's 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook, which revealed that only 40% of global real estate chief financial officers (CFOs) expected to finish 2022 with higher revenues than last year, and 33% anticipated cuts to expenses, citing sustained high inflation, workforce management, and cyber as the top risks to financial performance.According to a report by GrandViewResearch, the global real estate market size was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030. The market is expected to grow at a healthy pace during the forecast period, owing to the rising population and a desire for personal household space. As of 2021, the commercial real estate space was estimated to be the most important element driving industry expansion. Additionally, in terms of revenue, rental real estate types dominated the market with a share of 52.1% in 2021. This is attributable to rising home prices in developed countries, owing to which there is a rise in the number of renters, favoring the segment growth.Story continuesThe pandemic caused significant changes in consumer demand, which led retailers to modernize their systems to better adapt to these changes. This includes improved analytics and strategies to maintain customer loyalty in response to changing consumer preferences. This holds especially true for Gen Z as it is highly dependent on technology and relies more on the internet and social media to make purchasing and lifestyle decisions. Since Gen Z has experienced technology their entire lives, leasing and marketing campaigns for real estate services should incorporate the use of technology to reach this generation where they are most active, which includes social media, or any other internet source.20 Most Valuable Real Estate Companies in the Worldjason-dent-w3eFhqXjkZE-unsplashOur Methodology We used stock screeners to identify the most valuable real estate companies in the world based on market capitalization as of February 1, 2023.

Profits across News Corp’s portfolio of property websites, which includes Realtor.com in the US and Realestate.com.au in Australia, slumped by 28pc.Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp, said: “Obviously, a surge in interest rates and acute inflation had a tangible impact on all of our businesses.“But we believe these challenges are more ephemeral than eternal. Just as our company passed the stress-test of the pandemic with record profits, the initiatives now underway, including an expected 5 percent headcount reduction, or around 1,250 positions this calendar year, will create a robust platform for future growth.”The figures mark the first set of results since Mr Murdoch abandoned plans to reunite the two strands of his empire through a merger of News Corp and Fox Corporation.News Corp and Fox were split in 2013, with most of Fox’s entertainment assets being sold to Disney in a blockbuster $71bn deal in 2019.The media mogul floated the idea of a tie-up last year, but called off the plans in January following a backlash from investors.The Murdoch family’s attempt to merge the two businesses cost News Corp $6m over the period, reflecting the cost of advisors and convening a special committee to assess the deal.News Corp joins a growing list of major US businesses that have announced job cuts in recent weeks.

With 87% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$13b last week. However, the 22% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Snap-on. View our latest analysis for Snap-on ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Snap-on?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Snap-on. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Snap-on's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Snap-on is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.8% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Nicholas Pinchuk is the owner of 1.2% of the company's shares.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Snap-onThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Snap-on Incorporated. Insiders own US$227m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

284,8e7d8f88-c60d-39d3-a33f-ffabf58301c7,SNA,2023-02-10,All You Need to Know About Snap-On (SNA) Rating Upgrade to Strong Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-snap-sna-rating-upgrade-170005887.html,1675962005,STORY,['SNA'],"[Snap-On (SNA) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Snap-On basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Snap-On imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Snap-OnThis tool and diagnostic equipment maker is expected to earn $17.09 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 1.6%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Snap-On. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Snap-On to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That division is now delving deeper into the meetings and events sector as corporate travel recovers.The unit’s boss thinks meetings platforms have become “commoditized,” so he’s now developing a range of features designed to better blend the worlds of virtual and real-life.“Meetings is meetings,” said Chris Lewter, general manager of BlueJeans by Verizon. “It’s a bit of commoditization right now. Everyone kind of does meetings, it just depends who you prefer, or who your company is using.”His comments follow a recent Deloitte report that found “inadequate conferencing software” was boosting the recovery of corporate travel, with conferences now one of the top purposes for a business trip.Hybrid Work FocusThe meetings sector is realigning itself after the pandemic. First came the layoffs, now come the mergers and acquisitions. Cvent is reportedly for sale, while Convene has just bought conference provider etc.venues to cater to the growing trend of hybrid work.It’s this area that BlueJeans is keen to explore, following a launch of products over recent months.“What we’re wrestling with is you’ve got on a Wednesday or Tuesday, or whenever people are coming together, they’re in a conference room, but then you’ve got four other people who never made it to the conference room,” said Lewter. “They’re on the team, they need to be engaged, be part of the conversation and feel that inclusion. That’s where we’re thinking of different versions of the platform.”To address this BlueJeans partnered with Owl to build a 360-degree camera. When placed in the middle of a table it automatically follows the speakers. It also offers “rooms-as-a-service” to help companies upgrade conference rooms, and a “Gateway” device lets companies plug in different video conferencing software, including Microsoft Teams and Zoom, to create a single meeting.Story continuesIt’s also targeting the exhibition sector with a product called Expo, offering booths with a virtual presence so delegates can still attend. On a bigger scale it’s recently developed a Studio product, offering TV production quality.“The idea behind physical conferences, we’re going to see a tonne of it in 2023,” said Lewter.SidenotesIn the face of diminished corporate travel sales, one agency has come up with an innovative way to encourage more bookings: a grant.Australia’s Flight Centre Travel Group was severely impacted by the pandemic and is now reviving its “Corporate Travel Grant” program.It is targeting small and medium-sized businesses, and will provide one company with $20,000 worth of benefits, including IHG hotel stays and Hertz car hire. Four runners-up get $7,000 in Virgin Australia travel credit and two of the airline’s Velocity Gold memberships.The catch? Companies need to film a one to two-minute video pitch, explaining what travel means to their business, and what the grant would allow it to do.As ever, the cost of running the campaign will be a fraction of the value it stands to gain in terms of market research.10-Second Corporate Travel Catch-UpWho and what Skift has covered over the past week: Amadeus, Duetto, EaseMyTrip,  Hertz, Hilton, Icelandair, MGM Resorts,In BriefCWT Raises $90 Million to Fund New Tech DevelopmentCorporate travel agency CWT has raised $90 million in private equity from its shareholders to invest in technology. The investment will “help underpin user-experience, data and reporting, sustainability and myCWT platform enhancements,” it said in a statement Wednesday. More money will be funneled towards sustainability, traveler wellbeing, and inclusivity. That follows investments in real-time carbon footprint indicators, non-binary profile fields, on-trip connectivity, and traveler tracking systems in 2022. Those efforts were part of an arrangement to invest $100 million into its myCWT travel management platform after a hefty financial restructuring.Europe Pushes Ahead With Cross-Border Rail VisionThe European Commission is supporting 10 pilot projects to establish new rail services or improve existing ones to bolster cross-border rail connections. They include European Sleeper, a night train service between Amsterdam and Barcelona which Skift profiled in April 2021. “While demand for green mobility is growing, we need the rail market to respond much better and much faster, especially for long and cross-border journeys,” said European commissioner for transport Adina Valean. A new high-speed train route connecting Paris and Berlin is also planned for 2024.Mobility Platform CMAC Offers Financial Coaching ProgramUK mobility platform CMAC has a new take on employee wellbeing. It believes managing finances can be stressful, especially with the cost of living crisis worsening, so is partnering with Claro Wellbeing to provide a financial advice program for its staff. It offers one-to-one coaching sessions focused on financial confidence, budgeting, retirement planning, investing in property and more. “Worrying about money can lead to increased stress and negatively affect mental and physical wellbeing. From an employer’s perspective, a team member suffering from stress won’t be as productive, they’re likely to take more days off sick and even leave work altogether,” said chief operating officer Neil Micklethwaite.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

It said on Thursday: ""One can expect flight disruptions post the March and July deadlines unless the FAA and the U.S. government take a different approach to this interference issue.""The FAA proposed in January requiring passenger and cargo aircraft in the United States have 5G C-Band-tolerant radio altimeters or approved filters by early 2024. The agency said on Thursday it will evaluate all comments.Concerns that 5G service could interfere with airplane altimeters, which give data on a plane's height above the ground and are crucial for bad-weather landing, led to disruptions at some U.S. airports last year involving international carriers.Verizon Communications Inc and AT&amp;T Inc in June voluntarily agreed to delay some C-Band 5G use until July 2023 as air carriers work to retrofit airplanes to ensure they will not face interference.IATA said the costs are higher per plane than FAA estimated and said it should include the costs of 6,000 planes already retrofitted and non-U.S. registered planes that will be impacted.""Operators around the world are being compelled to invest millions of dollars to retrofit their US-bound fleet while being reliant on the goodwill of companies that refused to accept that 5G C-band interference even existed in the first place,"" IATA said.Story continues""The aviation industry, rather than the (Federal Communications Commission) or the telecommunications companies, is being told to pay to upgrade its certified radio altimeters. The unfairness of this cannot be overstated.""Wireless carries spent more than $80 billion on the C-Band 5G spectrum, including $52.9 billion by Verizon in auction and clearing costs. The FCC, AT&amp;T and Verizon did not immediately comment.On Feb. 2, IATA said many airlines will not meet retrofit deadlines, citing ""supply chain issues, certification delays, and unavoidable logistical challenges.""

We now have access to all capital sources in the debt markets.""Story continues""We have no debt maturities until the second quarter of 2025. Fourth quarter leverage to EBITDAre of 6.05x was $25 million above target due to the timing of share repurchases and the closing of a property sale.""""The strength of our balance sheet enabled us to buy back 8 million shares, 5% of outstanding stock, at a substantial discount to its underlying value.""""In 2023, we expect continued momentum with Same Store Revenue growth of 7.0% to 9.0%, Same Store Expense growth of 5.0% to 6.5%, and Same Store NOI growth of 7.3% to 10.3%.""""Acquisitions play an important part.

Prior to 2022, these amounts were reported on a non-ownership adjusted basis. Amounts may differ from those previously reported.Same Store Markets – Consumer demand remained strong through the quarter, with signed new lease rates up 10.6% from the prior leases and renewals up 8.7%, resulting in a weighted-average increase of 10.2%. We saw a sequential increase in ADO of 120 basis points to 97.1% as the third quarter includes higher frictional vacancy consistent with the higher move out volume that is typical during the summer leasing season. Year-to-date ADO of 97.0% was 70 bps higher than in the prior year. We anticipate maintaining occupancy above 97% through the first quarter before summer leasing activity begins.Acquisition Portfolio – The acquisition portfolio is comprised of five properties acquired in 2021, four properties acquired in 2022, and Southgate Towers, which was our first acquisition of 2023. These acquisitions represent 17% of AIR GAV. We target a 30% allocation to the high-growth Acquisition Portfolio.At those properties acquired in 2021, representing 8% of AIR GAV, leasing continues to exceed expectations with signed blended lease rates up 17.3% in the fourth quarter. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which was the first reporting period with a year-over-year comparison, was more than 50% above the 2022 Same Store portfolio. These properties are included in AIR's Same Store portfolio in 2023, and are expected to increase the rate of Same Store NOI growth by approximately 100 basis points.At properties acquired in 2022, performance is consistent with our expectations, and rental rate achievement is in line with our projections.The impact of the AIR Edge is most significant between the second and fourth year of ownership where we are able to improve the resident profile, optimize the rent roll, and make income generating improvements, which in aggregate are expected to generate an unlevered internal rate of return (""IRR"") of 10% or higher, more than 200 basis points higher than AIR’s cost of capital.Rent Collection UpdateWe measure residential rent collection as the dollar value of payments received as a percentage of all residential amounts owed. In the fourth quarter, residents paid, on a current basis, 98.7% of all residential revenue billed during the quarter. The remaining 1.3% of revenue was treated as bad debt. Gross bad debt, which is bad debt before any consideration of government assistance payments and payments from former residents, was 1.5% of revenue, 100 basis points of which is due to governmental protections in California and court delays in many jurisdictions. Governmental protections in California are now expected to end on March 31, 2023 and the courts across the country are continuing to catch up on a backlog of eviction cases. As a result, we anticipate that AIR's bad debt should continue to normalize throughout 2023 and trend toward our typical loss of approximately 30 basis points of revenue.As of December 31, 2022, our proportionate share of gross residential accounts receivable was $7.6 million. After consideration of tenant security deposits and reserves for uncollectible amounts, our net exposure is below $0.1 million, which we anticipate collecting during the first quarter of 2023.Our accounts receivable balance has decreased from $11.7 million at the beginning of the year, and the number of residents delinquent by two or more months has decreased from 1,000 at the start of 2022 to approximately 250 today, the vast majority of which are now in the collection process.Portfolio ManagementOur portfolio of apartment communities is diversified across primarily ""A"" and ""B"" price points, averaging ""A-"" in quality, and also across eight core markets in the United States. In the two years since the Separation, AIR has recycled approximately $4.1 billion, or 41%, of its gross asset value, all during a period of attractive pricing for multi-family properties, using $2.2 billion of gross proceeds from property sales and joint ventures to reduce leverage and to acquire $1.9 billion of acquisitions to improve the quality and expected profitability of our real estate portfolio. The $1.9 billion of acquisitions in the last two years, inclusive of the Southgate Towers, represents 17% of AIR GAV. We target a 30% allocation to this high-growth Acquisition Portfolio.AIR uses ""paired trades"" to fund acquisitions, basing our cost of capital on the anticipated unlevered IRR of the communities or joint venture interests sold. We require a ""spread"" or accretion of an unlevered IRR of at least 200 basis points or higher on the communities acquired. This excess return is driven in part by what we call the AIR Edge, the cumulative result of our focus on resident selection, satisfaction, and retention, as well as relentless innovation in delivering best-in-class property management.AIRAimcoQ4 2022 or YTD 2022Q4 2019 or 2019AChangeResidentsAverage Household Income$227,000$165,00038%Median Household Income$158,000$116,00036%CSAT Score (out of 5)4.264.30(0.04)PortfolioProperties74124(40%)Apartment Homes22,20032,598(32%)Average Revenue per Apartment Home$2,747$2,27221%Redevelopment and Development ($M)$–$230($230)Mezzanine Investments ($M)$–$280($280)Low G&amp;ANet G&amp;A as % of GAV&lt;15 bps (at AIR Target)36 bps (per GSA)-21 bpsBalance SheetNet Leverage / EBITDAre6.05x7.6x(1.55x)Subsequent 24 Month Refunding (% Total Debt)*—%15%(15%)Subsequent 24 Month Repricing (% Total Debt)*—%15%(15%)Unencumbered Properties ($B)$7.6$2.4$5.2*Pro forma for the refinancing of a floating rate loan using proceeds from our fixed rate facility subsequent to year-end.Since 2019, we have improved AIR's portfolio through reducing our exposure to regulatory risk. We have achieved this through property sales in the New York, Chicago, and California markets, as well as through a strategic joint venture in California. This has allowed AIR to reallocate capital into higher growth submarkets, such as Miami-Dade and Broward counties, now 22% of AIR GAV, both markets with limited REIT competition.We estimate real estate values declined in 2022 by approximately 10% to 12% on average, the result of approximately 90 to 150 basis points of NOI cap rate expansion with about half the impact offset by strong NOI growth in the year. As a paired trade investor, AIR is agnostic as to market changes insofar as we buy and sell properties in the same market conditions, with focus on gaining an accretive ""spread."" As market conditions change, AIR adjusts target returns and spreads to reflect our new cost of capital. Our paired trade approach is intended to ensure that new acquisitions are accretive to earnings in the near-term, and will generate attractive spreads to unlevered IRRs in the long-term.TransactionsAcquisitionsAs previously announced and subsequent to the end of the quarter, AIR acquired Southgate Towers, a 495-unit luxury apartment community located in the South Beach neighborhood of Miami Beach for $298 million. AIR's presence in South Beach, a submarket with limited supply, now comprises 1,630 apartment homes between Flamingo Towers and Southgate Towers. This transaction is consistent with AIR's paired trade strategy where we look to achieve, on new acquisitions, unlevered IRRs of 200 basis points or higher relative to our cost of capital, driven by the implementation of the AIR Edge. AIR funded the transaction with proceeds from the New England portfolio sale discussed below, the assumption of $101.2 million of 4.15% in place financing maturing in 2036, and the issuance of $22.4 million of Operating Partnership Units (""OP Units""). To neutralize the issuance of OP Units, in November and December AIR repurchased an equal number of shares of common stock.DispositionsDuring the fourth quarter, we sold six properties totaling 1,314 units in the New England region for a gross sales price of $495 million, representing a trailing twelve-month NOI cap rate of 4.5%. Since the end of 2020, AIR has completed $2.2 billion of property sales and joint venture transactions at prices averaging 17% above internal estimates of GAV as measured in Q1 2020.Capital Allocation – Share RepurchasesDuring the fourth quarter, AIR repurchased 3.9 million shares for $145 million, at an average price of $37.06 per share.For the year, we repurchased an aggregate of 8.0 million shares at an average price of $39.49 for $317 million. We are authorized by AIR's Board of Directors to repurchase up to an additional $183 million of shares. We consider share buybacks as part of a balanced investment program.Balance SheetWe seek to increase financial returns by using leverage with appropriate caution. We limit risk through our balance sheet structure, employing low leverage and primarily long-dated debt. We target a Net Leverage to EBITDAre ratio between 5.0x and 6.0x, but anticipate the actual ratio will vary based on the timing of transactions. We maintain financial flexibility through ample unused and available credit, holding properties with substantial value unencumbered by property debt, maintaining an investment grade rating, and using partners’ capital when it enhances financial returns or reduces investment risk. We seek to minimize refunding and repricing risk.Components of LeverageOur leverage includes AIR's share of long-term, non-recourse property debt encumbering our apartment communities, together with outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, our term loans, unsecured notes payable, and preferred equity.DECEMBER 31, 2022($ in millions)*AmountWeighted-Avg.Maturity (Yrs.)Weighted-Avg.Term Before Repricing(Yrs.)Fixed rate loans payable$1,4678.88.8Floating rate loans payable**1383.13.1AIR share of long-term, non-recourse property debt1,6048.38.3Term loans8003.04.5Unsecured notes payable4007.57.5Outstanding borrowings on revolving credit facility4623.33.3Preferred equity***799.89.8Total Leverage$3,3466.36.8Cash and restricted cash(287)Net Leverage$3,058Net Leverage to Adjusted EBITDAre****6.05x* Amounts are presented on a rounded basis and the sum of the individual amounts may not foot; please refer to Supplemental Schedule 5.** Includes one loan with an interest rate cap at 5.35% and a second floating rate loan that was refinanced in January 2023.*** AIR’s Preferred equity is perpetual in nature; however, for illustrative purposes, we have computed the weighted-average maturity of our preferred OP Units assuming a 10-year maturity, and of our preferred stock assuming it is called at the expiration of its no-call period.**** Due to the timing of accretive share repurchases in the fourth quarter, net leverage to adjusted EBITDAre is temporarily elevated.Subsequent to year-end, and on a leverage neutral basis, AIR borrowed $320 million using 10-year fixed rate financing, bearing interest at 4.9%. Proceeds were used to refinance a floating rate loan and reduce borrowings by $230 million on our revolving credit facility. This transaction reduced floating rate debt not subject to interest rate caps or swaps to 4%, or $150 million, and increased our weighted-average maturity by nine months. Pro forma for this transaction, AIR has no debt maturing before the second quarter of 2025.LiquidityWe use our revolving credit facility for working capital and other short-term purposes, and to secure letters of credit. At December 31, 2022, our share of cash and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to tenant security deposits, was $287 million and we had the capacity to borrow up to $527 million on our revolving credit facility, bringing total liquidity to $814 million.We manage our financial flexibility by maintaining an investment grade rating from S&amp;P and Moody's, from which AIR was awarded a first-time investment grade Baa2 issuer rating in the fourth quarter, and holding communities that are unencumbered by property debt. As of December 31, 2022, we held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately $7.6 billion, almost triple the amount as of December 31, 2020. AIR's two investment grade ratings provide the company access to all debt capital market sources.Dividend and Equity Capital MarketsOn January 31, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of Common Stock. This amount is payable on February 28, 2023, to shareholders of record on February 17, 2023. On an annualized basis, the dividend represents $1.80 per share, reflecting a dividend yield of approximately 4.6% based on AIR's closing share price on February 8, 2023. In setting AIR's 2022 dividend, our Board of Directors targeted a dividend level of approximately 75% of full year FFO per share.As planned, AIR's refreshed tax basis is resulting in a tax-efficient dividend being paid to stockholders. In 2022, approximately 86% of our dividend was taxable at capital gain rates, with the remainder taxable at ordinary income rates. We believe the tax characteristics of our dividend makes our stock more attractive to taxable investors, such as foreign investors, taxable individuals, and corporations by comparison to peer shares whose dividends are taxed at higher rates. For example, AIR’s dividend characteristics in 2022 compare to a peer average of approximately 19% at capital gains rates and 71% at ordinary income rates, with 10% treated as return of capital. As a result, an investor would retain approximately 39% more of its dividend on an after tax basis through AIR’s common shares as compared to the peer average.Corporate Governance and Responsibility UpdateDuring the year, AIR met directly with holders of more than 70% of its outstanding common shares. Through a series of lunches, dinners, video meetings, conferences, property tours, in-person meetings, and calls, select Board members and Management discussed a variety of topics, such as governance, investment strategy, operations, and corporate responsibility, including CEO succession planning and Environmental, Social, and Governance (""ESG"").Our commitment to strong corporate governance was further demonstrated in the fourth quarter, where AIR’s Board determined to amend AIR's charter to reduce to a simple majority vote the threshold to amend our bylaws, which will be voted on at our next annual meeting. Our commitment extends not just to maintaining open lines of communication with shareholders, but also to improving as best practices in governance evolve. This direct shareholder engagement yielded positive results with the outcome of our annual meeting as shareholders overwhelmingly supported our directors, as well as ""say on pay"" where AIR had the highest support among peers.Strong progress was made by AIR in 2022 in advancing its commitments to responsibility beyond governance, which is detailed in AIR’s newly launched corporate responsibility website and our annual corporate responsibility report. Some highlights of 2022 include:Publishing of goals and targets consistent with the UN Sustainability Goals, with an additional commitment to transparent, data-driven disclosures consistent with the Sustainability Accounting and Standards Board (""SASB""), which guides the disclosure of financially material sustainability information by companies to their investors. The standards identify the subset of environmental, social, and governance issues most relevant to financial performance in each industry.A GRESB score of 78, which includes a perfect social responsibility score, a near perfect score in corporate governance, and an ""A"" for both public disclosure and alignment with the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (""TCFD""), which informs investors as to which companies are most at risk from climate change, best prepared, and taking action.Being named a Kingsley Elite Five, second overall and first among publicly traded peers.

Through our high-quality portfolio and best-in-class property operations, what we call the AIR Edge, we expect to be able to generate stable and durable growth across economic cycles. As markets remain turbulent, AIR is either well positioned, well prepared, or both, around several macroeconomic factors impacting operating performance and cost of capital.Inflation – In 2022, we experienced the most significant CPI inflation in 40 years. Apartments have shown their ability to reprice their rental rates to offset inflation. Combined with the increase of demand following economic recovery from the pandemic, rent growth was substantial as evidenced in 2022 with peers averaging Same Store Revenue growth of approximately 11%. Notwithstanding a high rate of inflation, AIR's emphasis on efficiency resulted in negative 10 basis points of growth in controllable operating expense (i.e., property operating expense net of real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities) over 2022, consistent with our now 13 year track record at 10 basis points of annual negative growth. AIR also expects to maintain net G&amp;A expense at less than 15 basis points of GAV in 2023.The result of an increasing top-line and stable expenses make for levered improvement to growth in Same Store NOI, measured at 14.0% in 2022. Inflation that is ""higher for longer"" will support relative outperformance by apartment owners in general, and by AIR in particular.Recession – Recessions can be mild and severe. The two most recent recessions were severe for the US economy, but much less so for the apartment business in general, and for AIR in particular.In general, the rate of bad debt, early termination of leases, and rates of turnover are a function of the quality of the property’s customer base at the arrival of the recession. During the fourth quarter, the average and median household income of AIR's new residents were $227,000 and $158,000, respectively, and our rent-to-income ratio was 20.1% for a household, higher than in the third quarter reflecting our mix of new business. More importantly, our residents have FICO scores that average 90 points higher than the national renter average. We do not expect a significant increase in bad debt in the event of a recession.Recessions are often localized to particular markets or industries. The recession in 2001 following the collapse of the ""dot-com"" economy was severe in the Bay Area technology markets, but less so, by example, in Philadelphia or Washington, D.C. The AIR portfolio is intentionally diversified across markets and submarkets with different and usually offsetting dynamics. Further, the AIR portfolio is diversified by price point with an expectation in a recession that ""B"" apartments gain even as ""A"" apartments potentially decline. AIR currently owns both ""A"" and ""B"" properties (55% and 45% of GAV, respectively), and offers apartment units at monthly price points ranging from less than $1,200 to over $20,000. Both property classes have similar average rent-to-income coverage (19% in the ""A"" portfolio and 22% in the ""B"" portfolio); however, ""B"" properties are likely to benefit from increased demand from customers that are more price sensitive in a recession, while ""A"" communities benefit from increased demand from customers ""trading up"" during a time of economic recovery.Our experience in the recessions of the Great Financial Crisis (""GFC"") and the recent pandemic may be instructive. For the full-year 2009, AIR's Same Store Revenue and Same Store NOI declined by 2.5% and 4.2%, respectively. 2010 was flat before returning to Same Store Revenue and Same Store NOI growth of 2.8% and 5.3%, respectively, in 2011. During the pandemic, AIR's Same Store Revenue and Same Store NOI declined by 2.4% and 4.0%, respectively, in 2020, while 2021 produced 1.7% and 1.6% of Same Store Revenue and Same Store NOI growth, respectively.During the GFC, there was not the same extent of government interference with creditor remedies as was the case during the pandemic, which is still continuing. In the GFC, bad debt increased by 50 basis points before reverting to the then long-term trend in our portfolio of 60 basis points within 17 months. During the pandemic, there was extensive government interference with creditor remedies in many markets, which greatly magnified customer bad debt.In general, the year-over-year growth rate in Same Store Revenue in a future year can be considered as the sum of (i) the ""earn-in"" of rents on leases made in the prior year, (ii) the magnitude of loss-to-lease (gain-to-lease), the difference between leases in place at year-end and the higher (lower) rents being paid in the future year, (iii) market rent growth in the future year, and (iv) changes in average daily occupancy or bad debt.Interest Rates – AIR is only slightly exposed to Federal Reserve policies increasing interest rates. We have low leverage, about 30% of our capitalization. We also have no loans maturing until the second quarter of 2025 and only 4% in floating rate debt. The balance sheet is in excellent shape, and we continue to look at alternatives to further extend refunding and repricing risk.Appendix B – AIR Strategic ObjectivesWe created AIR to be the most efficient and effective way to invest in U.S. multi-family real estate, due to our simplified business model, diversified portfolio of stabilized apartment communities, and low leverage. The Board of Directors has set the following strategic objectives:Pursue a simple, efficient, and predictable business model with a low-risk premiumMaintain a high-quality and diversified portfolio of stabilized multi-family propertiesImprove our best-in-class property operations platform to generate above-market organic growthMaintain an efficient cost structure with net G&amp;A less than or equal to 15 basis points of Gross Asset ValueMaintain a flexible, low levered balance sheet with access to public debt marketsEnhance portfolio quality through a disciplined approach to capital allocation, targeting accretive opportunities on a leverage neutral basisDevelop private capital partnerships as a source of equity capital for accretive growthContinue our commitment to corporate responsibility with transparent and measurable goalsEarnings Conference Call InformationLive Conference Call:Conference Call Replay:Friday, February 10, 2023 at 1:00 p.m. ETReplay available until March 11, 2023Domestic Dial-In Number: 1-844-200-6205Domestic Dial-In Number: 1-866-813-9403International Dial-In Number: 1-929-526-1599International Dial-In Number: +44-204-525-0658Passcode: 529242Passcode: 438470Live webcast and replay:investors.aircommunities.comSupplemental InformationThe full text of this Earnings Release and the Supplemental Information referenced in this release is available on AIR’s website at investors.aircommunities.com.Glossary &amp; Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial and Operating MeasuresFinancial and operating measures found in this Earnings Release and the Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by AIR management that are measures not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"").

Net income, however, was $330 million, or earnings per share of $1.36, up from $318 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.15 in the prior year period.On the company’s quarterly earnings call, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat noted that these results were led by double-digit sales increases in Europe, Japan and other Asian countries, which together outpaced its expectations. She also added that In North America, the company saw a slight decline in revenue amid a “difficult consumer backdrop” due to inflation and reduced spending.But as the executive said on the call, its growing consumer base, which increased nearly 2.6 million in North America alone in the quarter (half of these were Gen Z or Millennials), are gravitating towards the company’s emotional product – something Tapestry has focused on since it started elevating its brands.As for Greater China, sales declined 20% on a constant currency basis, below the company’s expectations as it experienced greater-than-anticipated COVID-related disruption. But, following the change in the COVID containment policy in China, Crevoiserat said that Tapestry has since experienced “a meaningful improvement” in traffic trends, driving a positive Lunar New Year performance and a solid start to the third quarter.Story continuesBy brand, Coach saw net sales of $1.4 billion in the second quarter, down 5% from the same time last year. For footwear, Crevoiserat said that Coach saw outsized growth led by trend-right styles, including the Leah Loafer and the men’s Low Line Sneaker as well as boots and booties across genders. In men’s, revenue growth was fueled by Coach’s core leather goods families, notably the Gotham, League, Charter and Hitch.At Kate Spade, net sales decreased 2% to $490.3 million in Q2, as Crevoiserat noted that the brand delivered second quarter revenue ahead of its expectations, driven by outperformance during peak selling periods, including a record Thanksgiving week and Cyber Monday event in North America. For footwear, the brand’s evergreen styles, notably boots and booties, led its performance.The good news stops, however, at Stuart Weitzman. Tapestry’s footwear brand reported net sales of $85.4 million in Q2, down 26% from the same time last year. Crevoiserat noted that the brand was impacted by its significant exposure to China as well as a decrease in wholesale. These declines were also due to a reduction in off-price shipments as Tapestry remains focused on tight inventory management and brand elevation. However, in its North America direct business, sales rose mid-single digits.As for its footwear successes, the executive noted that the “Soho” remained a top collection with notable success among younger customers given the family’s on-trend lug soul. The “Stuart,” a new staple in the brand’s offering resonated across age groups, while the “Land” styles “acted as a strong recruitment tool,” Crevoiserat said.Overall, though, the CEO said that Tapestry generated second quarter earnings well above expectations, supported by stronger-than-anticipated margins. On a currency-neutral basis, EPS rose 10%, which it accomplished despite headwinds in China and continued investment in its platform capabilities and its brands.As such, the company raised its fiscal 2023 earnings outlook with expected revenue of approximately $6.6 billion. Crevoiserat noted the move incorporates a more moderate headwind from currency, the expectation of more modest growth in Greater China for the fiscal year and the operational outperformance of the second quarter.“Our foundation is strong, and our runway is significant,” Crevoiserat told analysts. “We are staying agile and disciplined in a volatile environment to successfully navigate current headwinds and at the same time, drive forward our long-term growth agenda.”]"

TPR reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top line marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the bottom line beat the same. This house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle brands witnessed a net sales decline but year-over-year growth in earnings per share. The parent of Coach and Kate Spade brands raised earnings view for the fiscal year on gains from operational efficiency.We note that shares of Tapestry jumped 7.5% during the trading hours on Feb 9 on solid earnings results in the second quarter and higher earnings view for fiscal 2023. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 42.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 17.6% growth.Sales &amp; Earnings PictureTapestry posted second-quarter earnings of $1.36 a share, which beat the consensus mark of $1.26. Also, the metric grew 10% from the year-ago period despite adverse currency translations to the tune of 11 cents a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNet sales of this New York-based company came in at $2,025.4 million, marginally missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,034 million. The metric also dipped 5% on a year-over-year basis on lower sales across each brand. On a constant-currency basis, the top line fell 2%, excluding an FX headwind of about 380 basis points.Let’s Delve DeeperFor the second quarter, net sales for Coach came in at 1,449.7 million, down 5% year over year. Kate Spade’s sales came in at $490.3 million, down 2% from the year-ago period. Net sales for Stuart Weitzman totaled $85.4 million, reflecting a decline of 26% year over year.Sales in North America dipped 2% year over year, representing growth of about 25% versus FY19 pre-pandemic levels on a reported basis. The company added nearly 2.6 million new customers in North America.  Tapestry saw double-digit sales increases at constant currency in Other Asia, Japan and Europe, which outpaced expectations. It delivered low-single-digit constant currency revenue growth outside of Greater China. This consisted of a low-single-digit increase in direct-to-consumer sales on gains from stores. In Greater China, revenue fell 20% in constant currency owing to incremental pressures related to the pandemic. However, the company has seen a major sequential improvement in traffic and revenue trends in the third quarter to date.Story continuesTapestry, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Tapestry, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTapestry, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tapestry, Inc. Quote Margin DiscussionThe consolidated gross profit came in at $1,389.3 million, down 4.7% from the year-ago period. However, the gross margin increased 50 basis points to 68.6%, gaining from operational efficiency and lower freight expenses of 130 basis points. This was somewhat offset by an FX headwind of about 100 basis points.Further, the company reported an operating income of $418.2 million, down from an operating income of $462.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the operating margin came in at 20.6% and was hurt by an FX headwind of approximately 120 basis points.Store UpdateAt the end of the quarter, Tapestry operated 341 Coach stores, 208 Kate Spade outlets and 37 Stuart Weitzman stores in North America. Internationally, the count was 612, 192 and 62 for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, respectively.Other Financial DetailsTapestry ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $846.2 million, long-term debt of $1,647.5 million and stockholders' equity of $2,313.2 million.Free cash flow for the year-to-date period through the second quarter was an inflow of $354 million. The company incurred capital expenditures and implementation costs related to Cloud Computing of $149 million in the aforementioned period.Tapestry returned $444 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends during the first half of fiscal 2023. The company looks to repurchase approximately $700 million worth of shares in fiscal 2023, with $300 million spent in the first six months to repurchase approximately 8.4 million shares at an average cost of $35.73. The company anticipates a dividend payout of about $300 million. Management expects to return about $1 billion to shareholders during fiscal 2023, buoyed by its healthy balance sheet and free cash flow generation.OutlookManagement raised its earnings view for fiscal 2023 on its operational outperformance in the second quarter and a more moderate currency headwind than previously anticipated. These are likely to be somewhat offset by a more modest revenue improvement assumption for Greater China. We note that Greater China has shown a significant sequential improvement third quarter to date.Tapestry now envisions revenues to be roughly $6.6 billion, reflecting a slight decrease versus the prior year owing to nearly 300 basis points of FX pressure. On a constant currency basis, revenue is estimated to grow 2%-3% year over year. Earlier, the company projected revenues of $6.5-$6.6 billion for fiscal 2023.The company now guided earnings in the band of $3.70-$3.75, representing high-single-digit growth compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis and includes a currency headwind of approximately 40 cents.

This compares to earnings of $1.33 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of high-end shoes and handbags would post earnings of $0.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.79, delivering a surprise of 6.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Tapestry , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $2.03 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.41%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.14 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Tapestry shares have added about 13.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Tapestry?While Tapestry has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Tapestry: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA).Nvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 63% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nvidia here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NVDA Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.9% over the past month to $3.26.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BAX reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 88 cents, significantly missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. The bottom line declined 15% from the year-ago quarter as costs and expenses rose due to inflationary pressures, the negative impact of foreign exchange and higher interest expense.GAAP EPS in the quarter was 36 cents, down 23% from the prior-year quarter. The decline was due to the recognition of one-time special items totaling $263 million after tax.Revenue DetailsRevenues of $3.89 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.77 billion. The top line improved 11% year over year on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency (cc) basis. Sales grew 2% on an operational basis — excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and the December 2021 acquisition of Hillrom.Geographical DetailsBaxter reported operating results through three geographic segments — Americas (North and South America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia Pacific).In the Americas, Baxter revenues totaled $1.74 billion, down 1% on a year-over-year basis and flat at cc.In EMEA, revenues totaled $750 million, down 8% from the year-ago quarter while up 5% at cc.In APAC, revenues of $668 million declined 9% from the prior-year quarter while up 2% at cc.Baxter International Inc.

During the quarter under review, the company recorded $734 million in sales from Hilrom’s businesses. Patient Support Systems reported revenues of $360 million, while Front Line Care and Surgical Solutions delivered revenues of $293 million and $81 million, respectively. Sales of the segments have increased sequentially for the last two reported quarters.Story continuesRenal CareThis segment reported revenues of $981 million in the quarter under review, down 5% from the prior-year quarter but up 3% at cc.Medication DeliveryRevenues at the segment amounted to $745 million, down 5% from the year-ago quarter and down 2% at cc.PharmaceuticalsRevenues at the segment totaled $525 million, down 9% from the year-ago quarter and down 1% at cc.Clinical NutritionRevenues at the segment were $231 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter but up 6% at cc.Advanced SurgeryRevenues at the segment amounted to $247 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter and up 8% at cc.Acute TherapiesThis segment reported revenues of $158 million, down 10% from the prior-year quarter and down 3% at cc.BioPharma SolutionsThis segment reported revenues of $172 million, up 6% from the prior-year quarter and up 12% at cc.OtherRevenues in the segment were $38 million, up 23% on a year-over-year basis and at cc.Margin AnalysisBaxter reported an adjusted gross profit of $1.62 billion for the fourth quarter, up 3.9% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, the gross margin declined 270 basis points (bps) to 41.6% in the fourth quarter.Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $912 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Research and development expenses were $155 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted operating income were down 6.6% year over year at $663 million in the quarter under review. As a percentage of revenues, the operating margin contracted 310 bps to 17.1% in the quarter under review.2023 Guidance IssuedFor first-quarter 2023, Baxter anticipates sales to decline by 3% on a reported basis and 1% at cc.For the same period, adjusted EPS is expected between 46 cents and 50 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 77 cents per share.For full-year 2023, Baxter anticipates sales to improve 1-2%. Sales are expected to remain flat or grow by 1% at cc.Adjusted earnings per share are estimated in the range of $2.75-$2.95 in 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $3.56.Summing UpBaxter ended fourth-quarter 2022 on a dismal note, wherein revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings missed the same. The company witnessed lower sales across five of its business units. Contraction in growth rates across all geographies and gross and operating margins is concerning. Unfavorable currency movement hurt the sales growth rate. Moreover, earnings outlook for 2023 is significantly lower than market expectations, reflecting inflationary pressures, rising interest expense and higher tax rate.Meanwhile, cut-throat competition in the MedTech market remains a woe. An increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is concerning. Weakness in Renal Care, Pharmaceuticals, BioPharma Solutions and Acute Therapies is disappointing.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Baxter carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

During the quarter, the company faced significant foreign-exchange headwinds, apart from supply chain and inflation-related challenges. The lowered reported revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2023 indicates the continuation of this gloomy trend.Barring AST and Healthcare, the poor reported revenue performance across two of STERIS’ operating segments is a major concern.

The company-adjusted gross margin was 52.5%, reflecting a decline of 240 bps compared with the year-ago period when Haemonetics reported one of its highest-ever adjusted gross margins of 54.9%.Adjusted operating margin was 16.8%, down 158 bps from the year-ago quarter. Haemonetics noted that higher adjusted operating expenses in both periods were due to higher performance-based compensation, continuous investments in sales and marketing, higher freight costs and normalized spending levels, partially offset by additional savings from the operational excellence program. In the fiscal third quarter, the company also had higher research and development costs, primarily due to increased investments in product innovation.Story continuesFinancial PositionHaemonetics exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $224 million compared with $241.2 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Long-term debt at the end of the fiscal third quarter was $756.8 million, down from $759.6 million at the end of fiscal second quarter.Cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $193.4 million compared with a $104.2 million net cash used in operating activities a year ago.As part of its previously announced $300 million share repurchase program, the company repurchased 997,406 shares of its common shares for $75.0 million via an accelerated share repurchase program in the fiscal second quarter. However, it has not repurchased any additional stock in fiscal Q3.2023 GuidanceThe company updated its outlook for 2023.For 2023, the company now expects GAAP total revenue growth in the range of 15-17% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 12-15%). Organic revenue growth is currently expected in the range of 18-20% (up from the prior projection of 15-18%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.12 billion.The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share in the band of $2.90-$3.00 (compared with the previous estimate of $2.70-$3.00). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.87.Our TakeHaemonetics exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023, with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The robust performance of the Plasma and Hospital business, with continued strength in the Hemostasis Management product line, instills optimism. Robust contributions from the Vascular Closure business also seem promising. The full-year outlook for revenues and EPS with strong year-over-year growth indicates the continuity of this growth momentum.However, the year-over-year decline in the company’s Blood Center business raises apprehension. The contraction of both margins in the face of macroeconomic challenges is an added woe.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksHaemonetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

312,7fb8b49a-949d-358e-936f-4795f98d4e7f,APD,2023-02-10,The 7 Best Hydrogen Stocks to Buy for February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-hydrogen-stocks-buy-020716521.html,1675735636,STORY,"['APD', 'ITMPF', 'BE', 'PLUG', 'AFGYF', 'LIN']","[In many ways, the case for the best hydrogen stocks to buy practically sells itself. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), “…clean hydrogen is currently enjoying unprecedented political and business momentum, with the number of policies and projects around the world expanding rapidly.” That was back in June 2019. Today, the circumstances favor the alternative energy source even more.Due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, shocked global leaders pivoted quickly toward alternative energy infrastructures. Essentially, the free world learned a harsh lesson: nations can’t rely on belligerent actors for their critical resources. Moving forward, then, research and development toward alternative power solutions will rise, benefitting the best hydrogen stocks to buy.SHELShell$57.85LINLinde$322.86APDAir Products &amp; Chemicals$283.03PLUGPlug Power$16.48BEBloom Energy$24.13ITMPFITM Power$1.35AFGYFAFC Energy$0.35InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsShell (SHEL)logo on a gas station in Iceland.Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comRepresenting one of the world’s biggest hydrocarbon industry players, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) might seem an odd entry for one of the best hydrogen stocks to buy. However, management appears to realize the inevitable trend toward hydrogen. Last year, Shell made headlines when it announced plans to build Europe’s largest renewable energy hydrogen plant.For investors trickling into the alternative energy space, SHEL makes for a solid case for the best hydrogen stocks to buy. Aside from the coronavirus-impacted years, Shell has revenue predictability. Further, the company enjoys a decent balance sheet. On the bottom line, Shell’s net margin stands at nearly 12%, beating out almost 64% of the competition.Better yet, Wall Street analysts support the upside narrative of SHEL stock. Currently, they peg shares as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $67.81, implying an upside potential of over 16%.Story continuesLinde (LIN)Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical companySource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.comA multinational chemical company founded in Germany, Linde (NYSE:LIN) is one of the world’s largest industrial gas companies by market share and revenue, per its corporate profile. In addition, Linde is the only company to cover every step in the hydrogen value chain from production and processing through distribution and storage to everyday industrial and consumer applications.Financially, Linde provides investors seeking the best hydrogen stocks to buy plenty of positive attributes. On the balance sheet, it features an Altman Z-Score of 3.78, reflecting low bankruptcy risk over the next two years. Operationally, the company posts three-year revenue growth of 9.9%, beating out 63.5% of the competition. On the bottom line, its net margin of 11.4% outpaces over 70% of its peers.As of this writing, Wall Street analysts peg LIN stock as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $366.44, implying an upside potential of over 13%. Even better, sentiment among hedge funds rates as very positive.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comBased in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) focuses on its principal business, which involves selling gases and chemicals for industrial uses. Notably, under the context of the best hydrogen stocks to buy, APD represents the world’s leading hydrogen supplier. Per its website, it owns and operates over 100 hydrogen plants producing more than seven million kilograms (three billion standard cubic feet) per day of hydrogen.As with Shell above, Air Products enjoys quite a few positive attributes. For starters, the company’s Altman Z-Score hits 4.93, indicating very low bankruptcy risk in the next two years. Operationally, Air Products’ three-year revenue growth rate stands at 12.3%, beating out nearly 71% of its peers. Also, on the bottom line, its net margin pings at 17.8%. This stat ranks above nearly 87% of industry players.Presently, Wall Street analysts peg APD as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $327.73, implying an upside potential of nearly 15%. Adding to the encouraging tone, hedge funds also support APD, rating it very positively.Plug Power (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockStanding among the decidedly speculative portion of the best hydrogen stocks to buy, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) may still be appealing to investors that want to go “all in.” Focused on the development of hydrogen fuel systems that replace conventional batteries, Plug represents an aspirational enterprise. This year, investors appear to be loving it, with PLUG stock gaining nearly 43% of equity value.To be fair, though, prospective buyers must be willing to overlook many fiscal vulnerabilities. About the one positive that distinguishes itself is the balance sheet. With an Altman Z-Score of 3.49, Plug rates in the safe zone. However, its three-year revenue growth rate of 4.2% pings just above middling for the industry. Also, for the moment, Plug Power is a deeply unprofitable company.Nevertheless, this doesn’t seem to bother Wall Street analysts. Currently, PLUG enjoys a consensus moderate buy rating. Furthermore, their average price target hit $26.67, implying an upside potential of 53.45%. Finally, hedge fund sentiment for PLUG rates as very positive, making it one of the best hydrogen stocks to buy for gamblers.Bloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockHeadquartered in San Jose, California, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) manufactures and markets solid oxide fuel cells that produce electricity on-site. Per its public profile, Bloom’s fuel cells are subsidized by government incentive programs for green energy. Moreover, BE happens to be a monster performer in the charts. In the trailing year, shares soared over 73%.However, as with Plug Power, prospective investors must realize that Bloom carries an aspirational profile. For instance, Bloom’s balance sheet is poor. In particular, its Altman Z-Score slipped 0.34 below parity, indicating a distressed enterprise. Also, its profit margins (aside from gross margins) presently sit in negative territory. Still, one positive is that Bloom’s three-year book growth rate stands at a robust 42.2%.Despite the challenges, they don’t deter Wall Street analysts, who peg BE stock as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target pings at $30.38, indicating an upside potential of 23%. For further confirmation, sentiment among hedge funds rates as very positive.ITM Power (ITMPF)Hydrogen Stocks Man hold a fuel dispenser with hydrogen on gas station. h2 combustion engine for emission free eco friendly transport. Plug Power is one such company working on this power source.Source: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.comMoving into the over-the-counter segment of the best hydrogen stocks to buy, ITM Power (OTCMKTS:ITMPF) is an energy storage and clean fuel company founded in the U.K. in 2001. According to its corporate profile, ITM designs manufactures, and integrates electrolyzers based on proton exchange membrane technology to produce green hydrogen using renewable electricity and tap water.Undeniably, ITM represents a scientific juggernaut. However, we’ve got to look at this investment honestly – the financials could use some work. Sure, ITM enjoys a strong war chest, given its cash-to-debt ratio of 45.22 times. As well, the company’s Altman Z-Score pings at over 7, reflecting low bankruptcy risk.However, Gurufocus.com clearly warns that ITM represents a possible value trap. Given its negative revenue and earnings trend, it’s hard to ignore the warning signs. Plus, in the trailing year, ITMPF tumbled over 61%. That said, over the past few months, shares have stabilized. If you have some loose change lying around, ITM could be interesting.AFC Energy (AFGYF)a symbol with H2 (hydrogen) on it and a fill-up tankSource: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.comFor those that want to swing for the fences with their best hydrogen stocks to buy, then AFC Energy (OTCMKTS:AFGYF) could fit the bill. Also based in the U.K., AFC is a developer of alkaline fuel cells which use hydrogen for electricity production. Although shares incurred a rough time in 2022, in the new year, they’re up nearly 15%.Will that be enough to convince you to acquire AFGYF? Frankly, those seeking the best hydrogen stocks to buy for the long haul should consider the top five names first. Still, AFC could intrigue gamblers. Despite horrible operational figures, the company enjoys decent stability in the balance sheet. For instance, its cash-to-debt ratio stands at 64.26 times, outpacing over 86% of the industry.Still, it’s a terribly risky bet. For instance, the market prices AFC at an astronomical 230-times trailing sales. As you might imagine, the enterprise rates as deeply unprofitable. It’s an aspirational trade, through and through. Nevertheless, priced at 29 cents a pop, AFC will likely attract speculative interest.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would like to emphasize that functionality for the question-and-answer queue will be given at that time. . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.Gabrielle Brown: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings.Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and on our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.Lachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Gabby, and thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter results. Our fiscal second quarter continued to build upon the strength of the first quarter to deliver record first half ratings and revenue at Fox. Financially, we delivered a 4% increase in our top line, including a 4% advertising revenue growth. Our EBITDA grew a massive 71%, principally due to strong advertising results from sports and political as well as the impact of exiting Thursday Night Football. Our television segment led this growth and had a truly stellar performance. The station's group posted another record political midterm cycle, with approximately $250 million booked during the first half of our fiscal year.Story continuesThis is higher than our previous midterm record and just shy of our fiscal '21 presidential year record. These are impressive numbers and reinforce the strength and breadth of our station group. FOX Sports was also a key growth driver this past quarter where advertising, pricing and demand remains solid on the back of viewership records for the NFL and for the World Cup. By every measure, FOX Sports is having an extraordinary year. Fox's domination of the fall was led by four of our most prominent rights packages, the NFL, the Big Ten network, Major League Baseball and FIFA, all coming together to produce a truly powerful schedule. For the fourth straight calendar year, FOX Sports is the industry leader in live events, with some notable achievements that bode well for our future, including the current NFL regular season on FOX averaged over 19 million viewers and finished as the number one NFL package on television.America's Game of the Week averaged just over 24 million viewers and is projected to be the most watched program of all of television for the 14th straight year. And our Thanksgiving game this year was the most watched regular season game ever on any network, delivering 42 million viewers. College Football had its most watched season ever on Fox, led by Big Noon Saturday, which was the most watched college football window for the second straight year, while the annual Ohio State-Michigan rivalry was the most watched regular season college game on any network in 11 years. And, of course, the 2022 Men's World Cup exceeded our expectations with average viewership of over the tournament up 30% from the 2018 matches. We can't wait for the Women's World Cup this summer, and we're already getting ready for the 2026 Men's World Cup here in North America.Of course, the strength of the FOX Sports portfolio was on full display this past Thanksgiving, with our traditional Thanksgiving NFL game, USA versus England in the World Cup, a huge college football game and America's Game of the Week, all spread over just four days. The ratings were impressive, but the revenue we generated was even better. We wrote just shy of $250 million over the long weekend. And the strength of FOX Sports has continued into the current quarter on the back of exciting player football and what will be a record sold out Super Bowl this coming Sunday. At Tubi, we had another strong quarter where ad revenues grew by 25% over last year, as we continue to outperform our peers. We have seen increases in almost every major KPI of Tubi, including CPMs, TVT and engagement.In fact, Tubi had its highest quarterly viewership in this fiscal second quarter, with total viewing time up 41% year-on-year, while December alone was the highest TVT and highest user month ever. These trends have continued early into the third quarter as Tubi add viewers and content to the platform. At FOX Entertainment, Rob Wade has settled into his new role as CEO and has already launched two of the season's biggest hits; Accused, ranked as the most watched debut on any broadcast or cable network in two years, and Special Forces: World's Toughest Test is this season's number one unscripted program. Further, FOX Entertainment recently announced a multiyear extension with Hulu of our longstanding content licensing agreement, which bolsters Fox's streaming audience and provides Hulu with a key point of differentiation in a crowded streaming world.Turning to FOX News media, the FOX News channel ended the second quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and in primetime, while maintaining its lead as the most watched cable news network, beating CNN and MSNBC combined in both total viewers and demo in the quarter for both prime and total day. And the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, beating CNBC in total viewers during the business day and market hours for the third consecutive quarter. FOX Nation accelerated subscriber growth over the last quarter and last year and had the best quarter ever for engagement in terms of hours viewed, no doubt driven by brilliant fresh content like Yellowstone: One Fifty. Looking at the distribution side of our business, we have now completed most of the deals expiring in the first year of our multiyear affiliate renewal cycle.So far the results confirm the confidence we have in monetizing our leading brands and content, and we are pleased that the market recognizes the value that Fox delivers to their offerings. It has been a truly strong quarter, one that showcased the very best of Fox and has shown that the underlying performance of Fox is exceptionally healthy. Looking ahead into this third fiscal quarter, our top line will, of course, be aided by a record Super Bowl. But we are still seeing solid national demand for our news and sports platforms, growth in the Tubi KPIs and we are encouraged to see multiple ad categories pacing strongly positive at our local stations. Before handing the call over to Steve, I want to add some perspective to the Fox story. In the almost four years since the spin, Fox has grown and flourished while pursuing a simple strategy, a core business of trusted brands that delivers consistent and substantial audiences and a portfolio of digital growth initiatives that scale over time.With our focused sports and news franchises, we have taken a differentiated approach, choosing to serve our audience primarily through the pay TV ecosystem, which optimizes the delivery and value of live programming. Our ability to drive our business and execute our strategy is underpinned by a number of accomplishments. For example, our affiliate and advertising revenue growth is driven by our pricing power, reinforced by regularly delivering large scale audiences and uniquely providing exclusive content to our pay TV distributors. This approach has led to nearly $2 billion in affiliate revenue growth and over 1.3 billion in advertising revenue growth since the spin in 2019. By focusing on live content, our core Fox brands have been able to run sharply counter to the broader trend of linear TV.We can see this by looking at consumption trends. Over the past 10 years, consumption of FOX Sports events is up 18% and consumption of FOX News is up 28%. Our portfolio of sports rights is secure and is the best out there, with the vast majority of them locked up for the foreseeable future. Our NFL rights, the single best package in all of television extends to the 2033 season. We just completed the first year of our Major League Baseball extension and renewed our Big Ten rights, which each takes us out through the end of the decade. We have the European Championships through 2028 and another cycle with our FIFA World Cup rights. These long-term rights provide us the visibility and necessary flexibility to plan our businesses and pursue growth opportunities moving forward.On the digital side, we have made calculated investments in areas where we believe we can add significant value. Sports wagering and advertising video-on-demand are the two best examples of this. We have a firm footing in the sports gambling space. We were the first among U.S. media companies to strike a partnership with a betting operator because we see the potential for sports betting to drive engagement, enhance the viewing experience, and keep viewers coming back to FOX Sports linear and digital platforms. The various financial options and investments we have reflect our view that sports gambling is a long-term play and we are focused on cementing our leadership in this rapidly evolving and high growth sector. Tubi, the number one AVOD player, leads our streaming strategy and with minimal investment when compared to our peers.Revenue and engagement KPIs at Tubi have far exceeded our expectations and are consistently growing in the healthy double digit range since we acquired it almost three years ago. The results at Tubi are proof that our strategy is working and we will continue investing in and growing this platform. Finally, I'd like to address the recent announcement regarding News Corporation. As you know, my father and I reached the conclusion that exploring a combination with News Corp. is not optimal for shareholders of Fox or News Corp. at this time. As such, the special committees were disbanded and no further time or action is being taken on this topic. I've said in the past that I think scale provides flexibility and that it's important to be prepared when opportunities present themselves.The rationale behind considering accommodation with News Corp. was about that; scale, flexibility, synergies, opportunities, great IP and above all creating value for all shareholders. As a CEO of Fox, I have never felt more confident about our strategy, the quality of our assets and the strength of our financial position. This confidence is clearly demonstrated by this morning's announcement to increase our share repurchase authorization to $7 billion, with the immediate deployment of $1 billion of the expanded authorization toward an accelerated share repurchase transaction, while continuing our current in-market purchases. Consistent with our track record, we remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner.And we will continue to explore every opportunity to maximize that value over the long term. And now, let me turn it over to Steve for more on the results.Fox, bikeappic-M0TCk5QYsS8-unsplashSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Fox continued to deliver financially in the fiscal second quarter, with total company revenue growth of 4% and 71% growth in EBITDA. Notwithstanding the absence of Thursday Night Football, our overall revenue growth was led by a 4% increase in advertising revenues where in the quarter, we saw continued strength in political advertising of the stations, which when viewed across the full fiscal first half, nearly matched the political record set during the 2020 presidential cycle. Additionally, our sports advertising was supported by a full roster of marquee events and Tubi continued to sustain its high growth trajectory. Our affiliate revenues increased by 1%, with limited renewal activity impacting the quarter and trailing 12 months subscriber losses remaining consistent at approximately 7%.Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $531 million, up $220 million over the prior year. In addition to our revenue growth, we also have benefited from lower expenses as a result of our early exit from the Thursday Night Football agreement. Net income attributable to stockholders was $330 million, or $0.58 per share, up meaningfully against a net loss of $85 million, or negative $0.15 per share, reported in the prior year period. Alongside our growth in EBITDA, you'll recall that our GAAP P&amp;L is regularly impacted by the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter, which we recognize in other net. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, growth was strong with adjusted EPS of $0.48 per share, up $0.35 against last year's $0.13 per share.Turning to our segments. At television, we delivered 6% revenue growth, including a 5% increase in advertising revenues. As you know, our advertising revenues in the December quarter of last year benefited from our coverage of Thursday Night Football. Despite that comparable headwind, we delivered meaningful gains across the segment. This was led by the strong political cycle, the addition of the World Cup at FOX Sports and continued strong growth at Tubi. On the NFL specifically, we also have benefited from strong pricing, a record-breaking Thanksgiving Day broadcast and the timing of Week 18 of the season sliding back into the December quarter. Meanwhile, advertising revenue growth at Tubi was up 25% in the quarter and exceeded $200 million on the back of record levels of engagement.In an uneven programmatic advertising marketplace, we're able to maintain CPMs and are well positioned to deploy more inventory as market conditions strengthen. Television affiliate fee revenues were up 6% as healthy growth in pricing across all Fox affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues increased 26% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the consolidation of the prior year acquisition of MarVista. EBITDA in our television segment was up $529 million to $256 million as we benefited from the strong political market and realized the anticipated financial benefit from the exit of our Thursday Night Football agreement. These benefits were partially offset by higher costs from the World Cup and the annual growth in rights amortization we see across our sports portfolio.Similar to the levels reported in our fiscal first quarter, our net EBITDA investment in Tubi amounted to approximately $50 million in the December quarter. At cable, we saw revenues generally in line with the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were essentially flat. As Lachlan mentioned, we continue to see meaningful pricing gains in national advertising across our leadership brands. Additionally, our national sports networks benefited from the broadcast of the World Cup in the quarter. However, this was offset by a softer direct response marketplace that impacted FOX News Media. Cable affiliate fee revenues were broadly flat coming in at $1.03 billion. As we have signaled previously, we are in the early days of our next distribution renewal cycle where we expect revenue gains to be skewed towards the television segment.Meanwhile, cable other revenues were up 7% in the quarter, once again led by higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. EBITDA in our cable segment was $353 million compared to the $668 million reported last year, largely due to higher costs of the national sports networks led by the World Cup and postseason baseball. Expenses were also elevated at FOX News Media due to the digital investments at nation and weather and higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation. Now turning to cash flow, we're consistent with the normal seasonality of our working capital cycle. We recorded a free cash flow deficit of $610 million in the quarter. This typical first half trend reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and the build-up of advertising related receivables, both of which reverse in the second half of our fiscal year.From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased $550 million by our share buyback program. This takes the total cumulative amount repurchased to $3.15 billion, representing 15% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the program in 2019. In addition, today, we declared a $0.25 semiannual dividend. And as Lachlan mentioned, this morning, we also announced an incremental buyback authorization of $3 billion, taking our total authorization to $7 billion. We will immediately deploy $1 billion of this expanded authorization toward an accelerated share repurchase transaction, while concurrently continuing with our normal course buyback pacing which would see us repurchase $450 million in additional shares across the remainder of the fiscal year.These meaningful capital return measures are enabled by the strength of our financial position where we again closed the quarter with a very robust balance sheet, comprising $4 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby.Gabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investing community.See also Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield and 16 Largest Photography Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 best countries in basketball.One of the most popular sports in the world, basketball is over a century old, which is relatively new compared to other popular sports such as football or tennis. However, the fast-paced nature of the sport combined with high scores and a high entertainment value has seen its audience grow across the world, but particularly in the U.S.You might be forgiven for thinking that the National Basketball Association, or the NBA as it is more popularly known, is the oldest basketball organization in the world. After all, it was established almost 80 years ago and is the premier basketball league in the world. However, the first professional basket league was the National Basketball League established in 1898, and which lasted just 6 years.16 best countries in basketballEugene Onischenko/Shutterstock.comFrom relatively obscure beginnings, which led to the first professional basketball league disbanding in a few years, basketball is now a truly global sport with a following of hundreds of millions of people, while the NBA is among the richest professional sports leagues in the world. The major fan following, especially in the U.S., has attracted incredibly lucrative broadcasting deals, which has led to it becoming a huge source of revenue for various stakeholders, from teams and players to sponsors and broadcasters. In fact, from a business perspective, basketball provides various opportunities to generate revenue, including broadcasting rights, sponsorship deals, merchandise sales and ticket sales, which also then contribute to the economy of the best countries in basketball.Some of the most valuable sports companies in the world are basketball teams, all of them in the NBA. This includes teams such as the Golden State Warriors and New York Knicks which combined are worth well over $10 billion, which is an astronomical figure for sports teams, and makes them more valuable than arguably more global football teams such as Real Madrid Football Club or Manchester United plc (NYSE:MANU), both of which have a huge global fanbase. Meanwhile, other teams such as the Los Angeles Lakers and Chicago Bulls are also each worth billions of dollars. These teams consistently sell out their home games which brings in higher revenue from ticket sales while the sport's popularity has led to a creation of a luxury market in this respect, including luxury boxes and VIP seating.Story continuesAnother important source of revenue for basketball is broadcast rights. As mentioned earlier, because of the sport's appeal, basketball is highly sought after by broadcasters, who are willing to pay large amounts of money for the rights to air games. For example, the NBA has a multi-billion dollar broadcast deal with The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) ESPN and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:WBD) TNT, which allows the league to reach a wide audience. Meanwhile, sponsorship deals are also an important part in the business of basketball. Teams and players have partnerships with a range of companies, from sports apparel brands like NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) to fast food chains like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). These deals provide teams and players with additional revenue streams while merchandise sales are another important revenue generator for basketball. Teams and players have merchandise lines which earns sports teams additional millions in revenue.Currently, Spain is the number one country in the world of basketball, topping the rankings by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). This is primarily because Spain is the current World Champion and European champion, and knocked off the U.S. from the number one spot after an uninterrupted reign of 12 years! However, we don't believe that Spain tops the list of the best countries in basketball. Yes, it may have won the World Cup when the competition was last hosted but that alone does not determine if the country is the best. When Greece won the football Euros in 2004, it was nowhere close to the level of other European footballing nations but luck, courage and determination allowed it to win all its games 1-0 in the knockout stages, after only qualifying from the group stage not on points or goal difference, but just number of goals scored. However, it is true that Spain has invested heavily in the country's basketball infrastructure which has seen it rise to this level, and this could allow the nation to reap more benefits in the next several years.That's why, to determine the best countries in basketball, we decided to first determine the gold, silver and bronze medal winners in the Olympics and the World Cup in the sport of basketball. We then added all gold, silver and bronze medals for each country, before assigning 70% weightage to gold, 20% to silver and 10% to bronze, since a gold medal is by far the most important one. There aren't many countries which have achieved significant success in basketball, so it was easier to finalize the list. For Russia, we added all achievements by Russia, Yugoslavia and Soviet Union. So now, let's take a look at the giants of basketball, with a few standouts, starting with:16. ChileTotal gold medals in World Cup / Olympics: 0Total silver medals in World Cup / Olympics: 0Total bronze medals in World Cup / Olympics: 2Two bronze medals in 1950 and 1959 allows Chile to be counted among the best countries in basketball.15.

The issues, which began surfacing yesterday afternoon, now appear to be resolved, but come as Twitter is gearing up for the Super Bowl. The sports event expected to be a huge draw for users and advertisers. It comes as new CEO and owner Elon Musk tries to eke revenue from the micro-blogging site, following massive cost cutting measures and layoffs.11 members of the board of oil giant Shell are being personally sued over allegedly failing to manage climate risks. In what's been labeled a first of its kind lawsuit, a group called ClientEarth accuses the company's directors of failing to implement a strategy that moves it away from fossil fuels and in line with the Paris Agreement. Shell's rejected the claim, saying all decisions were made in the best interests of the company.And household service cleaner brand Fabuloso recalling almost 5 million bottles over potential bacterial contamination. The Colgate-Palmolive brand saying the cleaners did not have enough of an antibacterial preservative added. It's offering reimbursements for affected customers.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Comcast What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$13.1bUS$14.4bUS$16.4bUS$16.9bUS$17.8bUS$18.5bUS$19.1bUS$19.7bUS$20.2bUS$20.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x19Analyst x17Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x4Est @ 3.91%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.70%Est @ 2.51% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$12.1kUS$12.3kUS$12.9kUS$12.2kUS$11.9kUS$11.4kUS$10.8kUS$10.3kUS$9.8kUS$9.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$113bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.1%) = US$333bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$333b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$148bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$261b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$37.9, the company appears quite good value at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Comcast as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.070. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ComcastStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Media market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

These locations now have the foundational network enhancements in place to begin deploying DOCSIS 4.0, setting the stage for the introduction of new symmetrical multi-gigabit Internet options before the end of 2023 that can be delivered across existing networks with less cost.This press release features multimedia.

The full deployment of these technical capabilities will reach more than 50 million homes and businesses by 2025. In addition to fast speeds, DOCSIS 4.0 technologies will deliver even greater reliability and capacity to power multiple data-intensive applications.""Streaming live sports, 4K gaming, hybrid work, and virtual reality have gone mainstream in just a few years, and gig speeds, capacity, reliability, and low latency are key factors making our connectivity experience superior to the competition,"" said Dave Watson, CEO, Comcast Cable. ""Our definition of reliability has to shift from merely being always-on, to powering multiple data-intensive applications across dozens of devices, and the investments we are making in our network are creating immediate benefits for our customers.""Story continuesWiFi Boost Guarantee and Storm-Ready WiFi The company also unveiled plans to rollout new WiFi features in the coming months that build upon its industry-leading service reliability with a guarantee offer that increases support for in-home WiFi, and a new device with cellular and battery backup to help keep customers connected even when the power goes out.Low Latency Features For applications like gaming, virtual reality, and videoconferencing where lower latency is increasingly important, later this year Comcast will also unveil new low latency features that will enable an even better experience than they have today.Recently, Comcast accelerated the transformation of its network to a virtualized, cloud-based architecture that is fully prepared for the emergence of more robust 10G technologies and DOCSIS 4.0. This network architecture enables Comcast to deliver symmetrical, multi-gigabit speeds to both residential and business customers, which technically limited fixed wireless providers are unable to deliver. Comcast’s ongoing network evolution also furthers its commitment to provide a cleaner, greener Internet by doubling network energy efficiency by 2030. We estimate this will avoid the equivalent amount of electricity needed to power a half a million homes for a year.The significant advances Comcast has made over the past 24 months, including several world firsts, coupled with one of the world’s first WiFi 6E gateways and powerful Xfinity Pod WiFi extenders, are delivering a revolutionary connectivity experience that is powering Comcast homes. At this critical time in the nation’s broadband deployment, Comcast’s continued advancement of new 10G technologies will position it as the clear leader for years to come.About Comcast Corporation Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company that connects people to moments that matter.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please, go ahead.Bob McLaughlin: Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of International Businesses; PGIM , our Global Investment Manager, Caroline Feeney, Head of US Businesses, Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob, and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions that we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today's presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com.And now, I'll turn it over to Charlie.Charlie Lowrey: Thank you, Bob. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. As we look back on 2022. I am proud of the progress we've made executing against our strategic priorities. During the year. We continue to transform our business to be less market sensitive and better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We exceeded our $750 million cost savings target one year ahead of schedule, and our rock solid balance sheet provided the financial strength to navigate the evolving macro economic environment. I'll provide an update on each of these areas, beginning with our business transformation. Turning to slide three, during 2022 we reduced the overall market sensitivity of our business by completing the sales of the full service retirement business and the pay lock block as well as the run off of traditional variable annuities.Story continuesWe simultaneously continue to invest in the long-term sustainable growth of our business through programmatic acquisitions, and partnerships in emerging markets. In Africa, we acquired a minority interest in Alex Forbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, investment, and wealth management in South Africa. We also continue to grow our third-party distribution network in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, where third-party distribution now accounts for about 50% of sales and complements our strong Life Planner channel. Additionally, we advanced our vision to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. For example, we completed the second largest pension risk transfer transaction in US market history with IBM and close several major longevity risk transactions, including the $8 billion transaction we completed in the fourth quarter with the Barclays Bank, UK retirement fund.These transactions underscore our leadership in these markets, as well as the strength of our interconnected business model. Our IBM, PRT transaction provided PGIM with more than $8 billion in additional assets under management, and is a good example of how we leverage synergies across our businesses. We see a strong pipeline of opportunities in these markets in the year ahead. We continue to expand our product offerings to meet the increasing customer needs for financial solutions. For example, building on the success of our FlexGuard annuity products, we introduced during the fourth quarter FlexGuard Life, an indexed variable universal life product. In PGIM, we expanded our private loan capabilities through PGIM private capital, including our direct lending capabilities.This broad proprietary origination platform provides our insurance businesses and our institutional clients with unique investment opportunities and is another example of our self-reinforcing business model. We also invested in enhanced customer experiences that blend human touch with advanced technology. In Brazil for example, we expanded our digital sales application to expedite same-day policy delivery and processing with greater automation. In addition, as we administrator for the IBM PRT transaction, we introduced new technology capabilities to expedite the onboarding experience for 100,000 IBM pensioners. And as part of our continued efforts to refine customer experience, we implemented a company-wide initiative to better understand the evolving needs of all our customers around the globe.And in turn, deliver the most effective products and solutions to meet their needs. Moving to slide 4, we achieved $820 million of annual run rate cost savings, exceeding our target of $750 million one year ahead of schedule. We reach this milestone by streamlining and automating the way in which we operate, while improving the customer and employee experience. We leverage new systems and technologies to enhance our digital underwriting, claims and fund processing capabilities, improving efficiency, while reducing customer wait times. For example, for many of our Individual Life customers, we reduce the underwriting time from 22 days to 22 seconds. Our Group Insurance claims processing is now three times faster, and fund verification to process new annuity sales now takes two to three days, down from two to three weeks.We also implemented a hybrid work model for our employees that reduced our U.S. real estate footprint by 50%, equating to approximately $50 million in annual run rate savings. And finally, we adopted a continuous improvement mindset that helps us proactively identify and execute on cost savings opportunities that enhanced customer and employee experiences, and continue to improve our competitiveness going forward. Now to slide 5, our rock solid balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital deployment have helped Prudential navigate financial and macro economic challenges for nearly 150 years. And 2022 was no exception. Our financial strength, including our AA ratings is supported by $4.5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as a high quality, well diversified investment portfolio.We continue to balance investments in the growth of our businesses with returning capital to our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we returned more than $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, for a total of over $7.5 billion since the beginning of 2021. For 2023, our Board has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases, as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 15th consecutive annual dividend increase. Looking ahead, our strategic progress, financial strength and self-reinforcing business system, coupled with a higher interest rate environment position as well to be a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance, and retirement for our customers across the globe.Now, before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to extend a special Thank you to all our employees for their dedication to our customers and our communities. Together, we have made significant progress on our transformation, and are fulfilling our purpose of making lives better, by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. And now, over to Rob, to talk about the fourth quarter financial results, and to provide an update on our business performance.Rob Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US, and International Businesses. I'll begin on slide six. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $4.7 billion or $9.46 per share for 2022 and $1.2 billion or $2.42 per share in the fourth quarter. These results reflect lower variable investment and fee income, partially offset by improved mortality as COVID has transitioned to an endemic phase, an increase in spread income due to rising interest rates, and underlying business growth. In addition, full year results include the strengthening of reserves from our annual assumption update and the gain on the sale of the PALAC Legacy variable annuity block. Our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $1.53 per share and included net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments of $800 million, largely reflecting the impacts of rising interest rates.Corporation, Building, BusinessPhoto by Self Taught on UnsplashThis loss also included a $700 million goodwill impairment due to the reduction in the estimated fair value of assurance. While assurance is making good progress in many areas and had a profitable fourth quarter, the impairment reflects lower growth expectations, higher discount rate applied to future applied to future cashflows reflecting macroeconomic conditions, and lower publicly traded peer evaluations. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager reported fees, primarily due to lower assets under management, resulting from higher rates and equity market declines. Results of our US businesses primarily reflected less favorable variable investment income, partially offset by the impact of higher rates on spread income and more favorable underwriting.The decrease in earnings and our international businesses primarily reflected lower spread income, largely due to less favorable variable investment income and less favorable underwriting including elevated surrenders in Japan through the depreciation of the yen. Turning to slide seven, PGIM, our global investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives including real estate and private credit. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with more than 79% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five, and 10 year periods. For 2022, PGIM experienced positive institutional net flows that were more than offset by retail outflows, primarily in fixed income, consistent with industry trends due to the rising rate environment.In the fourth quarter, PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $11.7 billion, driven by public fixed income strategies across institutional and retail clients. Institutional net outflows were driven by a few large client redemptions, while retail net outflows reflected the impact of the rising interest rate environment on retail flows across the industry. As the investment engine of Prudential, success and growth of PGIM and of our US and International Insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers.Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that totaled $13 billion during 2022 as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow our alternatives business, which has assets in excess of $230 billion across private credit and real estate equity and debt and benefits from our global scale and market leading positions. Notably, PGIM's private businesses deployed nearly $43 billion of gross capital in 2022. Turning to slide 8. Our US Businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investments spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift towards higher growth and less market sensitive products and markets, enhance our customer experience while reducing costs by amplifying the use of capabilities and self-service tools and further expand our addressable markets.Retirement Strategies achieved robust sales in fourth quarter and full year 2022 across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our Institutional Retirement business has market leading capabilities with full year sales of almost $32 billion driving record account values at the end of the year. This includes being selected for a 50% participation in a $16 billion pension risk transfer transaction and our fourth largest international reinsurance transaction of $8 billion in the fourth quarter. In Individual Retirement, product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard income, representing over $12 billion of sales since inception, as well as increased fixed annuity sales.Our Individual Life sales were consistent through the year and reflect our earlier product pivot strategy, with variable life products representing approximately 70% of sales for the year. And our Group Insurance benefits ratio has improved during the year from lower COVID mortality. Turning to slide 9. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs.In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customer's needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Our International Businesses experienced their highest sales since the third quarter of 2020, including record sales in Brazil. Compared to the prior year quarter, Gibraltar sales were up 20% mainly driven by the life consultant channel primarily from higher US dollar sales. Life Planner sales were also up 17%, driven by continued momentum in Brazil's third-party distribution channel, as well as higher sales in Japan. As we look ahead, we're well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security.We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses in markets, delivering industry leading customer experiences, and creating the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken.Ken Tanji: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2023 relative to our fourth quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.42 on an after tax basis. To get a sense of how our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income was below expectations in the fourth quarter by $125 million. Next, we adjust underwriting experience by net $60 million, as we normalize for fourth quarter experience and expect seasonality in the first quarter. And last, we expect other items to increase adjusted operating income by $91 million, primarily due to seasonally elevated expenses in the fourth quarter.These items combined get us to a baseline of $3.01 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.07. The key takeaway is that, our underlying earnings power has improved due to the business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we as we look forward, we have included other considerations for 2023 in the appendix. Turning to slide 11. I'll now provide an update on the adoption of the new accounting standard for long duration insurance contracts which went into effect on January 1. The new standard applies to our GAAP financial statements and will have no direct effect on our statutory financial statements, cash flows or dividend capacity.We estimate that as of September 30, 2022, GAAP equity will increase by approximately $15 billion comprised of two components. Accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, will increase by approximately $17 billion, primarily due to remeasurement of long duration liabilities with higher discount rates in our Japan business. Retained earnings will be reduced by approximately $2 billion, reflecting the reclassification of non-performance risk gains from retained earnings AOCI and other changes in reserves. Also of note, GAAP equity will continue to exclude certain unrealized insurance margins from products subject to LDTI. As of September 30, 2022, the estimated after-tax unrealized insurance margins related to those products are approximately $50 billion, primarily in our Japan business.These margins are an important factor in determining financial strength and assessing profitability. And finally, we do not expect significant impacts from LDTI on our total underlying earnings power, as impacts across our businesses will largely offset. Turning to slide 12. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.5 billion, at the high end of our liquidity target range. We have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to slide 13 and in summary. We are transforming our businesses for sustainable growth.We exceeded our targeted cost savings one year ahead of plan and will maintain our discipline and continuous improvement mindset going forward. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.See also Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield and 16 Largest Photography Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

RNR, United Rentals, Inc. URI, ATI Inc. ATI, Wabash National Corp. WNC and O-I Glass, Inc. OI.How to Profit from Relative Price Strength StrategyFollowing a highly disappointing 2022, Wall Street ended the first month of 2023 with a solid rally. As a proof of this, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — posted the best January since 2019. In particular, favorable data for several measures of inflation, various soft economic prints and a resilient labor market propped up investor sentiment.The recent numbers clearly indicate that wage rate, a major source of current inflation, is declining as expected by the Fed. To add to this, nonfarm payrolls from the U.S. government for the month of January bowled over expectations, while the unemployment rate has dropped to a 54-year low.But this robust labor market gives permission to Fed Chair Powell and the other officials to keep raising interest rates. Instead of the central bank holding pat at a 4.75% high end of the Fed funds rate, now it’s much more likely the Fed will go to 5% and beyond.In other words, we are not out of the woods yet, with softness in consumer spending and looming signs of slowdown playing spoilsport. Therefore, extremely volatile trading in U.S. markets is expected to continue for some time.In the current jittery market environment, investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyEarnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential for determining whether a stock’s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average. If a stock’s performance is lacking that of the broader groups, despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.Story continuesIt’s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industry or benchmark. This is because betting on a winner always proves to be lucrative.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies.

As a proof of this, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — posted the best January since 2019. In particular, favorable data for several measures of inflation, various soft economic prints and a resilient labor market propped up investor sentiment.The recent numbers clearly indicate that wage rate, a major source of current inflation, is declining as expected by the Fed. To add to this, nonfarm payrolls from the U.S. government for the month of January bowled over expectations, while the unemployment rate has dropped to a 54-year low.But this robust labor market gives permission to Fed Chair Powell and the other officials to keep raising interest rates. Instead of the central bank holding pat at a 4.75% high end of the Fed funds rate, now it’s much more likely the Fed will go to 5% and beyond.In other words, we are not out of the woods yet, with softness in consumer spending and looming signs of slowdown playing spoilsport. Therefore, extremely volatile trading in U.S. markets is expected to continue for some time.In the current jittery market environment, investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 0.88% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.73%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 4.59%.Coming into today, shares of the software maker had lost 2.16% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 14.64%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.83%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Oracle as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Oracle to post earnings of $1.19 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 5.31%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $12.39 billion, up 17.9% from the prior-year quarter.ORCL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.91 per share and revenue of $49.74 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +0.2% and +17.19%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Oracle. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.17% lower. Oracle is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Oracle has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.67 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 28.82.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that ORCL has a PEG ratio of 2.21.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Oracle (ORCL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.23 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on March 9, 2023.ORCL has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.15%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19.ORCL is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Cisco Systems is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 15, 2023. CSCO's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.87 a share six days from its next earnings release.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cisco Systems is $0.86, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.66%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ORCL and CSCO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Real Estate Companies in the World.The global real estate industry involves the buying, selling, and management of properties such as residential homes, commercial buildings, and industrial spaces. It is a complex and diverse industry that includes a wide range of participants, including real estate agents and brokers, property developers, landlords and property managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and financial institutions. As is true for most other industries, the world of real estate is prone to influence by a number of factors, including economic conditions, demographic trends, government policies, and technological advancements. Following a pandemic-fueled course correction, the global real estate industry faces transformational shifts in how buildings will be used, valued, and transacted in 2023 and beyond. This is evidenced by Deloitte's 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook, which revealed that only 40% of global real estate chief financial officers (CFOs) expected to finish 2022 with higher revenues than last year, and 33% anticipated cuts to expenses, citing sustained high inflation, workforce management, and cyber as the top risks to financial performance.According to a report by GrandViewResearch, the global real estate market size was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030. The market is expected to grow at a healthy pace during the forecast period, owing to the rising population and a desire for personal household space. As of 2021, the commercial real estate space was estimated to be the most important element driving industry expansion. Additionally, in terms of revenue, rental real estate types dominated the market with a share of 52.1% in 2021. This is attributable to rising home prices in developed countries, owing to which there is a rise in the number of renters, favoring the segment growth.Story continuesThe pandemic caused significant changes in consumer demand, which led retailers to modernize their systems to better adapt to these changes. This includes improved analytics and strategies to maintain customer loyalty in response to changing consumer preferences. This holds especially true for Gen Z as it is highly dependent on technology and relies more on the internet and social media to make purchasing and lifestyle decisions. Since Gen Z has experienced technology their entire lives, leasing and marketing campaigns for real estate services should incorporate the use of technology to reach this generation where they are most active, which includes social media, or any other internet source.20 Most Valuable Real Estate Companies in the Worldjason-dent-w3eFhqXjkZE-unsplashOur Methodology We used stock screeners to identify the most valuable real estate companies in the world based on market capitalization as of February 1, 2023.

And that comes hot on the heels of major layoff news at Hasbro. Soz has toys on his brain today for his take.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, definitely I do. And I think if you want to tie up what we're hearing from the toy industry, it is essentially this, economy slowing. A lot of these companies have pushed through higher prices. Consumers saying, well, we just don't-- not going to buy these toys. We're going to wait till they're about 70% off.But let's see the high-level news here. Mattel earnings last night, stock under pressure, as Julie just mentioned. Sales down 22%, that is not the normal rates of growth we've been seeing from Mattel over the past two years. So I think that has a lot of investors spooked a little bit and has surprised them. Inventories up 15%, in large part because those sales really fell off the map. Gross profit margins down 620 basis points year over year.Interesting to hear on the earnings call last night really two things from Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz, frequent guest on our program. Says, our fourth quarter results were below expectations as the macroeconomic environment was more challenging than anticipated. And to that end, I think taking a more sober tone on the outlook for the toy industry this year.Ynon noting that the-- he sees the toy industry flat to slightly up this year in terms of sales, which is-- would mark a deceleration from recent growth rates.But it's not just Mattel. A couple of weeks ago, Hasbro just came out with just another stinker of a pre-earnings announcement, said they are canning 15% of their workforce. Fourth quarter sales crashed 17% there for Hasbro. They will report their earnings on February 17. I can't imagine they will have anything good to say, given the pre-announcement like this.Story continuesI also caught up too with another friend of our show, the-- James Zahn, the editor in chief over at ""Toy Book"" who is just probably one of the most interesting-- or probably the best person to reach out to in all things toys. He told me a couple problems for Hasbro outside of its just debacle of Wizards of the Coast and their various gaming efforts.One, they recently moved to no plastic packaging for certain toys. And what that is-- do-- you have the differences right here. On the right, you see old school Hasbro packaging. People like to see their toys, what they look like when they're in the stores.On the left, you're now seeing the new packaging. Yes, you have the toy on the outside of the box. But you can't actually see the workings, the mechanisms of the toys. And James is telling me that is leading to sales pressure for some of Hasbro's products. Also telling me that the Hasbro base price on the 6-inch action figure jumped from $19.99 to $22 then $24 and then, in some cases, $30.That is a large-- that is some serious inflation on price-sensitive toys here. And parents are just not going to buy these things. And that's why you see inventory in the channel starting to really back up.My take is this-- and maybe not a shocker, just given my really negative commentary here. There's no reason to go near these stocks. Yeah, that's not a buy or sell decision. That's just basic-level analysis. You have sales falling off a cliff for toys. You have high inventory levels. You have retailers like Walmart and Target not placing a lot of replenishment orders right now.And it is unlikely that the toy industry really gets back to growth maybe until the holiday season of this year.JULIE HYMAN: I didn't recognize some of those toys. Did you recognize the guys that look kind of like He-Man? But I don't know. Maybe that was He-Man.BRAD SMITH: The early ones? No, I didn't I didn't recognize too many of them. I recognized the ones towards the end, but that was it. And the toys are noticeably smaller too, even on screen.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, do you know this series?BRIAN SOZZI: They--JULIE HYMAN: I'm not familiar.BRIAN SOZZI: They don't make toys, I would argue, like they used to. I personally think the quality has gone down. I used to be a little bit of a toy geek.JULIE HYMAN: Well, forget about the quality. I don't-- maybe this is series the kids are watching.BRAD SMITH: That's from ""Jurassic Park.""JULIE HYMAN: That I recognize. That's a dinosaur.BRAD SMITH: Who was that dude before? I don't know who he is.BRIAN SOZZI: I've got a good example for you, real quick. So I bought my nephew a new-- for Christmas, a Pound Puppy, Pound Puppies, stuffed animal. I remember having them when I was a kid. I had four of them. I bought him two.And you could tell, like the eyes on the Pound Puppy, they didn't look right. They were cheaper quality. The stuffing felt a little different. It's just not the toy I remember from the '80s. And it was disappointing. And I don't know if he still has it. They like playing with the boxes at that age. But still, I was disappointed. I wanted more from the Pound Puppy.JULIE HYMAN: I'm very sorry.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I was disappointed actually.JULIE HYMAN: I'm sorry. I feel like--BRIAN SOZZI: I'm getting sad now, actually.JULIE HYMAN: I feel like we've got a puppy eyes situation coming on.]"
350,3fc86795-7f30-34b8-a8ad-f0356276a99f,HAS,2023-02-10,Hasbro (HAS) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-earnings-expected-grow-know-150103205.html,1675954863,STORY,['HAS'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Hasbro (HAS) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 16, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis toy maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.68 billion, down 16.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hasbro?For Hasbro, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.33%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hasbro will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Hasbro would post earnings of $1.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.42, delivering a surprise of -7.19%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Hasbro doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.06 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 139.39%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this a maker of bank teller machines, retail systems and other equipment would post earnings of $0.28 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.11, delivering a surprise of -139.29%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Diebold Nixdorf , which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, posted revenues of $968.8 million for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.06 billion. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Diebold Nixdorf shares have added about 90.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Diebold Nixdorf?While Diebold Nixdorf has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Diebold Nixdorf: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.18 on $886.18 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.41 on $3.77 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial Transaction Services is currently in the bottom 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 15.This banking and payment technologies company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Fidelity National Information Services' revenues are expected to be $3.68 billion, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:YUM) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 8, 2023Operator: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the Yum! Brands, Inc. 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Charlie and I'll be coordinating the call today. . I will now hand over to your host, Gavin Felder, Chief Strategy Officer and Interim Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Gavin, please go ahead.Gavin Felder: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I will be covering for Jodi Dyer while she is on maternity leave. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions. Before we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.In addition, please refer to our earnings release and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call. Please note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Please also note the following financial reporting treatment related to our exit from Russia. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the second quarter, we elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics. For the purposes of this call, all references to system sales growth and unit growth results for the quarter are adjusted to remove our Russia business from the prior year base.Story continuesThis negatively impacted our worldwide unit growth by 2 percentage points and our worldwide system sales growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year by 2 percentage points. These units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and thus did not impact same-store sales results for the fourth quarter or full year. All GAAP figures reported continue to include the impact of Russia operations for KFC for the full quarter and year, and for Pizza Hut prior to our transfer of that business to a local operator in the second quarter. These GAAP figures primarily include royalty revenues from continued franchise operations and G&amp;A to support our Russia business. Additionally, our GAAP G&amp;A includes expenses incurred relating to the transfer of ownership of the business.As a result of our decision to exit our Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segments in which they are earned subsequent to the start of the conflict to corporate and unallocated and reflected those net operating profits as a special item within the other income and expense line. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Looking ahead, our first quarter earnings will be released on May 3, 2023, with the conference call on the same day. Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.David Gibbs: Thank you, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. 2022 truly was a landmark year for Yum!. In spite of the challenges from significant spikes in commodity inflation and pockets of labor shortages, our world-class teams and franchisees partnered together to deliver another year of amazing growth. We achieved record-breaking industry development, opening 4,560 gross units that translated to nearly 3,100 net new units, beating our prior record set just last year and ending the year with over 55,000 restaurants globally. For the full year, system sales were up 8% and core operating profit was up 6%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year. Perhaps the most impressive performance came from Taco Bell, finishing 2022 with same-store sales growth of 8%.Taco Bell also bucked the industry trend on margins, holding company operated margins flat from last year despite elevated industry-wide cost pressure. KFC International delivered a record year, opening approximately 2,400 gross units and nearly 2,000 net new units, translating to 9% unit growth. Combined, these 2 parts of the business account for approximately 80% of our divisional operating profit. We finished the year on a high note with system sales growth of 10% in Q4, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth, contributing to 22% core operating profit growth, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year. Such incredible performance under highly challenging conditions underscores the tremendous confidence I have that even after a remarkable 25 years of growth as a public company, our best days are clearly ahead of us.Before I discuss our 2022 results in detail, I wanted to give a brief update on our planned exit from Russia. As mentioned during our Q3 call, we have a signed purchase agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian KFC restaurants, operating system and master franchise rights to an existing KFC Russia franchisee. We expect the transaction to close following satisfaction of all closing conditions. Following the closing, we will have ceased our corporate presence in Russia. I also want to acknowledge the devastating impact of the earthquake that happened earlier this week, affecting our teams in Turkey. Our people remain our #1 priority, and I want to recognize the effort from our franchisee, Ilkem Sahin, as he and his team worked to prioritize people's safety as they navigate through this tragedy.As we shared at our recent Investor Day, our strategy is guided by our Recipe for Good Growth. And today, we will discuss our 2022 results through the lens of that framework. I will talk about 2 of our growth drivers: namely our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short; and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I'll provide an update on our efforts to drive the good agenda across our brands and our business. Chris will then share the details of our fourth quarter financial results before discussing our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capabilities growth drivers. I'll start by discussing our iconic R.E.D. brands. Beginning with the KFC division, which accounts for 49% of our divisional operating profit.KFC full year 2022 system sales grew 9%, driven by 7% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. Q4 system sales for KFC increased 10%, thanks to 7% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. Results were unfavorably impacted by COVID-related challenges in China. Excluding China, our KFC business continues to grow at an unbelievable pace with same-store sales growing 9% in the quarter, driven in part by our world-class franchisees and continued impressive momentum in our emerging markets. At KFC's International business, which represents 44% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales grew 11%. Several markets showed stellar results. In Japan, for example, KFC is synonymous with the Christmas holiday family meal. And this year, Japan system sales over the Christmas period grew 16% year-over-year.Africa drove double-digit same-store sales growth in the quarter and continues to benefit from several customer-facing digital initiatives. To build on that success, our South Africa team will continue to roll out kiosks with a goal of installing them in 95% of our stores by 2023. Moving on to our Taco Bell division, which represents 35% of our divisional operating profit. On a global basis, full year system sales grew 11%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. This team continues to deliver industry-leading results, and coupled with the incredible array of talent in place and our strong franchisee partnerships, it should be no surprise that Taco Bell earned the top spot on Entrepreneur magazine's Franchise 500 Ranking for the third year running.Moving on to our fourth quarter results. Taco Bell U.S. grew system sales 14%, underpinned by an exceptional 11% same-store sales growth. The powerful momentum from previous quarters continued with the relaunch of the cult classic Mexican Pizza for which we provided early access to our loyalty members. We ended the year with around 45 million Mexican Pizzas sold, an impressive number considering they were only available for 4 months of the year. We also made encouraging progress in our breakfast layer, building on high-profile branding partnerships such as Doja Cat in Q1 and Davante Adams in Q3. Taco Bell brought in Pete Davidson to help drive consumer buzz for breakfast. This led to 9% transaction growth for the daypart. Overall, Taco Bell did a terrific job this quarter at balancing both ends of the consumer spectrum by featuring premium products that our consumers crave, such as the Grilled Cheese Burrito with sharply priced items like Nacho Fries.At Taco Bell International, Q4 system sales grew 23%, driven by 29% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. Q4 closed a truly breakthrough year for our international business, which has now crossed the 1,000-unit mark. To put this speed into some historical context, Taco Bell International has built 40% of its current estate within the last 2 years. It wasn't just our development engine on fire this year, many of our markets reached double-digit same-store sales growth in 2022, including some of our largest markets with India, up 33%; Thailand, up 36%; and Spain, up 20%. Next, at the Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 16% of our divisional operating profit, our full year system sales grew 3%, led by 4% unit growth and flat same-store sales growth.Pizza Hut International, which accounts for 9% of our divisional operating profit, achieved system sales growth of 4%, driven by 6% unit growth and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the fourth quarter. Results were heavily impacted by the ongoing COVID-related challenges in China. Ex-China, our same-store sales remained healthy, growing 4%. Several markets showed noticeable strength, including Japan, where same-store sales grew 10%, owing to a strong holiday performance and recent product launch of Tuscani pasta bowls that featured a local flavored twist. At Pizza Hut U.S., which accounts for 7% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales grew 5%, driven by 4% same-store sales growth and flat unit growth. The strength in the quarter was driven by a combination of factors that included new advertising to highlight both premium and value offerings, growth partnerships with aggregators and the success of the new Melts product.Melts over-indexed to predinner time frames and individual occasion tickets and helped to recover the lower household income base due to its strong value proposition. Lastly, 5 distinct national marketing campaigns on Uber Eats and DoorDash helped aggregator transactions grow 30% in the quarter. Lastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, the team continues to make progress on setting up the business for long-term growth. Habit's burgeoning digital channel finished the year strong with digital mix ending at 35%, a truly impressive level after only launching in 2020. I'm pleased to share that Habit is now 18% franchised, which is up 5 points from last year. With $2 million average unit volumes and a compelling growth strategy, I'm confident in the long-term growth of our newest brand.And now on to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent Growth drivers. Our hallmark at Yum! continues to be our people first culture, which drives retention and recruitment of amazing talent. Highlights in 2022 included bringing our top 250 leaders from around the world together for a Global Leadership Summit and celebrating the important role our world-class talent has played as we marked our 25th anniversary as a publicly traded company. Internally, we continued to promote talent naming a President of the Habit Burger Grill and a new President of KFC U.S. Externally, we attracted top talent, welcoming a new Global Chief Brand Officer for Taco Bell, a new Global Chief Operating and Transformation Officer for Pizza Hut and a new Chief Corporate Affairs Officer for Yum!.When it comes to all the good we do, we released our 2021 Recipe for Good report during the year, detailing our strong progress around our 3 priority areas. With our science-based targets to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 46% by 2030, we decreased emissions against our 2019 baseline by approximately 24% for company-owned buildings and our corporate restaurants, while our franchisees decreased emissions by 20%. Regarding better packaging, we published a new global harmonized packaging policy with a focus on eliminating unnecessary packaging, shifting to more sustainable materials and supporting better recovery and recycling systems. We increased the number of women in senior leadership globally to 42%, which keeps us on track to achieve gender parity and leadership globally by 2030 in alignment with Paradigm for Parity.We were pleased Yum! received industry-leading rankings on the carbon disclosure project and inclusion on the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America, the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and Newsweek's list for America's Most Responsible Companies and America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity. To wrap up, I'm thrilled with our 2022 performance, particularly given many of the unpredictable obstacles our team had to navigate. Our results continue to reflect a resilient, diversified business and the strength of our portfolio, led by our iconic brands. I'm confident we will continue to execute with superior performance and deliver industry-leading growth, all of which will help to maximize value to our shareholders. With that, Chris, over to you.Nils Versemann / Shutterstock.comChristopher Turner: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by our capital strategy. As David mentioned, 2022 was a year of huge milestones for Yum!. The resilience and winning mindset shown by our teams around the world helped us open a record-breaking 4,560 gross units or 3,076 net new units on a full year basis. These development numbers put full year unit growth at 6%. System sales for the year grew 8%, driven by strong international same-store sales growth for KFC and another stellar performance from Taco Bell. Full year core operating profit grew 6%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year.Fourth quarter system sales growth of 10% was in line with the update we shared at our Investor Day, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Core operating profit grew 22%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year. Reported operating profit included a negative $42 million foreign currency translation impact in the fourth quarter and a negative $118 million impact to the full year. Ex special general and administrative expenses came in at $357 million and approximately $1.1 billion for the full year. Taco Bell store level margins were 23%, flat year-over-year. Taco Bell paid additional discretionary bonuses to its store-level employees, given the strong performance for the year, which impacted quarterly margins by approximately 50 basis points.Taco Bell's full year store level margin was 24%, near the upper end of its 23% to 24% historical pre-COVID margin range. Fourth quarter ex special EPS was $1.31, a 29% increase versus the prior year. EPS growth was positively impacted by core operating profit growth of 22% and a lower current year tax rate. This was partially offset by the year-over-year impact of a current year mark-to-market loss on our equity investment in a franchisee in India, lapping a prior year gain as well as the aforementioned negative impact of foreign currency. The ex special tax rate in the quarter was 12%, due in large part to the release of a valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets that we now believe we will be able to utilize. Our full year ex special tax rate was 21%, in line with our full year expectations of 21% to 23%.Now let me share greater detail on our fourth quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. This quarter, we opened 1,830 gross new units, resulting in 4,560 gross units opened for the full year or the equivalent of more than 1 new restaurant every 2 hours. Nearly 90% of new store openings in 2022 occurred outside the United States across 112 countries, proof that our diversified development engine is stronger than ever. Starting with KFC, the team opened 997 gross new units in the fourth quarter with China, India and Thailand leading the charge. The Pizza Hut division had incredible development results, opening 571 gross new units in Q4 with 5 countries contributing more than 25 units, namely India, Indonesia, Canada, China and Turkey.The Taco Bell division opened 253 gross new units in Q4 and 496 restaurants for the full year. In fact, Taco Bell U.S. opened 250 gross new units this year, the second highest annual amount ever. For 2022, Taco Bell International set a record with 246 gross new units, exceeding the prior record of 179 units set last year. I'm thrilled to report we crossed the 1,000 Taco Bell unit threshold internationally and we soon expect to have 4 countries that have over 100 units with China joining Spain, India and the U.K. Lastly, Habit added 33 gross new units in 2022, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 10%. This level of growth, which includes a significant number of company-owned units create some short-term noise in company-owned restaurant margins due to the inclusion of preopening expenses and the depressed margins that are normal during the initial months of operations before new stores reach maturity.Average margins for Habit stores opened more than a year remain much stronger than our overall reported Habit company store margin. To finish with development, as we head into 2023, we remain confident that we will maintain our strong momentum. We exited 2022 with record site registrations for new units at Taco Bell U.S., and we have over 80% of 2023 planned units at KFC and Pizza Hut outside of China committed with well-capitalized, growth-ready franchise partners. Next, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities and the 3 pillars of our digital strategy: Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. I'll start with an update on our Easy Experiences pillar, which focuses on delivering seamless customer experiences through proprietary technology and dedicated operational programs.In 2022, we expanded the rollout of Tictuk, our conversational commerce and e-commerce platform across our network and finished the year with Tictuk in over 3,200 stores across 49 markets. We processed millions of digital orders in 2022 with Tictuk continuing to prove it can bring in incremental customers and drive digital sales. This is evidenced by the chat ordering launch in KFC Mexico where more than 90% of users who transacted on the chat channel had previously not placed a digital order on other channels. We plan to roll out Tictuk to more than 1,000 new stores in 2023, including its white label e-commerce platform, which went live in Pizza Hut Chile and Taco Bell Canada in Q4 2022. Moving on to our Easy Operations pillar, which centers on the team member and franchise partner experience.The rollout of Dragontail is ramping up in Pizza Hut U.S. with over 450 stores onboarded by the end of 2022 and plans to reach up to 1,000 stores by the end of Q1. Globally, we expect to have Dragontail in over 7,000 stores by the end of 2023. At Pizza Hut U.S., we have completed the integration of 2 major aggregator channels into our point-of-sale system. And at Taco Bell U.S., we have fully integrated our delivery as a service partner into our store's technology system. These integrations are important in helping our team members process delivery orders with new levels of ease. Lastly, I'll cover our Easy Insights pillar, which leverages the power of data and analytics to allow our teams to make smarter decisions. I want to highlight 2 key initiatives that our Yum! decision sciences team have been working on, namely Recommended Ordering and Cook Schedule.Recommended Ordering is an artificial intelligence, machine learning module that predicts and recommends the quantity of product for a restaurant manager to order each week with the goal of reducing product waste and intra-store transfers of inventory. The product has been rolled out to 3,000 U.S. stores across Taco Bell and KFC. Cook Schedule is a similar module that helps predict the correct amount of food and timing to cook product to accurately meet demand. The team is working primarily with KFC on this initiative with plans to pilot in an international market soon. Finally, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 5x, including a small balance on our revolving credit facility that was used to support share repurchases in the fourth quarter.We will enter 2023 with no significant maturities until 2026 and approximately 94% of our debt fixed, excluding our revolving credit facility balance. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and continuously evaluating the optimal use of our excess cash. To that end, I am also pleased to announce that this week, our Board of Directors approved an increased quarterly dividend of $0.605. Our capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $99 million. Our net capital expenditures for the year came in at $206 million, reflecting $73 million in refranchising proceeds and roughly $279 million in gross CapEx. With regard to our share buyback program, we repurchased 4.1 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $119 per share, totaling approximately $486 million.For the full year, we repurchased 10 million shares at an average price of $119 per share and totaling $1.2 billion. Overall, we are extremely pleased with these results given the complexities our teams faced. Navigating such challenges with industry-leading performance affirms the confidence we have to deliver our recently raised long-term growth algorithm of 5% unit growth, 7% system sales growth and at least 8% core operating profit growth. Looking to 2023, we wanted to provide a few guardrails for modeling purposes. First, we expect to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm with healthy unit growth momentum continuing into 2023. We expect Taco Bell company operated margins to be in line with full year 2022 margins, and we expect our 2023 G&amp;A to be approximately $1.15 billion, in line with the guidance provided at Investor Day.In terms of the shape for the year, the year-over-year growth in G&amp;A will be highest in the first half, largely owing to the timing of our G&amp;A expense plan across the year. Based on rate expectations as of today, we expect our interest expense to be up approximately 10% year-over-year and for our leverage ratio to drift modestly lower in 2023. Finally, we expect our full year tax rate to be 21% to 23%. To close, we are extremely proud of the performance of our brands over the past year and look forward with excitement to deliver another year of compelling growth and shareholder value in 2023. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions.See also 12 Countries that Export the Most Tobacco and 15 Countries that Export the Most Beef.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Say goodbye to Kentucky Fried Chicken wings, popcorn chicken, Nashville Hot sauce, strawberry lemonade, and chocolate chip cookies. But to be clear, KFC's original Colonel Sanders recipe with 11 herbs and spices stays.The YUM! Brands subsidiary has been undergoing ""a menu simplification"" to increase efficiency, ease the ordering experience, and allow the company to better focus on innovation.""It's really to deliver our most popular products perfectly each time and to actually make room for new products."" KFC U.S. Director Brittany Wilson told Yahoo Finance.The changes are expected to roll out over the next month on a case-by-case basis to ""make room for this big spring of innovation that KFC has coming,""The removed items were chosen because they ""weren't available on a national scale or that [they] haven't necessarily been growing on a national sales mix,"" Wilson said.KFC U.S. new national menu (Courtesy: KFC)Justin Stewart, a KFC franchise owner and COO of Stewart Restaurant Group, said the menu updates at his restaurant have already cut time for employees to pack orders and improve drive-thru rates.“Our team members have been able to package orders more quickly, due to having less items on our pack line. As a result, we’ve reduced our drive-through order time by 11 seconds.""According to Intouch Insight's 2022 Annual Drive-Thru Study, KFC's average wait time was 63.6 seconds, while total service time was roughly 4 minutes, or 239.02 seconds. On average, there were nearly 2 cars in line.Accuracy also improved, per Stewart. ""By removing less popular menu items, we’ve improved order accuracy and product availability overall, and created space in back of house.

On-the-go trends that were popular before the COVID-19 pandemic are back too.""As we see macros in the consumer landscape shift back to a little bit more pre-COVID times, portability is key and having products that consumers can take with them on-the-go, will certainly be an extension of of how we're looking at it sandwiches going forward.""Wilson added that younger consumers favor boneless products.

359,5faa6c0f-abb1-3b8a-8c76-0ae592440439,MCD,2023-02-10,McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) shareholders have earned a 13% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-nyse-mcd-shareholders-earned-110046919.html,1676026846,STORY,['MCD'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) share price is up 65% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 44% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 4.4% , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for McDonald's While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, McDonald's achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5.6% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 11% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on McDonald's' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for McDonald's the TSR over the last 5 years was 86%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that McDonald's shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.4% over the last year. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 13% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for McDonald's   you should know about.McDonald's is not the only stock insiders are buying.

However, higher interest rates do dampen growth, and no doubt the U.S. economy is currently facing the threat of a recession soon. But despite such trying times, the labor market in the United States remains resilient.January’s job reports were astounding all around. Nonfarm payrolls surged by 517,000 last month, crushing analysts’ forecast of only 187,000 job additions, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics added. Notably, January’s job additions were more than the average monthly gain of 401,000 last year.Moreover, job gains were robust in January, with almost all the major industries, including white-collar business services, leisure and hospitality, and healthcare adding jobs. But it was the hotels and restaurants industry in particular that led the way with 128,000 job additions.Many tech companies in recent times announced layoffs, but that didn’t derail overall job additions in the United States. What’s more, hiring was much stronger during the latter half of last year than anticipated. From July through December 2022, the U.S. economy created an additional 304,000 jobs. In the months of November and December, job additions were also revised higher.What’s more, in January, the unemployment rate slipped to its lowest level since 1969, and now stands at 3.4%. Simultaneously, the labor force participation rate has moved up to 62.4%.This indicates that American citizens still believe that the economy will chug along and companies will do well in the near term.Story continuesNow, with jobs being added at a strong clip in January amid optimism about further economic growth, shares of staffing companies are positioned to gain. This is because staffing companies are direct beneficiaries of job additions.By the way, the Employment Trends Index of the Conference Board, increased to 118.74 in January from an upwardly revised 117.06 in December.

Normalized gross margin was 26.6 percent compared with 30.2 percent in the prior year period.Reported operating loss was $273 million compared with operating income of $170 million in the prior year period. Non-cash impairment charges of $326 million and $60 million were incurred in the current and prior year periods, respectively, related to goodwill and intangible assets. Reported operating margin was negative 11.9 percent compared with positive 6.1 percent in the prior year period, as the impact of lower net sales, the impairment charge and significant headwinds from inflation and foreign exchange more than offset benefits from FUEL productivity savings and pricing.

The normalized tax benefit was $5 million compared with a tax provision of $38 million in the prior year period.The company reported net loss of $249 million, or $0.60 diluted loss per share, compared with net income of $98 million, or $0.23 diluted earnings per share, in the prior year period.Normalized net income was $65 million, or $0.16 normalized diluted earnings per share, compared with $182 million, or $0.42 normalized diluted earnings per share, in the prior year period.An explanation of non-GAAP measures disclosed in this release and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP results to comparable GAAP measures are included in the tables attached to this release.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowDuring full year 2022, operating cash outflow was $272 million compared with operating cash flow of $884 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decline in operating income and an increase in working capital use, largely due to higher inventory levels driven by a pullback in retailer orders and slowing consumer demand, and lower accounts payable due to the timing of supply plan reductions. The company reduced its inventories by more than $400 million between the third quarter 2022 and the fourth quarter 2022.In October 2022, the company redeemed its remaining 3.9 percent senior notes due April 2023 for a total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion. At the end of 2022, Newell Brands had cash and cash equivalents of $287 million and net debt outstanding of $5.1 billion.Fourth Quarter 2022 Operating Segment ResultsThe Commercial Solutions segment generated net sales of $355 million compared with $503 million in the prior year period, reflecting core sales decline of 6.3 percent, the impact of the sale of the CH&amp;S business at the end of the first quarter 2022 and unfavorable foreign exchange. Reported operating income was $15 million, or 4.2 percent of sales, compared with $10 million, or 2.0 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $16 million, or 4.5 percent of sales, versus $46 million, or 9.1 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Home Appliances segment generated net sales of $399 million compared with $541 million in the prior year period, reflecting core sales decline of 17.3 percent, as well as the impact of exits from certain low margin categories and unfavorable foreign exchange. Reported operating loss was $24 million, or negative 6.0 percent of sales, compared with operating income of $35 million, or 6.5 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $1 million, or 0.3 percent of sales, versus $41 million, or 7.6 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Home Solutions segment generated net sales of $636 million compared with $759 million in the prior year period, reflecting core sales decline of 12.8 percent, the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and the exit of 43 Yankee Candle retail locations during the year. Core sales declined across both the Home Fragrance and Food business units. Reported operating loss was $291 million, or negative 45.8 percent of sales, including the impact of a non-cash impairment charge of $321 million, compared with operating income of $124 million, or 16.3 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $41 million, or 6.4 percent of sales, versus $133 million, or 17.5 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Learning &amp; Development segment generated net sales of $684 million compared with $698 million in the prior year period, as core sales growth of 2.6 percent was more than offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Core sales grew in Writing and were relatively flat in Baby. Reported operating income was $88 million, or 12.9 percent of sales, including the impact of a non-cash impairment charge of $5 million, compared with $76 million, or 10.9 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $98 million, or 14.3 percent of sales, versus $107 million, or 15.3 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Outdoor &amp; Recreation segment generated net sales of $211 million compared with $304 million in the prior year period, reflecting core sales decline of 21.0 percent, as well as the impact of exits from certain low margin categories and unfavorable foreign exchange. Reported operating loss was $14 million, or negative 6.6 percent of sales, compared with $1 million, or negative 0.3 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating loss was $4 million, or negative 1.9 percent of sales, versus normalized operating income of $8 million, or 2.6 percent of sales, in the prior year period.Full Year 2022 Operating ResultsNet sales for the full year ended December 31, 2022 were $9.5 billion, a decline of 10.7 percent compared with $10.6 billion in the prior year, reflecting core sales decline of 3.4 percent, the impact of the sale of the CH&amp;S business at the end of the first quarter 2022, unfavorable foreign exchange, as well as category and retail store exits.Reported gross margin was 30.0 percent compared with 31.8 percent in the prior year, as the impact of fixed cost deleveraging and significant headwinds from foreign exchange and inflation, particularly related to sourced finished goods, transportation and labor, more than offset the benefits from pricing and FUEL productivity savings. Normalized gross margin was 30.2 percent compared with 32.0 percent in the prior year.Reported operating income was $312 million, or 3.3 percent of sales, compared with $1.0 billion, or 9.6 percent of sales in the prior year. Non-cash impairment charges of $474 million and $60 million were incurred in the current and prior years, respectively, related to goodwill and intangible assets. Normalized operating income was $956 million, or 10.1 percent of sales, compared with $1.2 billion, or 11.7 percent of sales, in the prior year.Interest expense was $235 million compared with $256 million in the prior year, largely reflecting higher interest income.The company reported a tax benefit of $40 million compared with a tax provision of $138 million in the prior year, largely reflecting an increase in discrete tax benefits. Normalized tax provision was $17 million compared with $155 million in the prior year.Reported net income was $197 million compared with $622 million in the prior year. Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.47 compared with $1.45 in the prior year. Normalized net income was $654 million, or $1.57 normalized diluted earnings per share compared with $828 million, or $1.93 normalized diluted earnings per share, in the prior year.Change in Inventory AccountingDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the company elected to change its method of accounting for certain inventory in the U.S. from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in, first out (FIFO) method. The FIFO method of accounting for inventory is more preferable as the company just completed implementation of Project Ovid in the U.S. and this conforms the company's entire inventory to a single method of accounting, thus simplifying its inventory cost accounting method and providing an increased level of consistency in the measurement of the company's inventories. This also improves comparability with the company's peers. The company applied this change in inventory costing method by retrospectively adjusting its historical financial statements. The impact of the change in inventory accounting as reported under the FIFO method compared with the amount if it continued to be reported under the LIFO method was a $4 million increase to cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter 2022 and a $12 million decrease to cost of goods sold for the full year 2022. Amounts in this press release reflect the impact of the accounting change to FIFO.Restructuring and Savings PlanThe company previously announced a restructuring and savings initiative, Project Phoenix, that aims to strengthen the company by leveraging its scale to further reduce complexity, streamlining its operating model and driving operational efficiencies.Project Phoenix is expected to be substantially implemented by the end of 2023. It incorporates a variety of initiatives designed to simplify the organizational structure, streamline the company’s real estate, centralize its supply chain functions, which include manufacturing, distribution, transportation and customer service, transition to a unified One Newell go-to-market model in key international geographies, and otherwise reduce overhead costs.In connection with Project Phoenix the company expects to realize annualized pre-tax savings in the range of $220 million to $250 million when fully implemented, with $140 million to $160 million expected to be realized in 2023. Restructuring and related charges associated with these actions are estimated to be in the range of $100 million to $130 million and are expected to be substantially incurred by the end of 2023. The restructuring plan is expected to result in the elimination of approximately 13 percent of office positions. The company began reducing headcount in the first quarter 2023, with most of these actions expected to be completed by the end of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.New Operating SegmentsAs previously announced, to drive further simplification and unlock additional efficiencies and synergies within the organization, Newell Brands will implement a new operating model, consolidating its five operating segments into three operating segments. The company will combine its previously reported Commercial Solutions, Home Appliances and Home Solutions segments into one operating segment, Home &amp; Commercial Solutions. Learning &amp; Development and Outdoor &amp; Recreation will remain as the company’s other two operating segments. The company will report on this basis commencing January 1, 2023.Outlook for Full Year and First Quarter 2023The company initiated its full year and first quarter outlook for 2023 as follows:Full Year 2023 OutlookNet Sales$8.4 to $8.6 billionCore Sales8% to 6% declineNormalized Operating Margin9.6% to 10.1%Normalized EPS$0.95 to $1.08Q1 2023 OutlookNet Sales$1.79 to $1.84 billionCore Sales18% to 16% declineNormalized Operating Margin3.0% to 3.5%Normalized EPS($0.06) to ($0.03)For full year 2023, the company expects to deliver operating cash flow in the range of $700 million to $900 million, including approximately $95 million to $120 million in cash expenditures associated with Project Phoenix.The company has presented forward-looking statements regarding core sales, normalized operating margin and normalized earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgement and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking normalized operating margin or normalized earnings per share to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, we believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company's future financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures are preliminary estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end and year-end adjustments. Any variation between the company's actual results and preliminary financial data set forth above may be material.Conference CallNewell Brands’ fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call will be held today, February 10, at 8:30 a.m. ET. A link to the webcast is provided under Events &amp; Presentations in the Investors section of the company’s website at www.newellbrands.com. A webcast replay will be made available in the Quarterly Earnings section of the company’s website.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis release contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that are included in this press release and the additional financial information both to explain its results to stockholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures (a) permit investors to view the company’s performance and liquidity using the same tools that management uses to evaluate the company’s past performance, reportable segments, prospects for future performance and liquidity, and (b) determine certain elements of management incentive compensation.The company’s management believes that core sales provides a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales on a consistent basis as it excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, retail store openings and closings, certain market and category exits, and changes in foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. The effect of changes in foreign exchange on reported sales is calculated by applying the prior year average monthly exchange rates to the current year local currency sales amounts (excluding acquisitions and divestitures), with the difference between the 2022 reported sales and constant currency sales presented as the foreign exchange impact increase or decrease in core sales. The company’s management believes that ""normalized"" gross margin, ""normalized"" operating income, ""normalized"" operating margin, ""normalized EBITDA"", ""normalized"" net income, ""normalized"" diluted earnings per share, ""normalized"" interest and ""normalized"" income tax benefit or expense, which exclude restructuring and restructuring-related expenses and one-time and other events such as costs related to the extinguishment of debt, certain tax benefits and charges, impairment charges, pension settlement charges, divestiture costs, costs related to the acquisition, integration and financing of acquired businesses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inflationary adjustments, expenses related to a large customer bankruptcy in Latin America and certain other items, are useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the company’s core ongoing operations and liquidity. ""Normalized EBITDA"" is an ongoing liquidity measure (that excludes non-cash items) and is calculated as normalized earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense.The company determines the tax effect of the items excluded from normalized diluted earnings per share by applying the estimated effective rate for the applicable jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain situations in which an item excluded from normalized results impacts income tax expense, the company utilizes a ""with"" and ""without"" approach to determine normalized income tax benefit or expense.While the company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the company’s performance and liquidity, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.About Newell BrandsNewell Brands (NASDAQ: NWL) is a leading global consumer goods company with a strong portfolio of well-known brands, including Rubbermaid, FoodSaver, Calphalon, Sistema, Sharpie, Paper Mate, Dymo, EXPO, Elmer’s, Yankee Candle, Graco, NUK, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Spontex, Coleman, Campingaz, Contigo, Oster, Sunbeam and Mr. Coffee.

These statements generally can be identified by the use of words or phrases, including, but not limited to, ""guidance,"" ""outlook,"" ""intend,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""target,"" ""plan,"" ""expect,"" ""setting up,"" ""beginning to,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""would,"" ""could,"" ""resume,"" ""are confident that,"" ""remain optimistic that,"" ""seek to,"" or similar statements. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including impairment charges and accounting for income taxes. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:our ability to optimize costs and cash flow and mitigate the impact of retailer inventory rebalancing through discretionary and overhead spend management, advertising and promotion expense optimization, demand forecast and supply plan adjustments and actions to improve working capital;our dependence on the strength of retail and consumer demand and commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various countries around the world;our ability to improve productivity, reduce complexity and streamline operations;our ability to manage the actual or perceived effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any additional variants of the virus or the efficacy and distribution of vaccines;competition with other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products;major retailers’ strong bargaining power and consolidation of our customers;supply chain and operational disruptions in the markets in which we operate, whether as a result of the actual or perceived effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or broader geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine;changes in the prices and availability of labor, transportation, raw materials and sourced products, including significant inflation, and our ability to offset cost increases through pricing and productivity in a timely manner;the cost and outcomes of governmental investigations, inspections, lawsuits, legislative requests or other actions by third parties, the potential outcomes of which could exceed policy limits, to the extent insured;our ability to develop innovative new products, to develop, maintain and strengthen end-user brands and to realize the benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend;our ability to consistently maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;the risks inherent to our foreign operations, including currency fluctuations, exchange controls and pricing restrictions;future events that could adversely affect the value of our assets and/or stock price and require additional impairment charges;unexpected costs or expenses associated with dispositions;our ability to effectively execute our turnaround plan, including Project Ovid and Project Phoenix;risks related to our substantial indebtedness, potential increases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings;a failure or breach of one of our key information technology systems, networks, processes or related controls or those of our service providers;the impact of U.S. and foreign regulations on our operations, including the impact of tariffs and environmental remediation costs and legislation and regulatory actions related to data privacy and climate change;the potential inability to attract, retain and motivate key employees;changes in tax laws and the resolution of tax contingencies resulting in additional tax liabilities;product liability, product recalls or related regulatory actions;our ability to protect intellectual property rights;significant increases in the funding obligations related to our pension plans; andother factors listed from time to time in our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other SEC filings.The consolidated condensed financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Management’s application of U.S. GAAP requires the pervasive use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements. The company continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary and supply chain pressures, and the indirect macroeconomic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has required greater use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we have made our best estimates based upon current information, actual results could materially differ and may require future changes to such estimates and assumptions, including reserves, which may result in future expense.The information contained in this press release and the tables is as of the date indicated. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or developments.NEWELL BRANDS INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)(Amounts in millions, except per share data)Three Months Ended December 31,Twelve Months Ended December 31,20222021% Change20222021% ChangeNet sales$2,285$2,805(18.5)%$9,459$10,589(10.7)%Cost of products sold1,6851,9686,6257,226Gross profit600837(28.3)%2,8343,363(15.7)%Selling, general and administrative expenses544607(10.4)%2,0332,274(10.6)%Restructuring costs, net3—1516Impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets3266047460Operating income (loss)(273)170NM3121,013(69.2)%Non-operating expenses:Interest expense, net6459235256Loss on extinguishment of debt1515Other income, net(8)(5)(81)(8)Income (loss) before income taxes(330)111NM157760(79.3)%Income tax provision (benefit)(81)13(40)138Net income (loss)$(249)$98NM$197$622(68.3)%Weighted average common shares outstanding:Basic413.6425.5415.7425.3Diluted413.6428.3417.4428.0Earnings (loss) per share:Basic$(0.60)$0.23$0.47$1.46Diluted$(0.60)$0.23$0.47$1.45Dividends per share$0.23$0.23$0.92$0.92* NM - NOT MEANINGFULNEWELL BRANDS INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)(Amounts in millions)December 31, 2022December 31, 2021AssetsCurrent assetsCash and cash equivalents$287$440Accounts receivable, net1,2501,500Inventories2,2032,087Prepaid expenses and other current assets312325Total current assets4,0524,352Property, plant and equipment, net1,1841,204Operating lease assets578558Goodwill3,2983,504Other intangible assets, net2,6493,370Deferred income taxes810814Other assets691467TOTAL ASSETS$13,262$14,269Liabilities and stockholders' equityCurrent liabilitiesAccounts payable$1,062$1,680Accrued compensation123270Other accrued liabilities1,2721,364Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt6213Total current liabilities3,0783,317Long-term debt4,7564,883Deferred income taxes520428Operating lease liabilities512500Other noncurrent liabilities877983Total liabilities9,74310,111Total stockholders' equity3,5194,158TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY$13,262$14,269NEWELL BRANDS INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED)(Amounts in millions)Twelve Months Ended December 31,20222021Cash flows from operating activities:Net income$197$622Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities:Depreciation and amortization296325Impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets47460Gain from sale of businesses, net(136)(4)Deferred income taxes97(24)Stock based compensation expense1252Loss on extinguishment of debt15Other, net2(2)Changes in operating accounts excluding the effects of divestitures:Accounts receivable130130Inventories(276)(463)Accounts payable(536)177Accrued liabilities and other(533)6Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities(272)884Cash flows from investing activities:Proceeds from sale of divested business617—Capital expenditures(312)(289)Other investing activities3821Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities343]"

After that come earnings reports from major retailers, who should be able to shed light on how consumer spending is trending.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Michigan consumer sentimentThe preliminary reading for February consumer sentiment is due out from the University of Michigan at 10:00 ET (15:00 GMT). Analysts are expecting it to tick up to 65 from 64.9 in the prior reading.2.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Washington companies and stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, the state of Washington would be the 30th largest country in the world, with a GDP of $677 billion in 2021. This is aided by being home to some of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world, including one of only 4 companies in the world which have a market cap of more than $1 trillion. Home to two of the biggest tech companies in the world, Washington also has some of the highest concentration of STEM workers in the country.25 biggest Washington companies and stocksPixabay/Public DomainSeveral industries are extremely important to Washington's GDP including agriculture/food manufacturing, aerospace, clean technology, information and communication technology, life science, maritime and of course the military/defense sectors. Washington is considered to be a global leader in aircraft and uncrewed aerial systems while the agriculture sector is home to around 300 crop commodities whose markets are continuing to expand growth including eliminating trade barriers, streamlined regulations and more efficient transportation in addition to ensuring that the state's farmlands are protected. Clean technology has been a major focus for the state of Washington and innovation and growth in this sector, which is beneficial for reducing our impact on the planet, and incentives are offered in this respect which we'll come back to later. But of course, the leading sector is information and technology, with the state benefitting from a wealth of talent located there.Currently, the unemployment rate for the state of Washington is 4%, which is higher than the national average and ranks 33rd among all state in the country. This is despite the plethora of jobs created by the biggest Washington companies and stocks. This isn't a recent trend, as historically, the state of Washington's unemployment rate has generally been higher than the national average because of a high share of resource-based industries because of which employment rates fluctuate. This will of course not be helped by the state's biggest company laying off 18,000 people.Story continuesTo encourage businesses, Washington state provides various incentives and as mentioned earlier, there are specific incentives related to renewable energy including sales tax exemptions for qualifying solar equipment from July 2019 to December 2029 while the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System allowing business systems to deduct up to 85% of the cost of solar equipment from their tax liability over a period of 5 years.The biggest Washington companies and stocks have combined revenues of well over $1 trillion while the combined market cap is close to $3.5 trillion, though a large majority of both of these numbers is derived from just the top 4 companies. For our ranking, we first selected all Washington  companies included in Fortune 500 while scouring the internet for more top companies for which financial data is available, regardless of whether they're listed or not. Their revenue was determined either from Fortune 500, Yahoo Finance, annual reports or press releases while market cap was confirmed form Yahoo Finance, with 60% weightage assigned to revenue and 40% to market cap. For companies which aren't listed, ranking is based on revenue alone. So, let's now take a look at Washington's top companies, starting with:25.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) shareholders have seen the share price rise 74% over three years, well in excess of the market return (19%, not including dividends).In light of the stock dropping 3.6% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive three-year return. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, United Parcel Service achieved compound earnings per share growth of 37% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 20% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that United Parcel Service has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling United Parcel Service stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of United Parcel Service, it has a TSR of 90% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that United Parcel Service shareholders are down 11% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 8.4%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 15%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand United Parcel Service better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - United Parcel Service has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.But note: United Parcel Service may not be the best stock to buy.

380,57690441-0d16-3650-99ce-89ab62db520d,AXP,2023-02-10,American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 65% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-company-nyse-axp-110123157.html,1676026883,STORY,['AXP'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about American Express. Check out our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in American Express. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of American Express, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. American Express is not owned by hedge funds. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 20% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.3% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.0% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that American Express Company insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$191m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in American Express. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 20% of the American Express shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

CardMapr nl / UnsplashMicrosoft’s artificial intelligence technology, recently supercharged by ChatGPT, is applied to a range of fields, from scientific research to product design.It’s also being applied to one of the most tedious jobs on the planet, expense filing, as American Express and Navan (formerly TripActions) begin adopting the technology to enhance payments.American Express on Thursday revealed it is partnering with Microsoft to develop a new solution to “simplify expense reporting for employees and businesses, using artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.”It will feature a “decision engine” that categorizes transactions and assigns risk scores based on transaction details, the company’s travel and expense policy, and the traveler’s purchase and payment history on their American Express card.“Imagine a future where the majority of your expenses are simply auto-submitted and auto-approved, requiring no manual intervention,” said said Gunther Bright, executive vice president, global commercial services at American Express.Unlike most expense platforms, this new iteration can sit on top of other expense systems. American Express will first pilot it on Microsoft’s employees by integrating it into the tech company’s internal expense system. Then it wants to offer it to its other corporate clients, allowing them to overlay it on their existing expense management tools.American Express is also part-owner of American Express Global Business Travel, which offers the neo and neo1 spend management platforms. The spokesperson said there was no impact on Amex GBT’s own offerings.The push to make expenses easier and more accurate by automating them makes sense. Companies process an average of 51,000 expense reports each year, and on average spend half a million dollars and 3,000 hours correcting errors annually, according to the Global Business Travel Association.And one in five business travelers would rather pour lemon juice on a cut than file an expense report, a survey from software company Banyan recently found. A third are willing to pay someone $50 to do an expense report for them.Story continuesAs a result, travel agencies are continually looking to evolve.ChatGPT, AgainWhile American Express is working with Microsoft, which has invested in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, a spokesperson told Skift it is open and equipped to adopt any technology that will add value to the tool, but it has not specifically explored OpenAI so far.However travel and expense management company Navan this week said it has integrated the so-called generative artificial intelligence as part of its rebrand. It claims it is the first travel company to do so.“When a traveler leaves a hotel, they no longer need to wait at the desk for an itemized folio,” said a spokeperson. Leveraging artificial intelligence, its app can automatically retrieve the hotel folio, read line items, categorize them, and then check against company policy, before submitting the receipt.It also launched a virtual assistant called Ava, which can order corporate cards or suggest restaurant recommendations.“In just two years, the leading players in travel and expense will be either established companies that have already embraced ChatGPT or new startups that bring innovative experiences and capabilities to the market,” said Ilan Twig, co-founder and chief technology officer.Travel management company BCD Travel on Thursday also announced its own expense revamp by offering a new “data set” to customers. It combines trip information with the financial details of the ticket transaction, fare and tax breakdown. The idea is that it can help pre-populate expense reports with trip and invoice data to save travelers time, increasing accuracy and creating reliable spend insights for finance teams.“Our invoice collection is an example of a targeted data set that, in this case, helps us collectively mitigate some of the challenges of travel and expense spend management for customers,” said Yannis Karmis, senior vice president of product planning and development at BCD Travel.Reading Between the LinesBut as ChatGPT continues to make headlines, is there a risk travel companies are simply cashing in on the buzz? How can clients know whether it’s actually effective, or just marketing spin?“The challenge with generative AI is that it’s only as smart as the average omniscient human: sure it might know everything, but that’s quickly becoming the easy part. Doing something for you is the hard part,” said David Barrett, CEO of Expensify.He said his platform’s concierge AI has been doing expenses, scanning receipts, booking travel, and managing accounting for years. “It’s true we don’t write poetry on demand, but we think that businesses have more important functions, and we’re the only ones who do those,” he added. “ChatGPT is clearly amazing in many respects and we’re tracking it closely.”SAP Concur, probably the most widely used expense platform, has also long used artificial intelligence to streamline spend processes for businesses and employees. Its Verify audit service is one example within Concur Expense, as it automatically checks expense reports to identify potential misuse.“Verify is built on an analysis of more than a trillion dollars in spend and tens of millions of expenses and receipts within the SAP Concur platform. It uses artificial intelligence  and machine learning to tap decades of expense data and experience tracking to identify hard-to-detect spend issues and anomalies,” said Charlie Sultan, president of Concur Travel.A spokesperson for Navan said the company has also leveraged artificial intelligence since its inception in 2015 to optimize efficiencies, both internally and for its customers. “Integrating ChatGPT was a natural next step,” they said.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

The first solution developed through this collaboration will enhance the expense management process by addressing some of the pain points business travelers and expense processors face.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230209005039/en/(Photo: Business Wire)Using AI and machine learning capabilities, the solution will bolster clients’ existing processes and tools by simplifying and automating manual expense reporting and approvals, enhancing audit efficacy, and streamlining reconciliation and reimbursements for accounting teams. Microsoft will pilot the solution with its employees, by integrating it into the company’s internal expense system later this year. The solution will be made available to other American Express Corporate clients over time, with the ability to integrate into other expense management tools.This is how the solution will work: When a business traveler swipes their American Express Corporate Card, they’ll be prompted to upload a picture of their receipt. An AI-powered decision engine then categorizes the transaction and assigns a risk score based on transaction details, the company’s travel and expense (T&amp;E) policy, and the traveler’s purchase and payment history on their American Express Corporate Card. The risk score is coded as green (recommended for auto-approval), yellow (needs another look), or red (not recommended for approval) depending on factors like company expense policy, consistency with existing spend patterns, indications of fraud, and more. The information is then passed to an expense management system, along with receipt details to auto-generate reports and help managers and auditors in their decision making. Through machine learning the solution will get smarter over time, adapting its algorithms based on patterns and gradually increasing its ability to maximize expense auto-approval with lower error rates and escalations.Story continues""Expense reports are a necessity, but we all hate doing them. At the same time, every company has an increased need for control and compliance with expenses. Now imagine a future where the majority of your expenses are simply ‘auto-submitted’ and ‘auto-approved,’ requiring no manual intervention and adhering to your companies’ policies and spend limits. By combining our customer insights and data, purposeful technology innovation, and a collaboration with an industry leader like Microsoft, we are creating a solution that addresses these needs with a seamless experience for the employee,"" said Gunther Bright, Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Services at American Express.""Advanced technologies like Microsoft Azure AI and machine learning provide powerful, new opportunities to reimagine pervasive, time-consuming manual processes,"" said Bill Borden, Corporate Vice President, Worldwide Financial Services at Microsoft. ""We look forward to collaborating with American Express to simplify expense management and deliver intelligent digital capabilities to improve the lives of business travelers and employees.""Expense Management Sentiment Revealed in New American Express Trendex SurveyAccording to a new American Express Expense Management Trendex survey¹, which polled business travelers and travel expense processors, the expense management process is a major pain point today that needs to be updated.Four-in-ten business travelers say they would rather have a performance review (41%), weekly meetings on Monday at 8 a.m. (40%), their flight delayed by an hour (40%), or a full day of virtual meetings (40%) than have to complete their expense reports. Additionally, 59% of travel expense processors, who don’t currently have a completely autonomous expense report management system, say the greatest benefit to having a more automated expense report management system would be saving time, and 94% of all travel expense processors agree there needs to be more innovation, signaling the need for more automated solutions.Other key findings from the Trendex include:The majority (73%) of business travelers agree that business travel would be less stressful if managing expenses was less of a hassle.More than half (52%) of business travelers and over one-third (35%) of travel expense processors report a negative reaction when describing their employer’s current expense management process.Business travelers say their most common (54%) pain point associated with expense reports is the gathering and keeping track of receipts.The most common pain points for travel expense processors are employees missing submission deadlines (50%) and ensuring expenses comply with company travel policy (49%).60% of business travelers agree their least favorite part of business travel is completing/ turning in their expenses.Most business travelers (76%) spend at least 30 minutes on their monthly travel expense reports and, on average, two-thirds (65%) of travel expense processors take at least one hour to review one monthly expense report, signaling the need for efficient time management solutions.Among the travel expense processors who don’t currently have completely automated expense report management systems, nearly all (95%) wish they did.The new solution is part of American Express’ ongoing work to redefine the end-to-end payments experience globally, both for travelers and companies.

Although revenues were on recovering trend during 2022 on the back of normalizing of economies, the macro headwinds hurt margins.The Zacks Medical – Products industry bore the brunt along with broader market participants. New product launches and expansion into new territories are likely to drive revenues going forward. A strong demand trend in certain medical procedures related to pacing, cardiac surgery, neurovascular and diabetes are encouraging.However, the weaknesses in the industry’s bottom line is likely to continue in the first half of 2023. The impact of rising cost is likely to come down as we proceed down the year. The industry participants are gradually raising prices of product and services along with cost-cutting initiatives to offset inflationary pressure.The European and international markets are also showing signs of a steady recovery in demand for medical products. Meanwhile, COVID-19 impacts remain uncertain.

Also, favorable inflation data has been helping investors regain the lost confidence as they now feel that the economy may have a soft landing in 2023 and a recession might be avoided.Easing inflation has also made the Fed go slow on its aggressive interest rate hike policy. The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points on Feb 1 to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%. This marks the highest interest rate since 2007.Alongside the interest rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell also said that the central bank finally thinks for the first time that the “deflationary process” has started. The Fed started going slow on its rate hikes in December when it increased interest rates by 50 basis points after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes.The decision to go slow on rate hikes is definitely a good sign but the crisis is far from over, given that inflation is still at multi-year highs.Also, on Feb 8, several Fed officials went on record saying that more interest rate hikes can be expected in 2023 as its fight to cool inflation continues. New York Fed President John Williams called a federal funds rate of something between 5.00% and 5.25% would be a “reasonable view” of what the central bank could do this year to further ease inflation. Thus, as indicated by Powell, there are few chances of rate cuts in 2023.Given this situation, an astute investor should decide to keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks right now. This is because dividend stocks with a proven track record and a solid business plan can withstand market turbulence.In addition to ensuring a constant flow of income, they minimize the likelihood of price swings.

Westrock Coffee Company, LLC roasts, produces, and distributes coffee. The US$952m market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of US$46m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$56m leading to an even wider gap between loss and breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Westrock Coffee Company will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. View our latest analysis for Westrock Coffee Company Consensus from 4 of the American Food analysts is that Westrock Coffee Company is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2022, before generating positive profits of US$16m in 2023. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 12 months from now or less. We calculated the rate at which the company must grow to meet the consensus forecasts predicting breakeven within 12 months. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 106% is expected, which is rather optimistic! If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Westrock Coffee Company given that this is a high-level summary, though, bear in mind that generally a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.Before we wrap up, there’s one issue worth mentioning.

Good evening all and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to have closed out a strong 2022 with full year global CF product revenue up 18% versus 2021. Our full year 2023 product revenue guidance is $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing 7% to 9% growth year-on-year inclusive of FX headwind of approximately 1.5%. We have more than 20,000 patients still to reach with CFTR modulators and we continue to work with focus and urgency to reach all patients with CF around the globe who may benefit from our therapies. It is an exciting time for Vertex. Our medicines have transformed CF and the growth of our CF business has transformed Vertex. Our differentiated R&amp;D approach led to our multiple life-changing therapies in cystic fibrosis and is designed to deliver transformative medicines for serious diseases at high rates of success.Story continuesAgnostic to modality, it is delivering just that. In aggregate, our mid and late-stage clinical pipeline holds the promise to deliver potentially transformative benefit for patients across eight disease areas. As detailed on Slide 5, each program holds the potential to be best-in-class and transform the disease and each represents a multi-billion dollar market opportunity. Furthermore, we see the opportunity to launch new products into five of these disease areas within the next five years or our five and five goal and we're not done. The next wave of innovation is also making progress and advancing through preclinical development, including programs in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy Type 1. This breadth of pipeline success, accelerated pace of clinical trial progress and build out of commercial capabilities for upcoming product launches warrant continued investments in 2023.As such, we are strategically investing and focusing on execution to drive forward the significant opportunity with a uniquely strong and durable CF franchise, a deep, broad and advancing R&amp;D pipeline with multiple potentially near-term commercial opportunities, a strong balance sheet and a deeply talented and committed team, Vertex is well positioned to deliver for patients and shareholders for years to come. With that overview, I'll turn to the details of recent R&amp;D progress. Starting with CF. We'll continue our journey in cystic fibrosis as we serially innovate to bring highly efficacious therapies to all CF patients. Our next in class vanzacaftor triple combination completed enrollment in its two Phase 3 clinical trials, SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103 in patients ages 12 years and older in Q4 of 2022.While TRIKAFTA sets a very high bar, our enthusiasm for this vanzacaftor program is also high. This program could deliver even greater benefits to patients given one, our highly predictive, in vitro human bronchial epithelial or HPE cell assays showed the vanza triple was superior to TRIKAFTA in improving chloride transport, a direct measure of CFTR function. Two, our Phase 2 clinical data also suggest the potential for greater efficacy for vanzacaftor versus TRIKAFTA. And three, the vanzacaftor triple also has the benefit of once-daily oral dosing and a substantially reduced royalty burden relative to TRIKAFTA. The Phase 3 trial are currently in the 52 week dosing period and we anticipate their completion towards the end of this year. Another important program is the VX-522 program, our CFTR mRNA approach that we are developing in partnership with Moderna for CF patients who cannot benefit from our CFTR modulators.In December of 2022, the FDA cleared the IND for VX-522 and the single ascending dose study in CF patients was initiated last year, a major milestone for Vertex and the field. We have high expectations given over five years of research that led to the discovery of VX-522 with the following properties, one, delivery of mRNA at high efficiency into HBE cells; two, expression of CFTR protein leading to high levels of chloride transport; and three, in both rodents and non-human primates expression of CFTR protein in the desired cells; and lastly, a preclinical safety profile that supported advancement into human clinical trials. We are excited with the progress of VX-522, which brings hope to the more than 5,000 CF patients who are still waiting for a treatment that targets the underlying cause of their disease.Turning now to exa-cel, our gene-editing program for severe sickle cell disease and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. This is our most advanced program outside of CF and we expect exa-cel to be our next commercial launch. In late Q4, we completed our regulatory submissions for exa-cel for both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia in the EU and UK. Both the EMA and the MHRA have recently validated the MAA submissions. And in the U.S., we remain on track to complete our rolling BLA submission by the end of this quarter. The remarkable clinical benefits are evident in the data we've shared to date. Exa-cel holds the promise to be the first CRISPR-based gene-editing treatment to be approved and represents a near-term and significant market opportunity, which Stuart will detail.Turning next to VX-548 and our pain program. VX-548 is our novel selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that holds a promise of highly effective pain relief without the side effects or addictive potential of opioids. If approved, VX-548 would represent the first new class of pain medicine in decades with the potential to address the staggeringly high unmet need in acute pain. VX-548 acts on the peripheral nerves to block the pain signal and thus may be able to provide effective pain relief without the abuse potential, which is a central nervous system phenomenon. We have high expectations for this program because NaV1.8 is a genetically and pharmacologically validated target. Second, we have multiple positive proof of concept results with VX-150, a predecessor molecule to VX-548 and proof of concept with VX-548 itself.And lastly, our Phase 3 program in acute pain is substantially similar to the positive Phase 2 trials we have already conducted. VX-548 has been granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation in the U.S. We initiated pivotal development last year and we are enrolling patients across three Phase 3 studies with the goal of seeking a broad moderate to severe acute pain label. We anticipate completing the Phase 3 pivotal program towards the end of this year or the beginning of next, creating another potentially significant and near-term commercial opportunity, which Stuart will also discuss. In addition to validation of NaV1.8 as a target in acute pain, it has also been validated as a target in neuropathic pain. I am pleased to share that in late Q4, we initiated a 12-week Phase 2 dose ranging proof of concept study for VX-548 in peripheral neuropathic pain.We look forward to updating you as this Phase 2 program progresses and to sharing more on the market opportunity on future calls. Transitioning now to inaxaplin or VX-147, the first potential medicine to target the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD, post the positive Phase 2 proof of concept study, inaxaplin is now being studied in a single adaptive Phase 2/3 pivotal trial. This study has a pre-planned interim analysis at 48 weeks of treatment, which if positive could serve as the basis to seek accelerated approval in the U.S. Our goal is to complete the Phase 2 dose ranging portion of the Phase 2/3 pivotal study this year, select a dose, and then continue on to the Phase 3 portion. We are also working to increase awareness screening and diagnosis through multiple initiatives given the high unmet need and the approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe alone.With inaxaplin, we see the potential of bringing a first-in-class treatment to patients with AMKD and unlocking a multi-billion dollar market opportunity. Moving to type 1 diabetes where a goal is to deliver a transformative if not curative therapy for the more than 2.5 million patients with type 1 diabetes in North America and Europe. We are advancing multiple programs. First, VX-880 is our stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cells, which use standard immunosuppressive to protect the cells from the immune system. These cells are also foundational for the other two T1D programs. For VX-880, we achieved proof-of-concept last year with the first two patients treated in Part A of the VX-880 study. We have now fully enrolled Part B, where patients will receive the target dose on a staggered basis.The next phase is Part C, expected to initiate later this year in which patients will be treated concurrently with the target dose. We look forward to sharing VX-880 data from more patients and with longer duration of follow up at medical congresses this year. Second VX-264 or the cells plus device, which encapsulates the same fully differentiated insulin producing islet cells in a proprietary device that shields the cells from the body's immune system and hence there is no requirement for immunosuppressants. In late Q4, we simultaneously filed a CTA in Canada as well as the IND in the U.S. As we shared last month, the CTA has cleared and we look forward to initiating enrollment and dosing of patients in Canada in the coming months. In the U.S., the IND has not cleared.We have received and responded to the FDA's questions. We look forward to working with the agency with urgency, so that we can initiate the study in the U.S. as soon as possible. Third, in our hypoimmune program, we are editing the same fully differentiated insulin producing islets to cloak them from the immune system, another path to obviating the need for immunosuppressive. This program continues to progress in preclinical development. Let me close the T1D section with an update on the ViaCyte acquisition through which we gained intellectual property, tools and capabilities that hold the potential to accelerate our goal of developing transformative treatments for this disease. We have now completed our data and portfolio review and are very pleased with the progress to date.We have begun executing our integration plans. On the clinical side, a Phase 1/2 study of VCTX-211, a hypoimmune cell program that originated with ViaCyte and that Vertex is now developing in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics has been initiated and is ongoing. All other ViaCyte clinical trials have completed enrollment and dosing and are in the follow-up stage. I'll finish up with the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or AATD program. Both a Phase 1 study of VX-634, the first in a series of next wave AAT correctors and a 48-week Phase 2 study of VX-864, our first generation AAT corrector are ongoing. We look forward to updating you as these programs advance. I'll now ask Stuart to review our commercial progress.Stuart Arbuckle: Thanks, Reshma. Today, I will review our continued strong performance and outlook in CF as well as potential near-term commercial launches in new disease areas with exa-cel and VX-548. Starting with CF, where we continue to bring our transformative medicines to many more patients globally. Last month, we raised our estimate for the number of patients with cystic fibrosis in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Canada to 88,000 up from our previous estimate of 83,000. The growth in the CF population can be attributed to more patients coming forward to receive treatment, better data capture in patient registries, and perhaps most importantly, people with CF are living longer due to improvements in patient care and the availability of truly effective therapies.Medicine, Health, PharmacyPhoto by Julia Zolotova on UnsplashFor a baby born with CF in 2021, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation predicts the median age of survival is now 65 years. In the U.S., our focus remains on maintaining the very high persistence and compliance rates we have seen with our therapies and extending the benefits into younger age groups. Outside the U.S., uptake of KAFTRIO/TRIKAFTA in countries with recent reimbursement agreements continues to drive growth, as has the rollout of KAFTRIO in children ages six to 11 years in countries where this indication has recently received reimbursed access such as France and Spain. There are still more than 20,000 CF patients who could benefit from, but are not on CFTR modulator treatment. These patients fall primarily into two categories. One, patients in countries where we are early on the launch curve, and two, younger patients for whom we continue to pursue additional label and reimbursement extensions, such as the recent U.S. approval of ORKAMBI for ages one to two years and recent regulatory submissions for KALYDECO in children ages one to four months, and for TRIKAFTA in ages two to five years, which has received Priority Review and a PDUFA date of April 28 in the U.S. We are confident that we will reach the vast majority of these patients over time, which will continue to drive revenue growth in the near and long-term.We also see exciting growth potential for our vanzacaftor triple combo given the anticipated clinical profile, more convenient once daily dosing, and the potential to offer a new option for patients who have discontinued prior CFTR modulator therapy. Finally, in CF, as Reshma mentioned, our CFTR mRNA program VX-522 is being developed for the more than 5,000 CF patients worldwide who currently do not have any therapies that treat the underlying cause of their disease. I will now detail our commercial readiness efforts and the market opportunity for two potential product launches outside of CF, exa-cel and VX-548. Exa-cel holds curative potential for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, and we are making significant progress with launch preparation activities.Our initial launch of exa-cel will focus on the approximately 32,000 individuals in the U.S. and Europe for whom these diseases are most severe, presenting a significant clinical, humanistic and economic burden. The estimated 25,000 severe sickle cell disease patients have multiple hospitalizations annually for vaso-occlusive crisis, while the estimated 7,000 TDT patients undergo near monthly transfusions. There is also a considerable financial burden both for these patients and to the healthcare system. In the U.S. economic models project the lifetime treatment costs for severe sickle cell disease patients to be between $4 million and $6 million. Recent market research indicates that physicians have a strong preference and interest in gene editing over other potentially curative approaches.And that patients with sickle cell disease are increasingly optimistic about the potential role for curative therapies in the treatment of their disease. In addition, payors view the emerging clinical data for exa-cel as highly impactful, most notably the reductions in vaso-occlusive crisis and hospitalizations. Importantly for our specialty commercial model, these 32,000 severe patients are concentrated geographically and we believe can be served effectively with a network of approximately 50 authorized treatment centers or ATCs in the U.S. and approximately 25 in Europe. We have established the needed supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure to support the launch, including validated chain of identity and chain of custody systems, global shipping infrastructure, and the needed manufacturing capacity to support uptake following approval.And finally, we continue to work with key commercial and government payors and policy makers in the U.S. and Europe to ensure they understand the significant burden of these diseases and that broad patient access and reimbursement are in place if and when exa-cel is approved. To date, we have engaged with all U.S. state Medicaid agencies, some 150 unique U.S. commercial payors, as well as multiple health technology assessment bodies in Europe, including NICE and GBA, to share important information about exa-cel and our commitment to working collaboratively to provide access to this therapy. Shifting now to VX-548, which we believe has the potential to play an important role across the pain spectrum, including acute pain and chronic pain conditions.I'll focus my comments on acute pain, which is a near-term commercial opportunity. There are four aspects critical to framing the acute pain opportunity for Vertex. One, there is a significant unmet need due to the limitations and drawbacks of currently available treatments. Two, the market is large today, even with 90% generic prescribing. Three, prescribing is concentrated in the hospital setting and thus addressable with a specialty commercial infrastructure. And four, there is broad stakeholder recognition of the need for new therapies, which also helps provide a clear path to future patient access and reimbursement. Firstly, millions in the U.S. suffer from acute pain each year, yet it is often difficult to manage effectively given the limitations of existing therapies.The current standards of care are NSAIDs and acetaminophen at one end of the spectrum, which are non-addicting, but offer limited pain relief and can pose GI and liver toxicity concerns. And at the other end of the spectrum are opioids, which provide effective pain relief, but have many undesirable side effects, including nausea and somnolence and have significant abuse potential. Many large hospital systems and all 50 states have adopted restrictions for the use of opioids. This leaves a vast gap in the treatment landscape for a medicine like VX-548 with strong efficacy, a desirable benefit risk profile, and without abuse potential given it is peripherally acting. Second, the acute pain market is very large valued in the U.S. at $4 billion, despite 90% of prescriptions being generic.Third, this highly concentrated market can be served with a specialty commercial model. Of the 1.5 billion treatment days for acute pain annually, some two-thirds or 1 billion are driven by hospital prescribing, following inpatient or outpatient procedures such as surgeries or emergency room visits. Furthermore, these hospital-driven prescriptions are concentrated among approximately 1,700 hospitals that aggregate to roughly 220 integrated delivery networks. Thus, we believe we can reach a large proportion of this market with a specialty sales and marketing infrastructure and have begun to hire for key positions. Fourth, and finally, given the wide stakeholder recognition of the limitations of current treatments and the unmet need, we see both high demand and a clear path to access and reimbursement for a medicine with a profile like VX-548.A key example of the path to reimbursement and access is the recently passed NOPAIN or Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act signed into law last December. Through the NOPAIN Act, Congress has directed CMS to make a separate add-on payment to hospitals in the outpatient and ambulatory surgery center setting for non-opioids for the treatment of pain. We believe this new law is an important sign of the growing movement to remove barriers for hospitals, providers and patients to utilize non-opioid treatment options. In closing, we are excited about the opportunity to extend the benefits of our CF medicines to more patients around the globe and the near-term potential to commercialize transformative treatments for patients with sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia and acute pain.I will now turn the call to Charlie to review the financials.Charlie Wagner: Thanks, Stuart. Vertex's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results represent another year of strong execution and exceptional financial performance. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased 11% year-over-year to 2.3 billion. Growth was led by a 24% year-over-year increase outside the U.S. on continued strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in markets with recently achieved reimbursement as well as label extensions into younger age groups. U.S. CF revenue grew 5% year-over-year with ongoing consistent performance. Full year 2022 revenue of 8.93 billion represents 18% growth versus 2021, marking Vertex's eighth consecutive year of at least double digit revenue growth. Full year 2022 international revenue of 3.23 billion, increased 41%.And full year U.S. revenue of 5.7 billion, increased 8% compared to 2021. For the full year 2022, we estimate the changes in foreign exchange negatively impacted our global revenue growth rate by approximately 1.5 percentage points inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program. Fourth quarter 2022, combined non-GAAP R&amp;D acquired IP R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses were 872 million, an increase of 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Full year 2022 combined non-GAAP R&amp;D, acquired IP R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses were 3.07 billion, a decrease of 11% versus the prior year. Recall that 2021 results were impacted by 1.1 billion of acquired IP R&amp;D charges, including the one time $900 million payment to CRISPR compared to 116 million of such charges in 2022.Acquired IP R&amp;D aside throughout 2022, we continued to invest in research and our advancing pipeline, which includes mid and late stage clinical assets across eight different disease areas. The year-over-year increase in spending reflects stepped up investments in programs where we made notable clinical progress, particularly in pain, the new vanza triple as well as type 1 diabetes. We also continued to invest in the pre-commercial buildout activities for exa-cel and preparation for other potential near-term launches. Given these programs potentially transformative benefit to patients and multi-billion dollar market opportunities, we will continue to invest accordingly. Fourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP operating margin was 50% and we generated non-GAAP operating income of 1.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of 15% versus the prior year period.Full year 2022 non-GAAP operating margin was 54% and full year non-GAAP operating income was 4.79 billion, up 48% versus 2021. We ended the quarter with 10.8 billion in cash in investments as our cash flow generation and balance sheet remained very strong. On the business development front in Q4, we announced a global collaboration with Entrada Therapeutics focused on therapeutics for DM1. The HSR period expired last night and the transaction is expected to close within days. As a result, our Q1 2023 results are anticipated to include an approximate 224 million upfront payment recorded in our income statement and an approximate 26 million equity investment recorded on the balance sheet. Now switching to guidance. We are establishing 2023 product revenue guidance of 9.55 billion to 9.7 billion, representing 7% to 9% year-over-year growth at current exchange rates.Note that this guidance includes an expected approximate 1.5 percentage point headwind to our revenue growth inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program. Also note that 2023 product revenue guidance reflects revenue from cystic fibrosis products only. Exa-cel is not included in guidance as potential approval and launch dates in the EU, UK and U.S. are still to be determined. For our CF franchise in 2023, we see continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in all major markets, further uptake in markets with recent reimbursement agreements and expansion into younger patient populations. Of note, with four years of TRIKAFTA experience, the majority of international reimbursement agreements secured and recent revisions in epidemiology, we have strong visibility to our 2023 revenue guidance range and another year of attractive growth for our CF product portfolio.We are also providing 2023 guidance for combined non-GAAP R&amp;D, acquired IP R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses in a range of 3.9 to 4 billion, which includes approximately 300 million of upfronts and milestones from known collaborations, including the expected upfront payment in Q1 2023 for Entrada. This targeted investment increase is consistent with the significant continued progress of our multiple mid and late stage clinical development programs and the expansion of our commercial and manufacturing capabilities in anticipation of the multi-billion dollar market opportunities represented by our programs with near-term launch potential. Our guidance for projected full year 2023 non-GAAP effective tax rate is a range of 21% to 22%. Lastly, we announced today a new $3 billion multi-year share repurchase authorization.In closing, Vertex performed exceptionally well in 2022. We grew revenue double digits for the eighth consecutive year, maintained our strong balance sheet, invested internally and externally and accelerated programs across our diverse pipeline. In 2023, we look forward to further important milestones as highlighted on this slide to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas. We look forward to updating you on future calls, and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&amp;A period.See also Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield and 25 Most Viewed YouTube Videos of All Time.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Last November, CRSP and VRTX initiated a rolling biologics licensing application (BLA) submission seeking approval for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications. Vertex Pharmaceuticals expects to complete the submission by the end of first-quarter 2023.A regulatory submission for exa-cel in both SCD and TDT indications has already been validated in Europe.CRISPR and Vertex are also evaluating exa-cel in pediatric patients with TDT and SCD in two separate phase III studies.CRISPR Therapeutics is also developing two gene-edited allogeneic cell therapy programs, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) candidates, CTX110 and CTX130, for hematological and solid tumor cancers.Story continuesLast December, management announced data from the phase I CARBON study, which evaluated CTX110 in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. Data from the study showed the benefits of consolidation dosing with CTX110, including a further improvement in the efficacy profile in study participants. Based on these results, management started a phase II study evaluating the consolidation regimen of CTX110.CTX130 is being evaluated in two ongoing independent early-stage studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of several dose levels of the candidate in adults with solid tumors such as renal cell carcinoma (COBALT-RCC study) and certain T-cell and B-cell hematologic malignancies (COBALT-LYM study).CRISPR is also advancing several next-generation CAR-T product candidates, namely — CTX112 targeting CD19 antigen and CTX131 targeting CD70 antigen. These candidates have been designed to enhance CAR-T potency. An early-stage study on CTX112 is expected to start in first-half 2023.Activities related to the development of pipeline candidates are likely to have escalated operating expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CRISPR Therapeutics this time around.

In the distance rises a colossal column of dark smoke set against a blue sky. A dark cloud rises over East Palestine, Ohio.On Feb. 6, an apocalyptic plume of gas rose over the village of East Palestine, Ohio, blotting out the sky. Norfolk Southern, the US railway company responsible for the toxic spew of vinyl chloride, has now offered a $25,000 donation to assist the area’s nearly 5,000 residents who were ordered to evacuate their homes, or face death.“We have established a Family Assistance Center to address the needs of the community and support those directly impacted,” Norfolk Southern said in a statement. It remains unclear what exactly the center is doing to assist displaced residents. Quartz has reached out for a comment.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureFollowing its fiery derailment on Feb. 3, a Norfolk Southern tanker train carried out a “controlled release” of the hazardous vinyl chloride stored aboard to avoid a potential explosion.The derailment was reportedly due to a mechanical problem, but some are blaming the incident on weak safety regulations and the company’s cost-cutting measures.Regulation pushback, cuts in headcountNorfolk Southern has a history of lobbying against safety regulations. The publicly traded company, which has a market value of $55 billion, fought the Federal Railroad Administration’s push to upgrade the “Civil War era” brake system that remains widely used in American trains, and against stricter rules on the transport of hazardous materials. (Meanwhile, its employees still lack guaranteed sick leave.)Safety concerns have also grown amid Norfolk Southern’s implementation of “precision scheduled railroading,” an operations policy criticized as a corporate money grab. To cut costs, the company has slashed jobs by more than a fifth since 2017, ignoring concerns that understaffing could impact railway safety, while also initiating a $10 billion stock buyback program.Millions of dollars in corporate lobbying and poor regulations have created the perfect storm, according to Railroad Workers United (RWU), a cross-union rail workers’ caucus.Story continues“The wreck of Train 32N has been years in the making. What other such train wrecks await us remains to be seen,” RWU said in a press release.Is East Palestine, Ohio safe?The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation into the train derailment, while a federal lawsuit seeking class-action status has been filed by several East Palestine residents.Government officials told evacuated residents of the Ohio-Pennsylvania area on Feb. 8 that they could safely return to their homes, based on air quality samples. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has also declared the area’s drinking water is safe.But concerns remain. Residents have found dead fish in a local stream called Leslie Run, and dead chickens were found in the neighboring town of North Lima, Ohio. Kurt Rhoads, an environmental engineer and associate professor at Ohio’s Case Western Reserve University, told Cleveland 19 News that the impact from the derailment would be felt for years to come.One community in New Jersey can attest to that fact. In 2012, a train crashed in Paulsboro, spilling 23,000 gallons of vinyl chloride, the same chemical involved in the East Palestine spill. A 2014 study conducted by the New Jersey Department of Health found that half of local residents had health problems caused by the chemical spill.What are the health risks from vinyl chloride?When burned, vinyl chloride produces hydrogen chloride, a highly volatile substance that can bind with water vapor to produce hydrochloric acid. It can also produce phosgene, a toxic gas that was deployed as a chemical weapon in World War I.Aside from its toxic byproducts, the odorless and hazardous gas not only lingers in the air, but also can leach into soil and groundwater (pdf). According to the CDC’s toxicological profile, vinyl chloride is linked to liver and neurological damage (pdf) as well as several types of cancer.OSHA guidelines state that no employee should be exposed to the substance at concentrations higher than 1 part per million averaged over an eight-hour period.More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

411,b8907fcc-9490-3f26-a02c-597606c4c8cf,KO,2023-02-10,Buy Coca-Cola Stock Before Earnings After Pepsi's Solid Q4 Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-coca-cola-stock-earnings-003512417.html,1675989312,STORY,"['KO', 'PEP']","[PepsiCo (PEP) shares spiked Thursday after its solid fourth-quarter results also came with the announcement that it will raise its dividend and increase its share repurchase plan.Investors may be wondering if a similar scenario could be in store for Coca-Cola (KO) and if it’s time to buy KO stock before the company’s Q4 report on Tuesday, February 14.Let’s take a look at Coca-Cola stock following Pepsi’s Q4 report to see if it might be worth buying.Brief OverviewCoca-Cola and Pepsi’s business operations are a bit different. Both companies’ core business models revolve around beverage production and distribution, Pepsi also includes food and snack production.This largely reflects the price difference between the two stocks as shown in the chart below and why Pepsi’s earnings and revenue are significantly higher than Coca-Cola. With that being said, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi are viable consumer staples investments, and monitoring their growth and valuation mostly differentiates which company may be more suitable in investors’ portfolios.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsi Q4 ReviewThere could be increased optimism about Coca-Cola stock prior to earnings, largely due to Pepsi’s Q4 report that saw the company beat on its top and bottom line. Pepsi posted quarterly EPS of $1.67 a share topping estimates by 1.82%. Sales came in at $28 billion, which was a 4% surprise.Year over year, Q4 earnings were up 9% with sales up 11% from the prior-year quarter. This was despite Pepsi seeing lower sales volume, contrary to net sales increasing. Specifically, among Pepsi’s Quaker Foods North America, sales volume fell 7%.Pepsi’s net income was also down to $518 million compared to $1.32 billion in Q4 2021. Still, the company did see stronger demand for Pepsi Zero Sugar, with sales volume up 26% as the product looks to rival Coke Zero.Coca-Cola Q4 Preview Looking at Coca-Cola, Q4 earnings are projected at $0.45 per share, which would be on par with Q4 2021. Sales for the quarter are expected to be $10.01 billion, up 6% from the prior year quarter. Story continuesThis would round out Coca-Cola’s Fiscal 2022 with earnings up 7% to $2.48 a share. On the top line, sales would be up 11% for FY22 to $42.86 billion compared to $38.66 billion in 2021.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; Outlook  After wrapping up fiscal 2022, Coca-Cola’s FY23 earnings are forecasted to rise 3% to $2.55 per share with earnings estimate revisions slightly higher over the last quarter. Sales are projected to be up 3% to $44.22 billion. More impressive, Fiscal 2023 would represent 38% growth over the last five years with 2018 sales at $31.85 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn comparison, Pepsi’s earnings are expected to jump 7% in FY23 at $7.25 per share with earnings estimates remaining unchanged. Sales are forecasted to rise 3% in FY23 to $88.27 billion. Fiscal 2023 sales would be a 36% increase from five years ago, with 2018 sales at $64.66 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; Valuation Over the last year, Coca-Cola stock is down -3% to underperform Pepsi’s +3% but both have topped the S&amp;P 500’s -10%. In the last decade, Pepsi’s +213% total return which includes dividends has also topped Coca-Cola’s +118% but trailed the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe valuation of both Coca-Cola and Pepsi stock is very similar. Coca-Cola stock trades just under $60 a share and 23.4X forward earnings which is roughly on par with the industry average. This is 18% below its decade high of 28.5X and just above the median of 22.9X.Pivoting to Pepsi, shares of PEP trade at $172 per share and 23.6X forward earnings. This is 15% below its decade long high of 27.8X and 7% above the median of 21.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividends In regards to passive income, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi are Dividend Kings raising their payout for more than 50 consecutive years. To that note, Coca-Cola’s 2.95% dividend yield and annual increases (60 years) top Pepsi at the moment although the latter recently announced it will increase its dividend by 10% along with $1 billion worth of buybacks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway Leading up to its earnings next week, Coca-Cola stock currently sports a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) with Pepsi landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This is mostly attributed to Coca-Cola’s earnings estimates trending higher for fiscal 2023 while Pepsi’s FY23 estimates have remained unchanged although analysts haven’t had the time to offer updates after the company's Q4 report.Furthermore, Pepsi’s solid Q4 report may very well be an indication that Coca-Cola may give a positive quarterly report as well. Coca-Cola could also boost its dividend and offer buybacks to support shareholders. Ultimately, KO stock may be a more intriguing investment than PEP even though their fundamentals are very similar but Coca-Cola shares come with a more affordable price tag.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $2.95 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this flooring maker would post earnings of $3.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.34, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Mohawk Industries , which belongs to the Zacks Textile - Home Furnishing industry, posted revenues of $2.65 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.76 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Mohawk Industries shares have added about 18.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Mohawk Industries?While Mohawk Industries has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Mohawk Industries: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.68 on $2.77 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.51 on $10.92 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

416,00413261-cab8-3b9d-a998-68fd00d87075,MHK,2023-02-10,Mohawk Industries Reports Q4 2022 Results,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mohawk-industries-reports-q4-2022-211000499.html,1675977000,STORY,['MHK'],"[Mohawk Industries, Inc.CALHOUN, Ga., Feb. 09, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mohawk Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MHK) today announced fourth quarter 2022 net earnings of $33 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.52. Adjusted net earnings were $84 million and adjusted EPS was $1.32, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 4.0% as reported and 1.3% on a constant currency and days basis. For the fourth quarter of 2021, net sales were $2.8 billion, net earnings were $189 million and EPS was $2.80. Adjusted net earnings were $199 million, and adjusted EPS was $2.95, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges.For the twelve months ending December 31, 2022, net earnings and EPS were $25 million and $0.39, respectively. Adjusted net earnings excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges were $823 million and adjusted EPS was $12.85. For the 2022 twelve-month period, net sales were approximately $11.7 billion, an increase of 4.8% versus prior year as reported or 8.8% on a constant currency and days basis. For the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2021, net sales were approximately $11.2 billion, net earnings were $1,033 million and EPS was $14.94; excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges, adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS were $1,027 million and $14.86, respectively.Commenting on Mohawk Industries’ full year and fourth quarter performance, Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum, Chairman and CEO, stated, “After a strong beginning to 2022, the U.S. housing market declined under pressure from rising interest rates and high inflation. In Europe, energy and overall inflation escalated, and consumers reduced discretionary spending to pay for essentials. With lower home sales and residential remodeling in the second half of the year, our flooring volumes decreased. Throughout the year, commercial new construction and remodeling activity outperformed residential.”Story continuesMohawk concluded 2022 with a strong balance sheet, low net debt leverage of 1.3 times EBITDA and available liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion to manage the current environment and optimize our long-term results. During 2022, we acquired 5 small bolt-on businesses that extend the scope of our product offering and distribution. This month, we completed the acquisition of Elizabeth, a leading Brazilian ceramic producer, and we are awaiting regulatory approval for our acquisition of Vitromex in Mexico. Both Vitromex and Elizabeth will almost double our local market positions, expand our customer base and product offering and improve our manufacturing capabilities.Our fourth quarter revenues were driven by price increases and strength in the commercial channel, which continued to benefit from ongoing remodeling and new construction projects. Sales across our businesses were slower than we expected in the quarter as residential flooring sales contracted with rising interest rates, declining home sales and lower consumer confidence. As a consequence, our customers lowered their inventory levels, and consumers reduced spending for renovation. In response, we scaled back production rates and lowered our inventories, which increased unabsorbed overhead expenses. We curtailed spending across the enterprise, though inflation offset many of our initiatives. In both Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World, we are taking restructuring actions in specific areas to align our operations with the present market conditions. We have reduced our planned capital spending until we see greater certainty in our markets around the world. During the quarter, energy and material costs around the world began to decline, which should positively affect our future results.For the fourth quarter, the Global Ceramic Segment delivered a 4.0% increase in net sales as reported, or 5.2% on a constant currency and days basis. The Segment’s operating margin was 7.0% as reported or 7.1% on an adjusted basis as a result of improved pricing and product mix as well as productivity gains, partially offset by inflation and lower volumes. As residential remodeling sales softened in the quarter, the Segment’s sales and earnings benefited from a higher mix of new residential construction and commercial sales than Mohawk’s overall business. The costs of energy and transportation are declining, which will benefit our margins as these costs flow through our inventory. In the U.S., ceramic sales and volumes both increased due to our premium product offering, price increases and growing countertop business. To support additional growth in our quartz countertop sales, we are adding manufacturing capacity by the end of this year. Our ceramic business in Europe remains under pressure with slowing demand, customer inventory reductions and inflation. Our costs in Europe were impacted by peak energy prices in the third quarter and reductions in plant volumes from temporary shutdowns. Natural gas prices have declined substantially, though disruptions could impact future costs. We are completing the expansion of our large porcelain slab manufacturing in Italy to support continued growth and enhance our styling. Sales in both Mexico and Brazil decelerated in the quarter as inflation and increasing interest rates reduced residential demand. We anticipate continued near-term weakness and have reduced production levels in both countries.During the fourth quarter, our Flooring Rest of the World Segment’s net sales decreased by 9.9% as reported or 1.9% on a constant currency and days basis. The Segment’s operating margin was 5.0% as reported or 7.7% on an adjusted basis, as a result of favorable pricing and product mix offset by inflation, lower volumes and temporary plant shutdowns. Natural gas prices in Europe peaked at an unprecedented level in the third quarter, raising our material and production costs. Since the beginning of 2023, gas prices have declined substantially, and material costs should follow. We remain focused on optimizing volume with selective promotions as well as controlling costs until the business improves. During the quarter, our European flooring categories experienced significant volume declines, with many residential remodeling projects being postponed as inflation eroded consumer discretionary spending. Our sheet vinyl sales outperformed our other flooring categories as consumers chose lower-priced alternatives. We are expanding our rigid LVT offering as it takes share from flexible. We are increasing existing operations and adding new rigid production that makes smaller runs with additional patented features. We will phase out of the residential flexible LVT products and will close the supporting production. The total cost of this new restructuring initiative is approximately $45 million, with a cash cost of approximately $7.5 million, resulting in annualized cost savings of $15 million and significantly increased sales. Our insulation business is growing as conserving energy has become a higher priority and building requirements have increased. We are increasing our insulation sales and distribution in the U.K. as we start up our new plant. Our panels business has faced the same pressures as our other categories with softening demand and rising material prices. Our businesses in Australia and New Zealand are slowing with the local economies, as inflation and mortgage rates are impacting flooring sales. In this market, we have announced additional price increases and are initiating selective promotions and updating our product offering to maximize our sales.In the fourth quarter, our Flooring North America Segment sales decreased 6.8%. The Segment had a negative operating margin of 3.1% as reported, or approximately breakeven on an adjusted basis, as a result of favorable pricing and product mix offset by inflation, temporary plant shutdowns and lower volumes. The Segment’s sales in the quarter slowed faster than we anticipated, primarily due to declines in residential channels, rug sales and customer inventory reductions. Earnings in the Segment were compressed due to lower sales, consumption of higher cost materials, reduced inventory levels and temporary plant shutdowns. In response to slower market conditions, we are completing our previously-announced restructuring actions, deferring capital projects and reducing discretionary spending. Reductions in energy and material costs should become a tailwind in the second quarter. Our commercial business remains solid as remodeling and new construction projects continue. The multifamily channel was the strongest residential performer, and we are re-aligning resources to focus more on this sector. Our resilient sales grew in the quarter as we leveraged our WetProtect and antimicrobial technologies to differentiate our collections. The first phase of our new West Coast LVT plant is operating at expected levels, and we are preparing new technologies that will improve costs and add differentiated features. Our premium laminate sales were impacted by slowing retail traffic and customer inventory adjustments. Our new laminate manufacturing line, which began last year, is operating at planned levels and will deliver our next generation of features.The flooring industry is slowing due to higher interest rates, sustained inflation and low consumer confidence. Visibility of the depth and duration of this cycle is limited, and conditions differ across the world. Mohawk has a strong record of managing through these downturns by proactively executing the necessary actions. We are adjusting our business for the current conditions by reducing production levels, inventory, cost structures and capital expenditures. We are implementing restructuring actions in both Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World to streamline operations, reduce SG&amp;A and rationalize higher cost assets. In the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate more pressure on our pricing and mix due to low industry volumes. Our inventory costs remain elevated in most product categories due to the higher material and energy costs that we incurred in earlier periods. Additionally, we will not raise production as normal in the first quarter to prepare for future demand, increasing our unabsorbed costs. The cost of energy has fallen and should benefit our global margins as our inventory turns. Our second quarter results should have sequentially stronger improvement, with seasonally higher sales, increased production and lower material costs. Significantly lower energy costs in Europe should enhance consumer spending, discretionary purchases and flooring demand. We are refocusing our sales teams on the channels that are performing better in the current environment. We are introducing innovative new collections and merchandising as well as utilizing targeted promotions to improve sales. Given these factors, we anticipate our first quarter adjusted EPS to be between $1.24 and $1.34, excluding any restructuring, acquisition and other charges.Around the world, the long-term demand for housing will require significant investments in new construction and remodeling. Mohawk is uniquely positioned with a comprehensive array of innovative products, industry-leading distribution and strength in all sales channels. We are currently implementing structural changes to navigate the industry’s challenges while optimizing our future results. While we are managing the present economic cycle, we operate with a long-term perspective and are expanding capacity in areas where we have the greatest growth potential when markets rebound, including LVT, laminate, quartz countertops, porcelain slabs and insulation. We anticipate coming out of this downturn in a stronger position as we benefit from our bolt-on acquisitions, enhanced market positions in Brazil and Mexico and strategic expansion of our high-growth product categories. Our balance sheet is well positioned to manage the current cycle and to drive future growth and profitability.ABOUT MOHAWK INDUSTRIESMohawk Industries is the leading global flooring manufacturer that creates products to enhance residential and commercial spaces around the world.

These data were presented as an oral presentation (Abstract #258) at the 12th Conference of the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation, held from February 8-10, 2023, in Florence, Italy.The study previously met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that at Week 16 – the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the study – patients receiving povorcitinib once daily (QD) had significantly greater decreases from baseline in Abscess and Inflammatory Nodule (AN) count versus placebo (least squares mean change, −2.5 [0.9], placebo vs. −5.2 [0.9], P=0.0277, povorcitinib 15 mg; −6.9 [0.9], P=0.0006, povorcitinib 45 mg; −6.3 [0.9], P=0.0021), povorcitinib 75 mg)2.New results at Week 52, which include the 36-week open-label extension period during which all patients received povorcitinib 75 mg once daily (QD), show that average efficacy was sustained for all treatment arms following the switch to povorcitinib 75 mg QD (mean change in AN count from Day 1 baseline at Week 52 was −5.7 [7.3], placebo→75 mg; −8.4 [5.6], 15→75 mg; −10.4 [14.6], 45→75 mg; and −5.4 [5.6], 75 mg). Importantly, povorcitinib also demonstrated durable efficacy at Week 52 in high-threshold outcomes, as evidenced by 22-29% of patients achieving HS Clinical Response 100 (HiSCR100), which is defined as a 100% reduction from baseline in total AN count with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.Story continuesPovorcitinib was generally well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previously-reported data. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) at Week 52 (n=174) were COVID-19 (21.3%), acne (11.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.9%), headache (5.7%), nasopharyngitis (5.7%), urinary tract infection (5.7%) and increased blood creatine kinase (CK) (5.2%). In total, six patients (3.4%) experienced a TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation. No fatal TEAEs were observed.""HS is a chronic, progressive and debilitating condition for which there is no cure. We are encouraged by these Phase 2 data and believe they reinforce the potential of povorcitinib to be a safe and efficacious treatment for HS that is tolerable with longer-term administration, even at the higher doses,"" said Kurt Brown, M.D., Global Program Head, Povorcitinib, and Associate Vice President, Drug Development, Inflammation &amp; AutoImmunity, Incyte. ""Despite the available treatments for HS, no uniformly-effective therapy has been found, underscoring the need for additional options. We look forward to continuing to progress the development of povorcitinib through our ongoing Phase 3 trial in patients with moderate-to-severe HS.""Additional 52-week efficacy results include:Placebo → Povorcitinib75 mg armPovorcitinib 15 → 75 mg armPovorcitinib 45 → 75 mg armPovorcitinib 75 mg arm(Patients, %)(Patients, %)(Patients, %)(Patients, %)HiSCR59.364.766.761.3HiSCR7540.750.050.051.6HiSCR9025.935.333.332.3HiSCR10022.229.423.329.0(Patients, %)(Patients, %)(Patients, %)(Patients, %)ISH4-5559.373.576.761.3ISH4-7551.955.960.045.2ISH4-9037.035.330.032.3ISH4-10022.229.420.025.8HiSCR, HS Clinical Response – ≥50% reduction from baseline in AN count with no increase in the number of abscesses or draining tunnels; HiSCR75/90/100, ≥75%, ≥90%, and 100% reduction from baseline in AN count with no increase in the number of abscesses or draining tunnels; ISH4, International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System; IHS455/75/90/100, ≥55%/75%/90%/100% reduction from baseline in IHS4 score.""Given the nature of HS, which presents with persistent, painful nodules and abscesses, this immune-mediated skin condition often has a severe impact on a patient’s quality of life,"" said Joslyn Kirby, M.D., M.S., M.Ed., Associate Professor and Vice Chair for Education, Department of Dermatology at Penn State Health. ""I am encouraged by these promising results suggesting that povorcitinib may be a favorable oral treatment option that could provide substantial relief from common HS symptoms for patients.""This presentation will be made available for registered participants on the EHSF website at https://www.eventclass.org/contxt_ehsf2023/scientific/online-program/session?s=S-09#e268 and can be accessed until August 31, 2023.About Hidradenitis SuppurativaHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by painful nodules and abscesses that can lead to irreversible tissue destruction and scarring.1 Over-activity of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is believed to drive inflammation involved in the pathogenesis and progression of HS3. More than 150,000 patients in the U.S. are estimated to have moderate to severe HS4. Given the debilitating nature of condition, it can have a profoundly negative effect on patients’ quality of life5.About the Phase 2 Study (NCT04476043)This Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of povorcitinib (formerly INCB54707) in adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).The first part of the study spanned 16 weeks and enrolled 209 adults (aged 18-75 years) who were randomized 1:1:1:1 to povorcitinib 15 mg once daily (QD; n=52), 45 mg QD (n=52), 75 mg QD (n=53) or placebo (n=52). Eligible patients had an HS (Hurley stage I, II or III) disease duration of ≥3 months prior to screening, and active HS in at least two distinct anatomical areas. The primary efficacy endpoint is mean change from baseline in Abscess and Inflammatory Nodule (AN) count at Week 16. The key secondary endpoint is percentage of patients achieving HS Clinical Response (HiSCR; ≥50% reduction from baseline in AN count with no increase in number of abscesses or draining tunnels) at Week 16.The second part of the study, the open-label extension (OLE) period, spanned an additional 36 weeks (52 weeks total) and included patients enrolled in the first part of the study. All OLE patient participants (n=174) received treatment with povorcitinib 75 mg QD. After Week 52, patients who completed baseline, Week 16 and Week 52 assessments could continue to receive open-label treatment with povorcitinib 75 mg QD for an additional 48 weeks.Endpoints at Week 52 include mean change from baseline in AN count, HiSCR and HiSCR75/90/100 (≥75%/90%/100% reduction from baseline in AN count with no increase in the number of abscesses or draining tunnels), HS flare occurrence, mean change from baseline in International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) and IHS455/75/90/100 (≥55%/75%/90%/100% reduction from baseline in IHS4 score). Safety of povorcitinib was assessed by the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).For more information about this Phase 2 study, please visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04476043.About Povorcitinib (INCB54707)Povorcitinib (INCB54707) is an oral small-molecule JAK1 inhibitor currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), vitiligo and prurigo nodularis.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Christine Chiou, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Christine.Christine Chiou: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. The slides presented today are available for download on the Investors section of our website. Joining me on the call today are HervÃ©, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks; and Dash, who will join us for the Q&amp;A. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our reports filed with the SEC. We will now begin the call with HervÃ©.HervÃ© Hoppenot: Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was another successful year in which we delivered strong commercial performance and made significant advancements across all stages of our oncology and dermatology pipeline. Revenues from our current portfolio of commercialized products grew 18% year-over-year, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year to $764 million and $2.7 billion, respectively. Total revenues for the year, which include our royalty, grew 14% to $3.4 billion. As we look across our portfolio, the drivers of this double-digit growth are the continued commercial execution for Jakafi, net sales of which increased $275 million in the year to reach $2.4 billion and initial contributions from recently launched products and indications, including Minjuvi and Pemazyre in Europe and Japan and Opzelura in the U.S. I want to touch briefly on Opzelura, which we believe will be a significant growth driver for Incyte.Story continuesOpzelura was approved in September 2021 for atopic dermatitis. And this past July, we received approval and launched Opzelura in vitiligo as the first FDA-approved therapy for repigmentation. The approval was well received by dermatologists, patients and patient advocacy group and the launch has been very successful. Strong patient demand and increasing formulary access drove net sales of $61 million in the fourth quarter and $129 million for the full year. In 2023, we expect an approval for Opzelura in vitiligo in Europe, which adds another layer of growth for the franchise. Turning now to our regulatory and R&amp;D achievements. Our clinical development pipeline is focused on three therapeutic areas: MPN GVHD, other hematology and oncology, and dermatology.And we made significant progress across each of these three areas. In LIMBER, we presented new data from ongoing combination studies and disclosed an important new discovery asset targeting mutant CALR which has the potential to be a disease-modifying therapy for approximately 30% of patients in MF and ET. In other hematology and oncology, we presented updated data for our oral PD-L1 inhibitor 280, which shows promise both as a monotherapy and combination agent. We also progressed parsaclisib into Phase 3 for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a disease in which there are no approved therapies. And in dermatology, we continue to expand our portfolio with Opzelura and povorcitinib, focusing in disease area where there is a significant unmet need.Lastly, we had two important updates relating to patents. The first is that Incyte earned pediatric exclusivity, which entitled Incyte to six months of exclusivity added to our patents for Jakafi and Opzelura. This expands our ability to enforce our Jakafi patents through December 2028. This expansion further applied to our existing Opzelura patent. In addition, late last year, we obtained an issued patent and allowed claims for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and vitiligo, respectively. We are confident in the strength of these claims permitting us to protect Opzelura out to 2040 in the U.S. Before moving into the outlook for 2023, I wanted to take a moment to look back at the growth of our product revenues as shown on Slide 6. Over the past five years, approvals for new products and indications as well as strong commercial execution of our existing portfolio, has allowed us to grow our product revenues at a CAGR of 18%.On Slide 7, looking at our historical operational performance. On the left is our revenues versus our total R&amp;D and SG&amp;A spend. We have delivered strong operational performance over the past five years with total revenue growing at a 17% CAGR and our operating expenses growing at a 13% CAGR. On the right, we are showing our operating leverage, excluding the impact of dermatology on revenues, and sales and marketing expenses. Here, you can see our operating performance is even more pronounced. We can expect to drive further operating leverage over time with our high-growth dermatology franchise, which is in early stages of launch and where we could see two additional approvals in the near term. Turning to Slide 8. As we look ahead for Incyte, there are four main drivers of sustainable growth, and we are already making significant progress in each of these areas and expect to continue to strong momentum throughout -- to continue the strong momentum throughout 2023.The first driver is our Jakafi franchise and LIMBER program, where we aim to expand our leadership in MPN and GVHD. In 2023, beyond the approval of ruxolitinib XR, we expect important data, including pivotal results for our parsaclisib combination in suboptimal responders to Jakafi in MF. Next is Opzelura where we are launching in AD and vitiligo and where in 2023, we will be launching in Europe. In other areas of clinical development, we expect new data from our oral PD-L1 program and povorcitinib in prurigo nodularis and vitiligo. Lastly, we will be monitoring early data from our CDK2 and mutant CALR program. With that, I would like to pass the call to Barry.Barry Flannelly: Thank you, HervÃ©, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, Jakafi net sales grew 9% year-over-year to $647 million and grew 13% for the full year to $2.4 billion. Total patient demand rose 7% in 2022, driven by an increase in new patients across all indications. The launch of Jakafi in chronic GVHD continues to be strong with the total number of patients in Q4 growing 11% versus prior year quarter. A key driver of growth in GVHD is the duration of therapy; and based on recent data, the average duration, which includes both acute and chronic, is approximately 15 months. On Slide 11, as you can see on the left, Jakafi has grown consistently year-over-year ranging from $200 million to $250 million each year.We expect to continue strong growth in 2023 with full year net product revenues to be between $2.53 billion to $2.63 billion. Turning to Opzelura on Slide 12. We had a strong quarter for Opzelura with continued double-digit sequential growth in patient demand in atopic dermatitis and a very successful launch in vitiligo. As you can see on the chart on the right, total demand, which includes both free and paid drug, grew 34% in Q4 versus prior quarter to reach 84,700 units, driven by both new patient growth and an increasing number of refills. Paid demand, as shown by the light blue bars, grew 52% in Q4, driven by continued improvements in formulary access. As a result, net sales grew 61% versus prior quarter to $61 million. Total full year net sales for Opzelura were $129 million.Looking ahead, we expect both AD and vitiligo to be significant growth drivers for Opzelura. In AD, Opzelura is the #1 prescribed branded agent for new AD patients and its impact on itch, which remains unmatched by any other topical therapy continues to be the primary driver of prescribing. We expect the efficacy profile of Opzelura to continue to drive uptake in AD. In terms of additional near-term growth opportunities, pending the results from the Phase 3 trial, we could see an approval in pediatric AD next year for two to 11-year olds. In vitiligo, the size of the market and the potential opportunity is substantial. There are an estimated 1.5 million patients diagnosed with vitiligo in the U.S. And prior to Opzelura's approval, an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 patients were motivated to seek treatment.Laboratory, Health, ResearchPhoto by CDC on UnsplashAs you know, Opzelura is the first and only product to be approved to help patients repigment their skin and this provides us with an opportunity to activate many of the 1.3 million patients that are naive to treatment or who have stopped seeking treatment altogether. And in the next few months, we expect the approval of Opzelura in vitiligo in Europe, where there are an estimated 1.5 million diagnosed patients living with the disease. Slide 14 shows a few examples of patient advocacy and consumer activity within the vitiligo community. We are already seeing high awareness and excitement for Opzelura from patients, and we will continue to build on that momentum throughout the year, including the commencement of TV direct-to-consumer this quarter.And lastly, on Monjuvi, Minjuvi and Pemazyre. Monjuvi sales in Q4 were $24 million, up 13% year-over-year, and revenues were $89 million for the year. The launch of Minjuvi is ongoing in four markets, and we continue to gain reimbursement in other European countries. Net sales for the full year were $20 million, which includes a negative $2 million of foreign exchange impact. Pemazyre grew to $83 million in net sales in 2022 with $20 million coming from outside the U.S.; again, negatively impacted by foreign exchange by $3 million. In the U.S. Pemazyre continues to grow in total patients on therapy and is established as the standard of care for patients living with cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 alterations. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steven.Steven Stein: Thank you, Barry, and good morning, everyone. We made significant progress across our clinical development portfolio in 2022. We had multiple clinical and regulatory achievements throughout the year and I would like to use the next few slides to highlight a few of the key programs. Starting with our LIMBER program on Slide 18. Key data were presented at the 2022 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting where we had 57 abstracts accepted for presentations. Highlighting two of those presentations, starting on the left, we presented initial results of the Phase 1/2 study evaluating our ALK2 inhibitor zilurgisertib in monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib, which demonstrated improvement in anemia and hemoglobin responses in patients with myelofibrosis.Additionally, we disclosed our discovery of 989, a novel anti-mutant calreticulin monoclonal antibody, which has been shown to selectively inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of cells harboring mutant CALR, while not affecting wild type or normal healthy cells. On the right is a list of key updates across LIMBER that are expected this calendar year. Starting with ruxolitinib XR, we have a PDUFA date of March 23 this year, and the expected approval is an important step towards fixed-dose combinations with parsaclisib, zilurgisertib and our BET inhibitor. In terms of data, we expect pivotal Phase 3 data of ruxolitinib plus parsaclisib in suboptimal responders as well as more mature data sets of ruxolitinib with ALK2 and BET in the second half of this year.Depending on what we see with our ALK2 and BET combinations, we could potentially see the start of pivotal trials with one or both of these compounds. Early in the pipeline is our anti-mutant CALR monoclonal antibody, which will enter the clinic this year. With regards to graft versus host disease, we are expecting pivotal data midyear from AGAVE-201, a study evaluating axatilimab in third-line chronic graft versus host disease. Moving to the rest of our hematology and oncology portfolio. Key data for the small molecule oral PD-L1 program were presented at the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting. Both 280 and 318 demonstrated clinical activity with tumor shrinkage and were generally well tolerated and we expect to share more mature data set in the second half of this year.In addition, we plan to initiate combination trials of 280 with adagrasib, CTLA-4 and an oral VEGF inhibitor in the first half of this year. INCB123667, our novel potent and selective oral small molecule inhibitor of CDK2 entered Phase 1 clinical development. Yes, we could see utility in cyclin E amplified or overexpressing cancers as well as in cancers that are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Now looking at our dermatology franchise on Slide 20. In July of last year, Opzelura gained its second indication in vitiligo. This was a huge achievement for the vitiligo community and people living with the disease. As we continue to maximize the potential with ruxolitinib cream, we initiated multiple Phase 2 studies in different conditions, including lichen planus, lichen sclerosis and hidradenitis suppurativa.In each of these diseases, there are no topical or oral therapies approved. We have many important milestones in dermatology upcoming in 2023, ruxolitinib cream, the CHMP opinion in vitiligo is currently on track for the first quarter of this year, while data from the Phase 3 vitiligo maintenance and withdrawal study and the Phase 3 pediatric AD study will be available in the first and second half, respectively. Turning to povorcitinib. We expect Phase 2 data in both vitiligo and prurigo nodularis later this year. And additionally, I want to highlight that later this week at the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation we have an oral presentation of the updated 52-week data from our Phase 2 study in HS, which should provide some additional insights into the durability of response with this agent.And lastly, auremolimab our newly acquired IL-15 receptor beta monoclonal antibody is expected to enter the clinic for vitiligo. As you can see on Slide 21, we're looking forward to another busy year with multiple regulatory and clinical updates. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.Christiana Stamoulis: Thank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong revenue growth with total product revenues of $764 million, representing an increase of 18% over the fourth quarter of 2021. Total product revenues are comprised of $647 million for Jakafi, $55 million for other hematology/oncology products and $61 million for Opzelura. Net product revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in Jakafi and Opzelura net revenues. Other hematology/oncology net revenues, which include revenues from Iclusig, Pemazyre and Minjuvi were impacted by unfavorable changes in FX rates. On a constant currency basis, other hematology/oncology net product revenues grew by 23% over the prior year period.Total royalty revenues for the quarter were $132 million and are comprised of royalties from Novartis of $91 million for Jakavi and $4 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $36 million for Olumiant. Jakavi and Olumiant royalties for the quarter were negatively impacted by FX headwinds, while Olumiant royalties were also impacted by a decrease in net product sales of Olumiant for use as a treatment for COVID-19. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related sales and currency fluctuation, Olumiant royalties increased 23% compared to the prior year period. For the full year 2022, total net product revenues were $2.7 billion and total revenues were $3.4 billion, representing 18% and 14% year-over-year increase, respectively. Moving to Slide 25.Opzelura net product revenues for the quarter were $61 million, driven by robust demand and broadening payer access. As payers continue to add Opzelura to formularies and the share of covered claims increase, we continue to see improvement in the gross to net discount rate. The gross to net discount rate decreased from an average of 71% in the third quarter of 2022 to an average of 57% in the fourth quarter of this year, and we exited 2022 at a gross to net discount rate of 50%. While we will continue to work on reducing patient co-pay and in turn, improving gross to net, an average gross to net of 50% is a good working assumption for 2023 with a gross net discount in the first quarter of the year expected to be higher than subsequent quarters as plans reset patient deductibles at the beginning of the year.I would also like to take the opportunity to update you on the Opzelura prescriptions data provided by IQVIA. As you see on Slide 26, in Q4, we saw the gap between the actual number of total prescriptions and the number of prescriptions reported by IQVIA, narrowing. While the IQVIA data continues to overstate demand, this overstatement has been reduced to a level of 5% to 10%, which is within expectations for a newly launched product. In addition, it is important to note that IQVIA data reflects total demand, which includes both paid prescriptions and free drug. Going forward, free drug is expected to represent around 20% of total demand. When looking at IQVIA data, one would need to adjust for this overstatement as well as for free drug in order to get a better sense of paid demand.Moving on to Slide 27 and our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&amp;D expenses were $431 million for the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the full year 2022. Total R&amp;D expenses, which include the upfront consideration of $70 million for our acquisition of Villaris were $501 million for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2022, total R&amp;D expenses, which in addition to the Villaris upfront payment also include $56 million in other milestone payment, were $1.6 billion representing a 9% year-over-year increase. The increase was primarily due to the progression of our pipeline and was partially offset by lower upfront and milestone expenses in 2022. Total SG&amp;A expenses were $273 million for the fourth quarter and $1 billion for the full year 2022.The year-over-year increase was driven by investments related to the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the launch of Opzelura in atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. Moving on to 2023. I will now discuss the key components of our guidance on a GAAP basis. For Jakafi, we expect net product revenues to be in the range of $2.53 billion to $2.63 billion, which at the midpoint represents an increase of approximately $170 million over 2022, driven by continued growth across all indications. We expect our gross to net adjustments for 2023 to be approximately 23%, reflecting expected continued growth in 340B volumes. As a reminder, the gross to net adjustment in the first quarter of the year is always higher relative to other quarter and previous quarter and subsequent quarters due to our share of the donut hole for Medicare participation.For other hematology/oncology products, which include Pemazyre in the U.S., EU and Japan, and Iclusig and Minjuvi in Europe, we are expecting total net product revenues to be in the range of $215 million to $225 million. Turning to operating expenses on a GAAP basis, we expect COGS in a range of 7% to 8% of net product revenues, which is in line with 2022. R&amp;D expenses are expected to be in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion, representing 3% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. SG&amp;A expenses are expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, primarily reflecting continued investment in Opzelura and the full year impact of the investment in the vitiligo indication.

420,d08046e7-2b0a-3d12-baf6-01ba36eaaa07,WM,2023-02-10,Waste Management's (NYSE:WM) Shareholders Will Receive A Bigger Dividend Than Last Year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-managements-nyse-wm-shareholders-104838731.html,1676026118,STORY,['WM'],"[Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 24th of March to $0.70. This will take the annual payment to 1.8% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. View our latest analysis for Waste Management Waste Management's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Prior to this announcement, Waste Management's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 39.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 37%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWaste Management Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.42, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.0% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Waste Management May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings have grown at around 4.3% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. Waste Management is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. While this isn't necessarily a negative, it definitely signals that dividend growth could be constrained in the future unless earnings start to pick up again.Story continuesWaste Management Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Waste Management is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Although revenues were on recovering trend during 2022 on the back of normalizing of economies, the macro headwinds hurt margins.The Zacks Medical – Products industry bore the brunt along with broader market participants. New product launches and expansion into new territories are likely to drive revenues going forward. A strong demand trend in certain medical procedures related to pacing, cardiac surgery, neurovascular and diabetes are encouraging.However, the weaknesses in the industry’s bottom line is likely to continue in the first half of 2023. The impact of rising cost is likely to come down as we proceed down the year. The industry participants are gradually raising prices of product and services along with cost-cutting initiatives to offset inflationary pressure.The European and international markets are also showing signs of a steady recovery in demand for medical products. Meanwhile, COVID-19 impacts remain uncertain. However, declining demand for tests is hurting revenues.Despite the ongoing macro headwinds, several industry players have not shown signs of slowing down yet. Industry participants like Stryker, Zimmer Biomet and Haemonetics are likely to gain from the rebound in demand and new cost-cutting initiatives.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. The industry players are primarily focused on research and development. The industry participants primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few. Strengthening dollar and labor shortage are hurting top-line growth.Story continuesLockdowns across several countries, notably China, in the first half of 2022 led to significant supply chain disruptions. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue in 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures along with cost-cutting initiatives is likely to drive industry performance going forward.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising utilization of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space.There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being utilized to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Rising Demand for IVD: Toward the end of February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak started to spread rapidly and took the shape of a pandemic. This led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development.Companies not only received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well-poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #161, which places it in the bottom 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

Although revenues were on recovering trend during 2022 on the back of normalizing of economies, the macro headwinds hurt margins. The Zacks Medical – Products industry bore the brunt along with broader market participants. New product launches and expansion into new territories are likely to drive revenues going forward. A strong demand trend in certain medical procedures related to pacing, cardiac surgery, neurovascular and diabetes are encouraging. However, the weaknesses in the industry’s bottom line is likely to continue in the first half of 2023. The impact of rising cost is likely to come down as we proceed down the year. The industry participants are gradually raising prices of product and services along with cost-cutting initiatives to offset inflationary pressure. The European and international markets are also showing signs of a steady recovery in demand for medical products. Meanwhile, COVID-19 impacts remain uncertain. However, declining demand for tests is hurting revenues.Despite the ongoing macro headwinds, several industry players have not shown signs of slowing down yet. Industry participants like Stryker SYK, Zimmer Biomet ZBH and Haemonetics HAE are likely to gain from the rebound in demand and new cost-cutting initiatives.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. The industry players are primarily focused on research and development. The industry participants primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few. Strengthening dollar and labor shortage are hurting top-line growth. Lockdowns across several countries, notably China, in the first half of 2022 led to significant supply chain disruptions. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue in 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures along with cost-cutting initiatives is likely to drive industry performance going forward.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising utilization of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space. There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being utilized to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Rising Demand for IVD: Toward the end of February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak started to spread rapidly and took the shape of a pandemic. This led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well-poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #161, which places it in the bottom 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

428,20cbeabf-fc25-38ad-a84e-b31ccb93fe1b,VMC,2023-02-10,Vulcan Materials (VMC) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vulcan-materials-vmc-reports-next-150103374.html,1675954863,STORY,"['VMC', 'SUM']","[Vulcan Materials (VMC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 16. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis construction materials company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.82 billion, up 13.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.58% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vulcan?For Vulcan, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.97%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vulcan will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Vulcan would post earnings of $1.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.78, delivering a surprise of +4.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Vulcan doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry, Summit Materials (SUM), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.29 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $555.2 million, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Summit Materials has been revised 3.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -5.02%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Summit Materials will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A copy of the Company’s fourth quarter 2022 supplemental package will be available on the Company's website at investors.regencycenters.com or by written request to: Investor Relations, Regency Centers Corporation, One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida, 32202. The supplemental package contains more detailed financial and property results including financial statements, an outstanding debt summary, acquisition and development activity, investments in partnerships, information pertaining to securities issued other than common stock, property details, a significant tenant rent report and a lease expiration table in addition to earnings and valuation guidance assumptions. The information provided in the supplemental package is unaudited and includes non-GAAP measures, and there can be no assurance that the information will not vary from the final information in the Company’s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2022. Regency may, but assumes no obligation to, update information in the supplemental package from time to time.Non-GAAP DisclosureWe believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.We do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of the Company.Nareit FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sale and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Regency computes Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition. Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sales and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of the Company’s financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders to Nareit FFO.Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure that excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses; (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market of debt adjustments; and (iv) other amounts as they occur. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income to Nareit FFO to Core Operating Earnings.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial, business, legal or other outcomes including business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Regency’s future events, developments, or financial or operational performance or results such as our 2023 Guidance, are “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “expect,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” “forecast,” “project,” “anticipate,” “guidance,” and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those risk factors described in our SEC filings. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as to the extent required by law. These risks and events include, without limitation:Risk Factors Related to the Current Economic EnvironmentContinued rising interest rates in the current economic environment may adversely impact our cost to borrow, real estate valuation, and stock price. Current economic challenges, including the potential for recession, may adversely impact our tenants and our business.Risk Factors Related to Pandemics or other Health CrisesPandemics or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Risk Factors Related to Operating Retail-Based Shopping CentersEconomic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow and increase our operating expenses. Shifts in retail trends, sales, and delivery methods between brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, and cash flows. Changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow. Our success depends on the continued presence and success of our “anchor” tenants. A percentage of our revenues are derived from “local” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if these tenants are not successful, or if the demand for the types or mix of tenants significantly change. We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. Many of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase, even if our lease income decreases. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other building, fire, and safety and regulations may have a material negative effect on us.Risk Factors Related to Real Estate InvestmentsOur real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income. We face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties. We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. We face risks associated with the acquisition of properties. We may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions. Changes in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate.Risk Factors Related to the Environment Affecting Our PropertiesClimate change may adversely impact our properties directly and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees. Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change. Costs of environmental remediation may adversely impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow.Risk Factors Related to Corporate MattersAn increased focus on metrics and reporting relating to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties. Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data or of Regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.Risk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint VenturesWe do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. The termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital StructureOur ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings. We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition. Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations. Hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us.Risk Factors Related to the Market Price for Our SecuritiesChanges in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities. There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at current or historical rates.Risk Factors Related to the Company’s Qualification as a REITIf the Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Dividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. Certain foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled” REIT. Legislative or other actions affecting REITs may have a negative effect on us or our investors. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.Risk Factors Related to the Company’s Common StockRestrictions on the ownership of the Company’s capital stock to preserve its REIT status may delay or prevent a change in control. The issuance of the Company's capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control. Ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.Christy McElroy904 598 7616ChristyMcElroy@regencycenters.com]"

437,e252b395-ae45-3846-8bb0-d13e7b956f73,PG,2023-02-10,Procter & Gamble Company (The) (PG) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-company-pg-attracting-140002078.html,1675951202,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned -8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, which P&amp;G falls in, has lost 6.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, indicating a change of -0.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.5%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.27 indicates a change of +7.3% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, P&amp;G is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.27 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $80.5 billion and $83.84 billion estimates indicate +0.4% and +4.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.9%. EPS of $1.59 for the same period compares with $1.66 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.81%. The EPS surprise was +0.63%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:UDR) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 7, 2023Operator: Greetings and welcome to the UDR, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Trent Trujillo, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Trent. You may begin.Trent Trujillo: Welcome to UDR's quarterly financial results conference call. Our press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements. Statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurances that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC.We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions to one plus a follow-up. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered during the Q&amp;A session today. I will now turn the call over to UDR's Chairman and CEO, Tom Toomey.Thomas Toomey: Thank you, Trent and welcome to UDR's fourth quarter 2022 conference call. Presenting on the call with me today are President and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Fisher and Senior Vice President of Operations, Mike Lacey, who will discuss our results. Senior officers Andrew Cantor and Chris Van Ens, will also be available during the Q&amp;A portion of the call. To begin, 2022 was an exceptional year for UDR. First, our same-store revenue growth was near the top of the sector and we achieved record high full year same-store NOI growth of 14% and FFOA per share growth of 16%. Second, we further advanced our already industry leading operating platform by investing in our people, which included establishing a 16-person task force to generate and execute innovation initiatives.Story continuesAdditionally, we engaged in various PropTech and ClimateTech investments. Together, these resources should further expand our peer-leading operating margin into the future. Third, we adhered to the capital market signals, growing opportunistically when our equity was attractively priced early in the year and actively pivoting to a capital-light strategy when our cost of capital increased. Being a good steward of your capital is paramount. Fourth, while we had next to zero debt maturities in 2022, we continue to reduce leverage, strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our liquidity. And last, we were honored to be recognized by a variety of organizations for our ongoing commitment to our associates, stakeholders and the environment. These include UDR earned a 5-star ESG designation from GRESB, the highest rating possible.Company was named by Newsweek as one of America's most responsible companies for the second year in a row and institutional investors recognize our ESG program, our board, IRR team and numerous executives being top three in the respective categories among all U.S. REITs. In short, we have the right strategy and leadership in place to continue to propel UDR forward. Looking ahead to 2023, we are very aware of the wide range of economic scenarios that are forecasted to play out, but we build our strategy around diversification and the ability to perform in any environment. This is well demonstrated by our history of cash flow growth and TSR outperformance, specifically an 11% TSR compounded annual growth rate over my 22 years at UDR. The constant over this time is our focus on what we can control and how that sets up for relative long-term outperformance?This includes: first, the strong relative setup of U.S. multifamily industry. Housing is a needs-based business, supply is stable, demand and traffic remain healthy, job growth has remained positive, rent to income levels are steady, and relative affordability versus single-family ownership and rentership remain near all-time highs, while the cost of capital across the industry continues to improve. Second, the favorable setup for UDR within the industry. We entered 2023 with approximately 5% earnings, the second highest amongst our peers and the highest in UDR's history. Innovation initiatives and prudent capital allocation should enhance this growth through margin yield expansion. Furthermore, our balance sheet remains highly liquid with $1 billion of capacity and we have no debt maturing until 2024.And finally, we increased our dividend by a robust 10.5% this year, enhancing our already strong return profile. Taken together, we feel confident that we will effectively manage whatever macro environment we face and continue to produce strong absolute and relative results. In closing, I am very optimistic on the relative strength of the multifamily industry and UDR's relative advantages within the industry. We have a strong talented, experienced and innovative team, with a track record of strong relative performance. The key that unlocks our potential is our drive to continue to listen to our associates, our customers and stakeholders, which enables us to determine where we excel, where we can improve and how we can better innovate for the future.To my fellow associates, thank you for all you did during 2022 again to make UDR a successful year and I look forward to what will come in 2023. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.Mike Lacy: Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our fourth quarter same-store results, early 2023 trends, our full year 2023 same-store growth outlook, including factors that could drive results to either end of our guidance range and an update on our continued innovation and operating efficiencies. To begin, strong sequential same-store revenue growth of 2% drove year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth of 12.1% and 14.5% in the fourth quarter. Results were driven by: first, robust blended lease rate growth of 5.4% was well above historical norms for what is usually our slowest leasing period of the year. This growth locked in our approximate 5% 2023 earn-in, the highest level in our history by more than 200 basis points.House, Builders, BuildingPhoto by Ярослав Алексеенко on UnsplashSecond, sustained strong occupancy of 96.8% exhibited our ability to efficiently convert traffic into signed leases. Third, we remain focused on enhancing our rent roll, which resulted in higher turnover than expected from twice the usual volume of resident skips and evictions. And fourth, collection rates held steady. The number of long-term delinquent residents across our portfolio continues to trend closer to our historical average, with approximately 400 residents today or less than 1% of total units. This is down from over 700 delinquent residents earlier in 2022, helping to reduce our bad debt reserve. Next, early 2023 results and trends. In my experience, there are four primary indicators that help inform us of the strength of the operating environment.These include leasing traffic, concessions, absolute affordability and relative affordability. Thus far in 2023, we continue to see favorable trends. First, demand remains relatively healthy. Traffic is roughly in line with the elevated levels we saw a year ago and well above the long-term average, but prospective residents are taking longer to make their rental decisions. Second, concessions remain minimal and have been primarily concentrated in certain submarkets of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., averaging around 2 to 3 weeks. Recently, concessions of 1 week on average have appeared in Austin, Dallas and Denver. Third, our residents' balance sheet appear to be holding up, portfolio-wide wage growth has largely kept pace with rent growth since COVID began, resulting in steady rent to income levels in the low 20% range.To-date, we have seen scan evidence of residents doubling up. In fact, 42% of our households are single occupants, up slightly compared to pre-COVID levels. And last, relative affordability remains in our favor. Renting an apartment is approximately 50% less expensive than owning a home versus 35% less expensive pre-COVID. Only 8% of move-outs in the fourth quarter were due to home purchase, roughly 30% less than typical. With this backdrop, blended rate growth for the first quarter is expected to average between 3% and 4%, similar to historical norms and driven by renewal rate growth of 7% to 7.5%. New lease growth of negative 70 basis points in January was slightly below the pre-COVID average, but it is positive in February and we expect further improvement as we enter peak leasing season.Turning to full year 2023, our same-store revenue and NOI growth guidance is 6.75% and 7.5% respectively at the midpoints. We are also forecasting expense growth of 4.75% at the midpoint, with real estate taxes and insurance, the largest pressure points. Underlying the midpoint of our guidance range is a 2023 blended rate growth forecast of approximately 2% to 3%. We triangulated into this estimate using third-party forecast, input from our field teams and the output from a multifactor rent growth forecasting model we developed internally. Through our predictive analytics work, we have found that total income growth is the primary driver of market rent growth. Within this model, consensus expectations that job growth will be slightly negative in 2023 are fully offset by the expectation of approximately 3% wage growth.In addition, a declining homeownership rate and slowing, but still positive, consensus real GDP growth should continue to benefit market rent growth this year, offset somewhat by increased new supply. In short, even if job growth goes slightly negative, we still see a path to positive rent growth in 2023. With this in mind, our 6.75% same-store revenue growth guidance midpoint can be achieved through our approximate 5% earn-in, a 125 basis point contribution using a midyear convention from blended rate growth comprised of new and renewal rate growth of 1.5% and 3.5% respectively, an approximate 50 basis point contribution from our unique innovation initiatives. The high end of 7.75% would be achieved through improved year-over-year occupancy, additional accretion from innovation and blended rate growth similar to the pre-COVID average of 4%, comprised of new and renewal rate growth of 3% and 5%, respectively.Conversely, the low end of 5.75% reflects a 75 basis point contribution from full year blended rate growth of 1.5% comprised of flat new lease growth and 3% renewals, which is approximately 250 basis points below the pre-COVID average renewal rate. Because of the relative strength of our January and February blended rate growth, we need only nominal blended rate growth of 1% on average through the rest of the year to achieve the low end. For reference, even during past downturns, our lowest trailing four-quarter average renewal rate growth was approximately 2%. Ongoing regulatory challenges could impact our views as 2023 unfolds, but we should have visibility into 65% to 70% of our full year same-store revenue by the end of April. We plan to reassess our guidance assumptions at that time.Finally, we continue to drive forward on innovation with the intent of further expanding our 300 basis point controllable operating margin advantage versus peers. Initiatives underway are expected to generate at least $40 million in incremental NOI by year end 2025. $5 million to $10 million of this is included in our 2023 same-store guidance ranges and will largely be focused on revenue upside, such as our building-wide WiFi project that enables seamless whole-building connectivity, our customer experience project to enhance satisfaction and drive property-level ROI initiatives, and the expanded use of big data to improve our pricing engine. Innovation has and will continue to drive more dollars to our bottom line as we rollout initiatives across our legacy portfolio and on external growth over time.As an example, on the $2.6 billion of third-party acquisitions we completed between 2019 and 2021, innovation has accounted for an additional 50 basis points in yield expansion above what the market alone would have provided or around $13 million of incremental NOI. This translates to approximately $275 million of value creation. In closing, a special thanks goes out to all of our teams for their relentless efforts to drive the best results possible across our markets. Your performance in 2022 was exceptional. And with your help, we will continue to leverage new and the innovative tools to drive results in 2023 and beyond. I will now turn over the call to Joe.Joe Fisher: Thank you, Mike. The topics I will cover today include our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and our initial outlook for full year 2023, a summary of recent transactions and capital markets activity, and a balance sheet and liquidity update. Our fourth quarter FFO as adjusted per share of $0.61 achieved the midpoint of our previously provided guidance range. Full year 2022 FFOA as adjusted of $2.33 was 16% higher year-over-year, reflecting the company's second strongest year of earnings growth in its 50-year history. Similarly, our Board authorized a robust 10.5% increase to our dividend this year, enhancing our total return profile. Based on our AFFO per share guidance, our 2023 dividend of $1.68 reflects a payout ratio of 74%, in line with our historical average.Looking ahead, our full year 2023 FFOA per share guidance range is $2.45 to $2.53. The $2.49 midpoint represents a 7% annual increase supported by mid to high single-digit forecasted same-store NOI growth. The $0.16 increase versus our full year 2022 result of $2.33 is driven by the following: a $0.20 benefit from same-store and joint venture NOI, a $0.04 benefit from non-same-store communities through the continued successful lease-up of recently developed and redeveloped communities, offset by $0.06 from higher interest expense and a higher average share count, and $0.02 from increased G&amp;A expense and other corporate items. For the first quarter, our FFOA per share guidance range is $0.59 to $0.61 or a 9% year-over-year increase at the midpoint.The slight sequential decline is driven by higher average share count from the settlement of forward equity agreements at the end of the fourth quarter and the higher interest expense. Next, a transactions and capital markets update. First, in alignment with our shift towards a capital-light strategy in mid-2022, we made no acquisitions or DCP investments during the fourth quarter. And second, we generated approximately $220 million of capital from dispositions and forward equity settlements. Specifically, during the quarter, we sold 1 community in Orange County, California for approximately $42 million and settled all remaining forward equity sales agreements at roughly $57 per share or a 20% premium to current consensus NAV and a 35% premium to our recent share price.We used the proceeds to further improve our balance sheet and execute approximately $21 million of share repurchases at a 20% discount to consensus NAV and a high 5% implied cap rate. Next, our investment grade balance sheet remains liquid and fully capable of funding our capital needs. Some highlights include: first, we have only $115 million of consolidated debt or approximately 0.5% of enterprise value scheduled to mature through 2024 after excluding amounts on our credit facilities and our commercial paper program. Our proactive approach to managing our balance sheet has resulted in the best 3-year liquidity outlook in the sector and the lowest weighted average interest rate amongst the multifamily peer group at 3.2%. Second, we have $1 billion of liquidity as of December 31, providing us ample dry powder and strength.And third, our leverage metrics continue to improve. Debt to enterprise value was just 29% at quarter end, while net debt-to-EBITDAre was 5.6x, down nearly a full turn from 6.4x a year ago and a half turn better versus pre-COVID levels. We expect these metrics to improve further throughout 2023. Taken together, our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. Our liquidity position is strong, we remain selective in our capital deployment with balanced forward sources and uses and we continue to utilize a variety of capital allocation competitive advantages to create value and drive earnings accretion. With that, I will open it up for Q&amp;A.

439,b023ed6b-4cf2-39a4-87bb-66dd608a61ce,VNO,2023-02-10,Is a Beat in Store for Vornado (VNO) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beat-store-vornado-vno-earnings-155903486.html,1675958343,STORY,"['VNO', 'VNORP']","[Vornado Realty Trust VNO is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 13, before the opening bell. While the quarterly results are likely to exhibit revenue growth, funds from operations (FFO) per share might reflect a decline.In the last reported quarter, this New York-based real estate investment trust’s (REIT) FFO plus assumed conversions, as adjusted, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.46%. The quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated top-line growth. Healthy leasing activity was witnessed across all portfolios.Over the trailing four quarters, Vornado surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 6.98%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS SurpriseVornado Realty Trust Price and EPS SurpriseVornado Realty Trust price-eps-surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuotePer a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, the U.S. office market has been experiencing a decline in demand for office space, with overall office absorption negative in each quarter of 2022. Moreover, with remote and hybrid work systems, office space per office worker has been shrinking.The national vacancy rose 140 basis points year over year to 18.2%. The national asking rent was $37.38 for the fourth quarter. The overall gross leasing activity declined for two consecutive quarters after hitting 387 million square feet (msf) in second-quarter 2022. The same for the four quarters ending fourth-quarter 2022 was recorded at 339 msf.Nonetheless, per the Cushman &amp; Wakefield report, gross leasing for 2022 was 5% above the 20-year historical average, implying that the leasing market remains very active despite businesses continuing to downsize.Vornado’s portfolio of premium assets in a few select high-rent, high-barrier-to-entry markets of New York, San Francisco and Chicago is likely to have benefited from the flight-to-quality preference of office tenants. This is anticipated to have led to healthy leasing activity during the fourth quarter, which makes us optimistic about its results.A diversified tenant base, which includes several industry bellwethers, is expected to have led to stable cash flow generation during the quarter.Also, with consumers’ increased preference for in-person shopping experience, the retail real estate market is witnessing a rebound. This is likely to have aided the company’s Manhattan street retail performance during the to-be-reported quarter.VNO’s top line is expected to have improved amid these tailwinds. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $444.6 million, suggesting 5.6% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Further, Vornado expects around $600 million of non-cash impairment charges to reflect in its fourth-quarter 2022 results. Of this $600 million, roughly $480 million refers to the company’s common equity investment in the Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV (“Retail JV”).In 2020, Vornado recognized an impairment charge of $409 million. Together, these two impairment charges effectively reverse a portion of the $2.559 billion gain in relation to the 2019 required write-up for the seven properties it transferred to the Retail JV in April 2019.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been unchanged at 67 cents over the past month. The same suggests a 17.3% fall from the prior-year period’s reported number.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been unchanged at $3.10 over the past month. However, the figure indicates an 8.4% increase from the year-earlier reported figure on revenues of $1.80 billion.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for VNO this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. That’s just the case here.Earnings ESP: Vornado has an Earnings ESP of +6.13%.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Vornado Realty Trust is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for VNO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 71 cents per share for VNO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for VNO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +6.13% heading into earnings season.Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS SurpriseVornado Realty Trust price-eps-surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earning Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig, then we will turn it over to Tom, who will highlight the company's performance in the fourth quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation includes adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They're reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earning release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig.Craig Arnold: Thanks, Yan. We'll begin with the highlights of the quarter on Page 3. And I'll start by noting that we again delivered very strong results in the quarter and record performance for the year. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.06 for the quarter and $7.57 for the year, both all-time records in each period. Our Q4 adjusted EPS was up 20% from prior year. Our sales were $5.4 billion, up 15% organically and for the second quarter in a row with particular strength in utility, industrial, commercial institution, data center markets for electrical and commercial aerospace, vehicle and eMobility markets on the industrial side. And we continue to post strong margins. Q4 margins of 20.8% were up 150 basis points from prior year, near the high end of our guidance range.Story continuesAnd incremental margins were 33% in the quarter. For the full year, we delivered record segment margins of 20.2%, up 130 basis points from prior year. And as noted here, orders continue to remain very strong. On a rolling 12-month basis, Electrical orders were up 25% and Aerospace orders increased 24%, which led, quite frankly, to record backlogs as well, up 68% in Electrical and up 21% in Aerospace. Now lastly, in what was an otherwise challenging year, we generated record free cash flow in the quarter with adjusted free cash flow up 41%. And our free cash flow as a percentage of sales was 18.1% in the quarter. While improved cash flow in the second half of the year, it wasn't enough to really achieve the full year cash flow targets. As we indicated, we continue to prioritize supporting higher organic growth, winning new orders and protecting our customers, which all contributed to higher levels of working capital.But we still have work to do and with a focus on those areas that don't impact revenue growth. On Page 4, I summarize our performance highlights for last year. Overall, I'd say, in a challenging operating environment, our team delivered strong financial results. And as noted here, we exceeded three of our four key financial metrics. First, for organic revenue, we posted 13% growth, which was actually more than 60% above our original guidance at the midpoint. Throughout '22, we raised our organic revenue growth in all segments, and the team delivered on the organic growth expectations that we set. It's worth noting that our largest business, Electrical Americas, delivered 16% organic growth, 2x the midpoint of our original guidance. Second, I'd note that we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive profitable growth with record margins of 20.2% in 2022, which was 10 basis points above our original guidance at the midpoint.Third, adjusted EPS of $7.57 was $0.07 higher than the midpoint of our original guidance. And I'd note that we fully offset the impact of some $500 million of unfavorable currency or roughly $0.20 a share. Lastly, I'd note that we did miss our free cash flow guidance for the year. Most of this miss went into working capital to support higher levels of sales and orders and the record backlogs. But I'd say here, once again, I know we can do better. As you might expect, supply chain disruptions and our decision to prioritize protecting customers with higher inventory played a major role in this inventory growth over the year. But overall, I'd say it was a good year despite a year filled with inflation, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and FX headwinds, and the team delivered record financial results and we go into 2023 with positive momentum.So turning to Page 5. I hope at this point, you would agree that 2022 wasn't an exceptional year but just another year of delivering what we promised. And that it reflects the fundamental changes that we've made to the company over the last decade. We are a very different company today than we were 10 years ago. We've embraced the realities of a changing world and a necessity for us to change as well. We're now in attractive growth-oriented end markets, and we have a proven formula for how we run the company better through the Eaton Business System. With this transformation, we've become a stronger company that has delivered higher growth, higher margins and better earnings consistency. And we continue to be a good steward of your capital. The end result is the new Eaton where some 90% of our profits now come from Electrical and Aerospace businesses.But once again, when I'm done, we'll continue to apply our operational model, our strategic framework and our potential criteria, and we'd expect to continue to maximize value to all of our stakeholders. And as you can see on Page 6, what this transformation has delivered to our shareholders. As you would expect, our strong results have translated into very strong financial results. And for the sake of comparison, we charted total shareholder returns for 3, 5 and 7 years. And we've compared our results with the S&amp;P 500, the medium of our peer group and the XLI Industrial Index. And in every case, Eaton has significantly outperformed our benchmarks. And as I'll explain in the next few slides, we do believe our best days are still in front of us.Turning to Page 7. Our transformation into a global intelligent power management company has positioned Eaton at the center of some of -- what we think are some of the most important trends that we'll see in our lifetime. The most significant being climate change and all the downstream implications that it brings. As we all know, climate change is driving the need to transition from fossil fuels to renewables, and increased regulations are driving the demand for new solutions. These solutions will require tremendous investments in renewables and grid infrastructure for both new and existing buildings. This trend is also closely coupled to need to electrify the economy. Cars, trucks, planes, buildings are all requiring more electrical content.And as we move away from fossil fuels, this allows us to take advantage of renewables. And digitalization is providing us access to data and insights that are allowing us to be more connected, more productive and more efficient than ever. It's also, by the way, creating a need for more data centers, an important end market for Eaton. Additive to these trends, we're also on the front end of an aerospace recovery cycle that will drive growth in both our commercial and military markets. I don't know about you, but I can tell you, I don't -- I can't think of a company with a better set of market dynamics than Eaton. And while we're not ready to change our long-term growth goals, I'd be surprised if we didn't exceed our previously announced targets of 5% to 8% annual growth.Next, on Page 8, we highlight how these megatrends are supported by unprecedented government stimulus spending really around the world. In fact, these programs will have a direct impact on the growth rate of more than half of our end markets. And in the U.S. alone, the Infrastructure Act from 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act from 2022 will fund some $450 billion of grid modernization and other climate-related programs. And of particular importance to Eaton is the $88 billion that are set aside for power grid updates and EV charging networks and incentives. In Europe, the EU recovery plan recovers -- provides, excuse me, $244 billion of green energy transition, which member states are now working on implementing. And in China, the government has set clear goals to lower carbon emissions.They've laid out plans to strengthen their grid by 2025, including investments in more wind and solar. China also continues to lead the world in the adoption of electric vehicles. But even if you exclude China, we still estimate that between the U.S. and EU programs will expand Eaton's addressable market by some $11 billion to $14 billion over the next 5 years. And I'd say this is just another powerful tailwind that supports our confidence in the growth outlook of the company. Tom will pick it up here and take you through the numbers.Tom Okray: Thanks, Craig. On Page 9, I'll begin with highlighting a few key points regarding our Q4 results. Revenue was up 12% with organic growth of 15%, partially offset by a 4% foreign exchange headwind and a 1% favorable net impact from acquisitions. This outcome illustrates our focus of prioritizing growth in our customers. With total revenue growth of 12%, we posted solid operating leverage. Operating profit grew 21% and adjusted EPS grew 20%. Further, excluding the $0.05 impact from foreign exchange, growth in adjusted EPS would have been 23%. All in, strong organic growth and margins enabled us to report all-time record adjusted earnings of $825 million and adjusted EPS of $2.06, which was above our guidance midpoint.Lastly, I'd like to note that we continue to raise the bar with our Q4 records for both segment operating margin and segment operating profit. Moving on to the next chart, we summarized strong financial performance for our Electrical Americas business. For yet another quarter, we have set all-time records for sales, operating profit and margin. Further, we've also set all-time records for these metrics for the full year. Organic sales growth accelerated from 18% in Q3 to 20% in Q4 with robust growth in every end market and particular strength in utility, data center and commercial and institutional markets. Operating margin of 23.7% was up 450 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher volumes. In addition, incremental margins were quite strong at 47%.We continue to manage price effectively to more than offset inflationary pressures. Further, it should be noted that Electrical Americas outperformed their original 2020 guidance by 100 basis points. Orders in backlog continued to be very strong. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 34%, which remains at a high level with strong growth across the board and particular strength in data center, utility and industrial markets. Backlog ended the year up 87% versus prior year and increased sequentially from Q3. In addition to the robust trends and orders in backlog, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q4 was up nearly 100% versus prior year from especially strong growth in manufacturing, data center, industrial and utility end markets.Overall, Electrical Americas had a strong quarter to round out a very good year and continues to be well positioned as we start 2023. Moving to Page 11, we show results for our Electrical Global segment, which produced another strong quarter, including records for Q4 and full year records for sales, operating profit and margins. Organic growth was up 8%, which was entirely offset by headwinds from foreign exchange of 7% and divestiture of 1%. With respect to organic growth, we saw strength in utility, industrial and data center end markets. On a regional basis, we posted high single-digit organic growth in IEMEA and mid-single-digit organic growth in APAC. Operating margin of 18.7% was down 80 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to foreign exchange headwinds.We continue to see good order intake. Orders were up 11% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center and commercial and institutional markets. Backlog growth of 17% also remains strong. Before moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segments. For Q4, we posted organic growth of 15%, incremental margins of 44% and operating margin of 21.8%, which was 250 basis points of year-over-year margin improvement. For the full year, our Electrical segments grew 15% organically, generated 33% incremental margin, increased margin 140 basis points, posted 25% rolling 12 months order growth and increased backlog 68%. We are confident that we're well positioned for continued growth with strong margins in our overall Electrical business.The next chart recaps our Aerospace segment. We posted all-time record sales and operating profit for both the quarter and on a full year basis. Organic growth accelerated to 11% with a 4% headwind from foreign exchange. This growth was driven by strength in commercial markets with commercial aftermarket up 35% and commercial OEM up more than 20%. Relative to profit, operating margin was strong at 24.5%. And it's worth noting that Aerospace outperformed their original 2020 guidance by 100 basis points. Order growth and backlog are very encouraging. On a rolling 12-month basis, order acceleration continued, up 24% compared to 22% in Q3 and 19% in Q2 with strength across all end markets. Similar to Q3, we saw especially strong growth in military OEM orders, up 80% in the quarter, which positions us well for growth in 2023 and confirms our expectations for increased defense spending, including breakout performance in 2024.Factory, IndustrialPhoto by Remy Gieling on UnsplashYear-over-year backlog increased from 17% in Q3 to up 21% in Q4. Moving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 13. Vehicle had strong revenue growth in the second half of the year. In Q4, revenue was up 16% with 18% organic growth and 2% unfavorable foreign exchange. This coming off 19% organic growth in Q3. We saw growth across all markets with particular strength in North America and South America light vehicle. We also saw double-digit growth in APAC. Operating margins came in at 15.2% with unfavorability to prior year, primarily due to manufacturing inefficiencies. As expected, we were able to completely offset the impact of inflation with pricing in Q4. We also secured wins in new and sustainable technologies, such as EV gearing and transmissions, with a large and growing opportunity pipeline.On Page 14, we show results for our eMobility business. We generated very strong growth in the quarter. Revenue was up 58%, including 17% from organic growth and 44% from the acquisition of Royal Power, partially offset by 3% negative foreign exchange. Margin improved 780 basis points versus prior year driven by higher volumes and the impact from Royal Power. We remain encouraged by the growth prospects of the eMobility segment. Since 2018, we've won $1.4 billion of mature year revenues in this business, including a recent $400 million win for power protection and distribution units with a European customer. This is a major new program win in both U.S. and European markets with production starting in 2024. This win demonstrates Eaton's ability to leverage our capabilities across our entire portfolio, including core technology in both electrical and industrial businesses.We partnered with our customer to electrify their mobile platform with solutions, including Breaktor and Bussmann fuses. We also leverage our extensive vehicle expertise and added content from our Royal Power acquisition. Overall, we continue to make progress toward our long-term goal to create a $2 billion to $4 billion business with 15% margins by 2030. We are now on track to exceed our expectation to deliver $1.2 billion of revenue and 11% margin by 2025. Moving to Page 15. I'm going to unpack a theme that Craig mentioned at the top of the call related to our strategic investments in working capital to support strong orders and backlog, which enables accelerated organic growth. Overall, in spite of supporting surging orders and backlog, we are driving working capital improvements.To illustrate the trend, I'll provide a couple of examples. Net working capital to orders and inventory as a percentage of backlog. Focusing on the left side of the chart, the average value of our Electrical and Aerospace quarterly orders in 2022 was more than 20% higher than 2021 and 33% more than 2019. However, to support these increasing orders, we have only slightly increased the absolute value of our working capital. The result is shown in the graph on the left side of the page. Our ratio of net working capital at year-end to trailing 12-month orders has stepped down significantly from 2019 to 2022. Moving to the right side of the chart. Another way to look at working capital efficiency is comparing backlog growth to inventory growth. At the end of 2022, our Electrical and Aerospace backlog reached approximately $11 billion, which is up almost 160% since the end of 2019.However, to support this much larger backlog, inventory for our Electrical and Aerospace businesses has only increased by 38% since 2019. The graph on the right side of the slide highlights the significant improvement since 2019. Our inventory as a percentage of backlog has been roughly cut in half from the end of 2019 to the end of 2022. We are supporting a much larger backlog with a smaller percentage of inventory. In summary, we have prudently prioritized taking care of our customers and capturing growth, which has required investments in working capital and has impacted free cash flow metrics in the short term. That said, we are managing working capital more efficiently. The 2023 guidance on Page 16 shows that we are well positioned for another strong year of financial performance.Our organic growth guidance for 2023 is a range of 7% to 9% with particular strength in Electrical Americas and Aerospace with organic growth rates of 8% to 10%. eMobility is also a standout with 35% organic growth guidance at the midpoint tied to the ramp of new programs. These organic growth rates correspond to our end-market growth assumptions that we provided on our Q3 earnings call and that Craig will update in a few slides. The end-market growth, combined with increased backlog, provides tremendous visibility and confidence in our 2023 outlook. For segment margins, our guidance range of 20.7% and 21.1% is a 70-basis points improvement at the midpoint from our 2022 all-time record margin of 20.2%. In addition to projecting strong organic growth for 2023, we're also growing margins and continue to invest in future organic growth.Moving to Page 17. We have the balance of our guidance for 2023 and Q1. I'll touch on some highlights. For 2023, we are guiding adjusted EPS in the range of $8.04 to $8.44, which has a midpoint of $8.24 is 9% growth over 2022. We expect continued foreign exchange headwinds, which we estimate between $100 million and $200 million adverse. For operating cash flow, our guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion is a 34% increase at the midpoint over 2022. The key drivers here are a combination of higher earnings and improved working capital, particularly lower inventory levels as supply chains normalize. While our plan includes significant improvement in free cash flow during 2023, I'll note that we anticipate due to higher interest expense and CapEx in Q1 as well as timing-related headwinds such as taxes that free cash flow in Q1 will be relatively flat year-over-year.For share repurchases, we anticipate a range of $300 million to $600 million. Moving to Q1. For Q1, we are guiding organic growth of 8% to 10%, segment margins between 19.5% and 19.9%, and adjusted EPS in a range of $1.72 to $1.82. Now I'll hand it back to Craig to walk us through the market outlook and wrap up the presentation.Craig Arnold: Thanks, Tom. Turning to Page 18, we provide a look at our current market assumptions for the year. This chart has been updated from what we shared in our Q3 earnings call, but we really don't see any material changes here. I'll remind you that we do expect a mild recession in 2023. But given the secular growth trends that we've talked about, our strong orders and healthy backlog, we would expect to see growth in most of our end markets with six of our end markets representing some 70% of the company up nicely. And these markets are also, by the way, supported by a very strong negotiation pipeline. Of note, we now expect even stronger growth within our commercial and institutional segment given the relatively strong orders growth in the quarter and the continued strength in Dodge nonresidential construction contracts.The only down market is expected to be residential, which only accounts for 8% of our revenue. In total, we're encouraged to report that 85% of our markets are expected to see positive growth in 2023. And lastly, let me close on Page 19 just with a few summary comments. First, I'd say our thesis for Eaton as a changed company has continued to pay even better than we expected. Second, the growth trends, the right investments have delivered better top line growth, and we continue to run the company better. We delivered 13% organic growth with record orders and backlog. And despite supply chain challenges, an inflationary environment and significant FX headwinds, 2022 was a year of record profits, record margins, record adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS.And I'm particularly encouraged by our 20% increase in adjusted EPS growth in Q4, which I see as a positive indicator for 2023. So despite the macro concerns, we expect 2023 to be another very strong year. And the company is on track and likely ahead of schedule for delivering our 2025 goals for revenue, margins, free cash flow and adjusted EPS. So I'll stop here and open things up for any questions that you may have.Yan Jin: Thanks, Craig. . Thanks in advance for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the guidance.See also 10 Hot Insurance Stocks To Buy Now and 15 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The S&amp;P 500 is already up 8.6% YTD, its strongest start in 21 years.Well known stock market leaders such as Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, and Meta Platforms META have participated in the rally. But a surprising group is really leading the charge. The best performing stocks of the year so far have been those with the largest short positions.Some of the top performers have been Carvana CVNA, the online car dealership up 178% YTD, the online furniture shop Wayfair W, up 93%, and electric vehicle company Lucid Group LCID up 70%.What is Happening?Many hedge funds who built huge short positions in these stocks during 2022 have been caught off guard by this big rally. While their thesis about these companies are likely correct, it seems many overstayed their welcome and have been forced to cover their levered short positions.Some players were also clearly late to the game in shorting. Shorting a company near its top is going to be much less risky than shorting it when the stock is already down 60% or 70%, even if it is eventually going to zero.Carvana in particular is a broken business model, low on profit, and high on stock-based compensation. CVNA is up nearly 200% on the year, but still down -95% off its high.The path to zero for these stocks isn’t a straight line, and the larger the short float gets the more vulnerable they become to short squeezes, and that is exactly what happened.“What do you call a stock that's down 90%? A stock that was down 80% and then got cut in half.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImplicationsWhat does this mean for the broad market?If the stocks that are leading the rally are those with broken business models, and no clear path to profitability does that seem positive?In some ways it’s simply a mechanical unwinding of poorly positioned participants. They managed their risk poorly, and the market is bringing the pain.Story continuesOn the other side, it may make some participants skeptical. It isn’t particularly reassuring if the companies leading the rally are the types of stocks that pumped during the euphoric period in 2021.Buy This Not ThatAs exhilarating as trading one of these high-flyers may be, it is highly advisable to avoid such stocks. Sure some hedge funds got burned in the last month staying short, but these are the most shorted stocks in the market for a reason.Plenty of quality stocks with proven business models are trading higher in this strong market. Meta Platforms is looking like it may have found its footing in this market. After getting crushed last year in the wake of “Metaverse” investments, the company has refocused, and sentiment around the company has reversed.META also currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating its positive trending earnings revisions. Although at this point investors missed the opportunity to buy META shares at a one year forward P/E below 10, it is still somewhat reasonably valued at 20x forward earnings today.Another stock with positive developments is Aflac AFL, the supplemental health and life insurance company. Insurance may not be the most exciting industry to, boring is often conducive to good investing.Aflac is a steady earner, with strong long-term returns and a 2.4% dividend yield to boot.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurthermore, Zack’s research currently has AFL as a top recommendation, with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). AFL is receiving consistent positive earnings revisions from analysts across all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionThe market is going through some very interesting times. It’s not often you see failing companies rallying 100% in a month. Thankfully, the good businesses are rallying too.It seems that the macroeconomic environment that challenged the stock market in 2022 is turning, and that is good news for the economy and market. If the Federal Reserve can stay the course, conquer inflation, and eventually bring interest rates back to an accommodative level the market can continue its long-term march higher.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The figure also compares unfavorably with the year-ago quarter’s 39 cents.Though Kimco reported growth in revenues, a rise in interest expenses acted as a dampener. This retail REIT provided an initial outlook for 2023, which is below the consensus mark.This retail REIT clocked in revenues of $439.8 million, beating the consensus mark of $435.2 million. Quarterly revenues increased 3.6% year over year.For the full-year 2022, Kimco’s FFO per share came in at $1.58, higher than the prior-year tally of $1.38 and in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This was backed by 26.6% growth in revenues to $1.73 billion.Quarter in DetailPro-rata portfolio occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 95.7%, reflecting an expansion of 130 basis points (bps) year over year and 40 bps sequentially. Pro-rata anchor occupancy was 98.0%, up 90 bps year over year and 20 bps from the previous quarter. Pro-rata small-shop occupancy ended the quarter at 90.0%, representing an uptick of 230 bps from the prior-year quarter and 80 bps from the prior quarter.The company signed 492 leases aggregating 2.5 million square feet in the quarter. Kimco generated blended pro-rata rent spreads on comparable spaces of 8.7%, with rental rates for new leases up 30.4%, and renewals and options rising 4.6%.Same-property net operating income (NOI) increased 1.9% year over year, backed by a rise of 3.9% in the minimum rent. Interest expenses were up 6% year over year to $60.9 million in the reported quarter.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Kimco acquired a grocery-anchored portfolio of eight Long Island, NY shopping centers in infill, high barrier to entry markets encompassing 540,000 square feet of space for $375.8 million. Moreover, Kimco acquired three land interests for $12.5 million.During the quarter, Kimco sold two shopping centers and four land parcels aggregating 439,000 square feet for $41.9 million. Kimco’s pro-rata share of the sales price was $27.9 million.Story continuesBalance Sheet PositionThis retail REIT exited 2022 with more than $2.1 billion of immediate liquidity. This included full availability under its $2-billion unsecured revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents of $150 million. Kimco generated proceeds of $301.1 million from the sale of 11.5 million shares of Albertsons Companies, Inc. ACI common stock.Following the quarter end, Kimco received $194.1 million as a special dividend payment from ACI related to the remaining 28.3 million ACI shares owned. Its net-debt-to-EBITDA on a look-through basis was 6.4X at the end of the fourth quarter, slightly up from 6.3X year over year.Dividend UpdateConcurrent with the fourth-quarter earnings release, Kimco’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 23 cents per share. This dividend will be paid out on Mar 23 to its shareholders on record as of Mar 9, 2023.2023 GuidanceFor 2023, Kimco projects FFO per share in the range of $1.53-$1.57.

451,24421f67-263b-354c-8d76-7235ac482162,AWK,2023-02-10,SJW (SJW) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sjw-sjw-earnings-expected-grow-150003614.html,1675954803,STORY,"['SJW', 'AWK']","[The market expects SJW (SJW) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent of San Jose Water Co. Is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +145.2%.Revenues are expected to be $156 million, up 11.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for SJW?For SJW, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.97%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that SJW will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that SJW would post earnings of $0.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.83, delivering a surprise of +23.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.SJW appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry, American Water Works (AWK) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -10.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $884.07 million, down 7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for American Water Works has been revised 7.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.66%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that American Water Works will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With that being said, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi are viable consumer staples investments, and monitoring their growth and valuation mostly differentiates which company may be more suitable in investors’ portfolios.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsi Q4 ReviewThere could be increased optimism about Coca-Cola stock prior to earnings, largely due to Pepsi’s Q4 report that saw the company beat on its top and bottom line. Pepsi posted quarterly EPS of $1.67 a share topping estimates by 1.82%. Sales came in at $28 billion, which was a 4% surprise.Year over year, Q4 earnings were up 9% with sales up 11% from the prior-year quarter. This was despite Pepsi seeing lower sales volume, contrary to net sales increasing. Specifically, among Pepsi’s Quaker Foods North America, sales volume fell 7%.Pepsi’s net income was also down to $518 million compared to $1.32 billion in Q4 2021. Still, the company did see stronger demand for Pepsi Zero Sugar, with sales volume up 26% as the product looks to rival Coke Zero.Coca-Cola Q4 Preview Looking at Coca-Cola, Q4 earnings are projected at $0.45 per share, which would be on par with Q4 2021. Sales for the quarter are expected to be $10.01 billion, up 6% from the prior year quarter. Story continuesThis would round out Coca-Cola’s Fiscal 2022 with earnings up 7% to $2.48 a share. On the top line, sales would be up 11% for FY22 to $42.86 billion compared to $38.66 billion in 2021.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; Outlook  After wrapping up fiscal 2022, Coca-Cola’s FY23 earnings are forecasted to rise 3% to $2.55 per share with earnings estimate revisions slightly higher over the last quarter. Sales are projected to be up 3% to $44.22 billion. More impressive, Fiscal 2023 would represent 38% growth over the last five years with 2018 sales at $31.85 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn comparison, Pepsi’s earnings are expected to jump 7% in FY23 at $7.25 per share with earnings estimates remaining unchanged. Sales are forecasted to rise 3% in FY23 to $88.27 billion. Fiscal 2023 sales would be a 36% increase from five years ago, with 2018 sales at $64.66 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; Valuation Over the last year, Coca-Cola stock is down -3% to underperform Pepsi’s +3% but both have topped the S&amp;P 500’s -10%. In the last decade, Pepsi’s +213% total return which includes dividends has also topped Coca-Cola’s +118% but trailed the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe valuation of both Coca-Cola and Pepsi stock is very similar. Coca-Cola stock trades just under $60 a share and 23.4X forward earnings which is roughly on par with the industry average. This is 18% below its decade high of 28.5X and just above the median of 22.9X.Pivoting to Pepsi, shares of PEP trade at $172 per share and 23.6X forward earnings. This is 15% below its decade long high of 27.8X and 7% above the median of 21.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividends In regards to passive income, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi are Dividend Kings raising their payout for more than 50 consecutive years. To that note, Coca-Cola’s 2.95% dividend yield and annual increases (60 years) top Pepsi at the moment although the latter recently announced it will increase its dividend by 10% along with $1 billion worth of buybacks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway Leading up to its earnings next week, Coca-Cola stock currently sports a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) with Pepsi landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This is mostly attributed to Coca-Cola’s earnings estimates trending higher for fiscal 2023 while Pepsi’s FY23 estimates have remained unchanged although analysts haven’t had the time to offer updates after the company's Q4 report.Furthermore, Pepsi’s solid Q4 report may very well be an indication that Coca-Cola may give a positive quarterly report as well. Coca-Cola could also boost its dividend and offer buybacks to support shareholders. Ultimately, KO stock may be a more intriguing investment than PEP even though their fundamentals are very similar but Coca-Cola shares come with a more affordable price tag.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:19% = US$4.3b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.19 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 19% ROEAt first glance, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 23%. This certainly adds some context to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' exceptional 32% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 26%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for REGN? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

REGN announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of ophthalmology drug Eylea (aflibercept).Eylea injection has been approved for the treatment of preterm infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).The FDA’s approval is supported by data from two randomized global phase III studies – FIREFLEYE (n=113) and BUTTERFLEYE (n=120) – evaluating Eylea 0.4 mg versus laser photocoagulation (laser) in infants with ROP.Data from both trials showed that approximately 80% of Eylea-treated infants achieved an absence of both active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes at 52 weeks of age, which is better than would have been expected without treatment.Both trials were conducted pursuant to FDA Pediatric Written Request. In October 2022, the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity to Eylea, which extends the period of U.S. market exclusivity of the drug by an additional six months through May 17, 2024.Eylea is now indicated to treat five retinal conditions caused by ocular angiogenesis following the first pediatric approval.The drug is approved for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and ROP.Regeneron is developing Eylea in collaboration with Bayer BAYRY.Regeneron sponsored BUTTERFLEYE, while Bayer sponsored FIREFLEYE.Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States and Bayer records net product sales of Eylea outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Regeneron’s shares have gained 20.1% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 12.8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results even though Eylea sales declined.Meanwhile, the primary endpoints were achieved in two trials investigating aflibercept 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens in patients with DME and wet AMD. The PHOTON trial in DME and the PULSAR trial in wet AMD both demonstrated that aflibercept 8 mg 12- and 16-week dosing regimens achieved non-inferiority in vision gains compared to the Eylea 8-week dosing regimen.Story continuesA biologics license application (BLA) for the treatment of wet AMD and DME was submitted to the FDA in December 2022.Meanwhile, shares of Bayer rallied after the company appointed Bill Anderson as its CEO. Anderson had recently served as CEO of Roche’s Pharmaceuticals Division.Zacks Rank and Key PicksRegeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Other pipeline and regulatory updates were also in focus.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:Q4 Earnings by AMGN, BMY, GILD, REGN:  Amgen AMGN reported strong fourth-quarter results, topping earnings and sales estimates. However, the outlook for 2023 disappointed investors. Key products like Repatha, Prolia and Evenity posted solid growth.Bristol Myers BMY reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenues of $11.4 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.1 billion but decreased 5% from the year-ago period due to generic competition for multiple myeloma (MM) drug, Revlimid, and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by in-line products (primarily Opdivo) and new product portfolios (primarily Opdualag and Abecma). The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.82, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.71 but was down from the $1.84 reported in the year-ago quarter.Gilead Sciences GILD reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results due to continued solid demand for its HIV portfolio with further share growth for flagship therapy Biktarvy and oncology revenues driven by the cell therapy franchise and Trodelvy. The company reported earnings of $1.67 per share in the quarter, which easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50. Total revenues of $7.4 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.6 billion.Regeneron REGN posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results even though Eylea sales were hurt by a short-term shift to off-label use of Avastin (bevacizumab), a temporary closing in the fourth quarter of a not-for-profit fund that provides patient co-pay assistance and an increase in sales-related deductions. Fourth-quarter earnings of $12.56 per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.68.  Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent, which maintained its stellar performance.Story continuesGilead Gets FDA Nod for Trodelvy:  Gilead obtained FDA approval for Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH–) breast cancer who have received endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies in the metastatic setting. The approval is based on statistically significant and clinically meaningful progression-free survival and overall survival data from the phase III TROPiCS-02 study. The drug is already approved for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, at least one of them for metastatic disease.Label Expansion of Regeneron’s Eylea:  Regeneron announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of the ophthalmology drug Eylea (aflibercept) for treating preterm infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).The FDA approval is supported by data from two randomized, global phase III studies – FIREFLEYE (n=113) and BUTTERFLEYE (n=120) – evaluating Eylea 0.4 mg versus laser photocoagulation (laser) in infants with ROP.

KPRX surged after it announced that it received investigational new drug application approval for a mid-stage study of KIO-101 for the treatment of the Ocular Presentation of Rheumatoid Arthritis and other autoimmune diseases (OPRA+). KIO-101 is part of a class of non-steroidal autoimmune disease drugs called DHODH inhibitors, which reduce T-cell proliferation and ongoing proinflammatory cytokine release. The phase II study will enroll approximately 120 patients in a multi-center, controlled, randomized, double-masked trial assessing the safety and efficacy of KIO-101 eye drops in patients with autoimmune disease who have signs and symptoms of the ocular surface disease. The study is expected to begin enrolling patients in Australia in the first half of 2023.The study will evaluate two concentrations of KIO-101, 0.15% and 0.30%. The efficacy endpoints will evaluate a number of established ocular signs and symptoms, including but not limited to corneal staining and changes in Schirmer's test score at 12 weeks.

465,b0b4d27c-5af0-30bb-a580-13bca1ca527e,UNP,2023-02-10,The five-year decline in earnings might be taking its toll on Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) shareholders as stock falls 3.6% over the past week,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-decline-earnings-might-taking-120058735.html,1676030458,STORY,['UNP'],"[The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) share price is up 51% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 15% in the last year.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Union Pacific's earnings per share are down 4.1% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The revenue growth of 0.9% per year hardly seems impressive. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthUnion Pacific is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Union Pacific in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Union Pacific, it has a TSR of 68% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Union Pacific shareholders are down 13% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 8.4%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Union Pacific better, we need to consider many other factors.

The calls were made to check in on the progress made so far and remind the railroads the White House expects the companies will do more for their workers, a second White House official said.CSX announced on Tuesday that it had reached a deal with two railroad unions regarding paid sick leave, the sticking point in last year's contract dispute between 12 rail unions and U.S. freight railroads.The deal is a ""good step"" and in part a result of continued engagement from the administration, the second White House official said.Asked whether the White House played a role, CSX said on Thursday it appreciates the ""administration's engagement on this matter"" and that it will continue to pursue agreements with the remaining 10 unions. Union Pacific, BNSF and Norfolk Southern do not currently offer workers paid sick leave.On Dec. 2, Biden signed legislation to block a railroad strike that could have wrecked the nation's economy, upsetting unions that had been negotiating for months. At the time, Biden pledged to secure paid sick leave for American workers ""before it's all over.""Railroads have slashed labor and other costs to bolster profits in recent years, and have been fiercely opposed to adding paid sick time that would require them to hire more staff.After Biden signed the bill in December, rail unions said they are discussing an executive action with the White House on paid sick time.Celeste Drake, deputy director of the White House's National Economic Council, told Reuters in a statement the administration has continued to evaluate ""all legislative and administrative options"" on the issue.

468,3a4755ff-7c4b-31a4-8c8c-5cbbc002bcea,UNP,2023-02-10,3 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Rebounding Economy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-industrial-stocks-buy-rebounding-202605908.html,1675715165,STORY,"['LMT', 'UNP', 'D']","[With a robust job market, declining inflation, and slowing interest rate hikes, investors are again searching for industrial stocks to buy. Most industrial stocks are often on the cyclical spectrum but have proved resilient. Moreover, with the market outlook being sunny for the past few weeks, many investors are taking that as a sign that we have indeed bottomed.If you look at the bigger picture, things are looking very good. Take the price of natural gas, for example; it is down a remarkable 75% from Aug., while crude oil also drops — albeit at a slower rate. Energy is just the tip of the iceberg when we are looking at a broad decline in commodity prices, which will considerably impact inflation readings.Naturally, there is still uncertainty about where the economy is heading in the long run. We may even see deflation, and there is no guarantee of a soft landing yet, considering inverted bond yields and leading economic indicators still indicating risk. Furthermore, if commodities slip too far, that would suggest that demand is weak, negatively influencing the stock market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNavigating both the bullish and bearish arguments is complex, but I believe the stock market will continue a near-term uptrend until more investors take notice of tumbling inflation and commodity prices. Whatever it may be, there are still businesses that can benefit from a bullish outlook while maintaining a level of resistance to future recessionary pressures. The following three are such industrial stocks to buy as the economy turns a corner:LMTLockheed Martin$464.39UNPUnion Pacific$209.11DDominion Energy$61.14Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comDefense companies have played a vital role in ensuring transatlantic and Asia-Pacific security through deterrence. In fact, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, companies like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) are becoming increasingly important.Story continuesThis company designs and manufactures aerospace hardware detrimental to U.S. and European security. Lockheed Martin’s cutting-edge fighter jets, such as the F-35 and F-22, transport planes, missiles, and sensors are on the top priority list of what governments worldwide are looking to buy in the next few years after the Ukraine war.NATO as a whole is increasing its defense budget, while allies such as Japan and Australia are also boosting their budgets by a significant margin. Most of this will go to the air force, especially considering Japan, the U.K., Australia, and Taiwan are island nations. With that in mind, Lockheed Martin is set to be among the largest beneficiaries of this trend.Furthermore, there are rumors of Ukrainian pilots already being trained on the F-16 aircraft, and I believe it is only a matter of time before Ukraine starts to receive them despite near-term hesitancy. This will only add to Lockheed Martin’s prominence. Therefore, I see Lockheed Martin as among the top industrial stocks to buy. Even if a recession hits, the company will have solid product demand and excellent future growth prospects.Union Pacific (UNP)A photo of train tracks leading toward a sunset.Source: Liz Kcer/ShutterStock.comUnion Pacific’s (NYSE:UNP) revenue has been driven by robust demand for rail transportation services, particularly in industrial products, agricultural products, and intermodal containers. The top line grew near an 8% clip in Q4 2022, and I expect the stock to deliver great long-term returns regardless of economic conditions if you buy right now.UNP stock is already down 23% from its peak, providing a compelling entry point with little downside risk. Furthermore, the U.S. is heavily investing in its infrastructure, and freight train operators are notable beneficiaries of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.Additionally, Union Pacific is aggressively buying back shares, which gives it a significant advantage over other industrial stocks to buy. It also has a dividend yield of 2.47%, which should generate substantial returns combined with its stock price performance, especially at this entry point. In conclusion, Union Pacific is a well-established and well-regarded transportation company. Its stock has been performing well, and the company has a strong track record of delivering shareholder value. It should have significant upside potential while maintaining inelastic demand in case of a downturn.Dominion Energy (D)a truck bearing the Dominion Energy logoSource: ying / Shutterstock.comDominion Energy (NYSE:D) is one of the largest producers and transporters of energy in the United States, with a portfolio that includes natural gas, electricity, and renewable energy sources. The company has a long history of steady growth and profitability and has been a popular choice among income-seeking investors for its consistently high dividend payouts.Although I wouldn’t recommend an energy company when natural gas and oil prices fall, the current value of this stock looks too favorable to ignore. Its recent decline of 30% from its peak makes it the perfect time to open up a long-term position — Dominion’s 4.43% dividend yield is an additional sweetener. Sure, it’s not the flashiest of picks, but I believe its transition to renewable energy and the demographic advantage that my colleague Josh Enomoto pointed out in his article, make it a solid long-term bet among the industrial stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Don't Ignore These 2 Computer and Technology Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-140002488.html,1675951202,STORY,"['CSCO', 'ORCL']","[Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Oracle (ORCL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.23 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on March 9, 2023.ORCL has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.15%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19.ORCL is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Cisco Systems is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 15, 2023. CSCO's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.87 a share six days from its next earnings release.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cisco Systems is $0.86, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.66%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ORCL and CSCO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.
