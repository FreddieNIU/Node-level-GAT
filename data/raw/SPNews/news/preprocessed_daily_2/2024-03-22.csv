The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Nucor's shares before the 27th of March in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 10th of May."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.54 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.16 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Nucor has a trailing yield of 1.1% on the current stock price of US$196.38. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Nucor's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Nucor ', 'Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Nucor is paying out just 11% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Nucor generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend.

This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Nucor has grown its earnings rapidly, up 20% a year for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, Nucor looks like a promising growth company."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Nucor has lifted its dividend by approximately 3.9% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth."", ""Has Nucor got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that Nucor is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Nucor, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it."", ""In light of that, while Nucor has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock.

Although the sector lagged behind others like technology and communication services, there were opportunities for significant growth. As per BlackRock’s latest report, within the pharmaceutical sub-sector, performance varied widely. Notably, GLP-1 drugs emerged as effective weight loss treatments, boosting leading developers Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). However, many companies struggled due to tough year-over-year comparisons after revenue from vaccines and therapeutics surged past $100 billion in 2022 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In the medical device and supplies sector, easing supply constraints and a return to elective procedures led to 7% returns by August 1, 2023. However, an announcement by Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) regarding cardiovascular benefits in their GLP-1 SELECT trial triggered a sell-off, erasing gains and resulting in negative returns for the sub-sector. Biotechnology faced continued pressure as interest rates rose, with several indices nearing multi-year lows. Providers and services also felt the impact of COVID-19 aftershocks, with utilization trends and rising medical costs remaining concerns. However, distributors saw improvements in fundamentals and the resolution of opioid litigation issues.', 'The global healthcare sector faces another year of significant change and challenges in 2024. Providers worldwide are grappling with ongoing labor shortages and rising costs stemming from the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is optimism fueled by the broader adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence, which hold promise in addressing some of these issues. Despite this, the ongoing existence of health disparities poses additional challenges and financial burdens for the healthcare sector in 2024. If not adequately tackled, Deloitte forecasts that these inequities could lead to a threefold increase in costs, reaching $1 trillion by 2040, equating to roughly US$3,000 annually per individual.', 'On a positive note, the integration of AI and machine learning technologies offers potential solutions to these disparities, provided providers address trust and bias issues. Moreover, the pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote technologies and telemedicine, transforming the delivery and nature of healthcare. Providers are extending care beyond traditional medical services to include holistic social care, recognizing the profound impact of social determinants on overall well-being. Consequently, there is a push to integrate social care into public health systems to address multifaceted patient needs. Moreover, addressing the escalating costs of healthcare remains a priority globally, with efforts focused on controlling costs while maintaining quality and accessibility. Strategies such as value-based care models and innovative pricing structures aim to ensure cost-effective healthcare delivery.', 'According to KPMG, on the pharmaceutical side, notable policy shifts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Biden administration posed challenges alongside innovations in precision medicine. Diagnostics saw a decline in domestic mergers and acquisitions, with significant transactions involving international entities. Conversely, the medical devices sector anticipates recovery following a resurgence in elective surgeries and advancements in areas like cardiology and robotic surgery. Biopharma services continue to adapt post-COVID-19, with demand fluctuating and competition intensifying. Hospitals and health systems are focusing on efficiency and revenue enhancement through automation and strategic partnerships. Physician practices witnessed increased interest from strategic buyers, particularly in the latter half of 2023, amidst reimbursement pressures and regulatory changes. Lastly, healthcare IT, though fragmented, is witnessing a shift towards digital transformation, driving potential deal activity.', 'Some of the best healthcare stocks to buy include Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis, you can directly go to the 5 Countries with the Most Climate Refugees in the World.\xa0', 'UNHCR reported that of all the internal displacements that took place in 2022, more than half were triggered by climate-related disasters. As the link between climate risk and human displacement grows, there’s a widespread concern that the phenomenon might trigger massive migrations from the Global South to the Global North. However, UNHCR states that the majority of the people forced to move due to climate risk tend to shift within their own countries. The IDMC Global Report on Internal Displacement mentioned that climate-related disasters triggered 32.6 million internal displacements in 2022. Furthermore, UNHCR reported that 70% of all refugees shift to neighboring countries in an attempt to stay close to family, so affected individuals are less likely to move longer distances. Because most climate displacements happen within the state borders, ‘climate refugee’ is not a term officially recognized by international law.\xa0', 'According to the IDMC Global Report, a total of 71.1 million people were living in internal displacement when 2022 ended, which was the highest number ever recorded and a 20% increase in just a year. The La Niña weather phenomenon was one of the biggest causes behind climate-related displacements, triggering 2.1 million movements across Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Even though the event is generally triggered every 3-5 years, 2022 saw it happen for the third consecutive year, showcasing the dwindling state of climate around the globe. The event also generated record levels of flooding in Pakistan, Nigeria, and Brazil, impacting two separate clusters of countries differently.\xa0\xa0', 'The IDMC Global Report also touched upon how internal displacement aggravates food insecurity. According to their assessment,\xa0 three-quarters of the countries where food security was assessed had internally displaced populations. The highest number of food-insecure people were found in DRC, Yemen, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia. These countries collectively house over 26 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), which makes up a third of the global total. The Horn of Africa also faced its longest and most severe drought in 2022, showcasing extreme water scarcity in the region.\xa0', 'The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has reported on the link between economic development and climate change, stating that during the second half of the twentieth century, a country whose temperature rose by 1°C reported a 1.4% fall in per capita income on average. In April 2021, the Swiss Re Insitute published a report titled “The Economics of Climate Change: No Action Not An Option.” According to its findings, the global economy could lose 10% of its value due to climate change by 2050. However, if no policy actions are taken and temperatures rise by 3.2°C, 18% of global GDP could be lost in the same duration. Even if all countries meet the Paris Agreement targets, the global economy will still face a contraction of 4%.

Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) is a water technology provider that works on achieving water sustainability and combating water scarcity in more than 150 countries around the world. On February 29, 2024, Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) reported that in 2023, along with its partners, it supported 1,000 NGOs in 56 countries to deliver WASH access and education for local communities. Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) also provided humanitarian aid response to 30 climate disasters, including the provision of pro-bono emergency water treatment solutions to disaster-struck countries including Chile, Türkiye, Libya, and Morocco. The company’s 2025 sustainability goals include providing clean water and sanitation for at least 20 million individuals.\xa0', 'Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is an agricultural processing company working on innovative projects to increase crop yield and decrease food waste in low-income countries, battling food scarcity. In 2022, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) spent $120,000 on three different projects in India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia to combat post-harvest agricultural losses. Each of these projects were aimed at developing strategic partnerships and enabling farmers to increase the efficiency of their farming methods. On November 21, 2023, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) launched a Regenerative Agriculture Program in Brazil, intending to build 120,000 regenerative hectares by 2027. The program will enhance farmer productivity through three primary practices: fertilizer use efficiency, no-till farming, and covered soil crops.\xa0', 'Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) researches crop protection and seed growth management in order to make farming more efficient. The company is currently collaborating with several other partners to create biofortified sorghum as a means of tackling nutrient deficiency in 300 million people across Africa. Like Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) has also teamed up with Brazilian farmers by providing them with drought-tolerant soybeans as protection against the water stress common across several parts of the country. By developing these new technologies, companies like Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) are playing their role in mitigating the food scarcity prevalent throughout Africa today.\xa0', 'Despite all these efforts, climate risk continues to be a significant hurdle for almost every country in the world today. Keeping that in view, let’s look at the 15 countries with the most climate refugees currently. You can also check out 44 Countries With Hot and Wet Equatorial Climate.\xa0', '15 Countries with Most Climate Refugees in the World', 'Our Methodology', ""For the purpose of this article, we primarily looked at internal displacements that occurred in 2022 due to climate disasters. This is because, as corroborated by UNHCR data earlier, most climate-related displacements happen within the country, and there is no particular index yet that could quantify cross-border climate-induced migrations across the globe. The Internal Displacement and Monitoring Centre’s Global Report on Internal Displacement was used to source the displacement numbers.\xa0 Further insights from the report have been added for each country. \xa0In order to provide further context, we have mentioned the 2023 Net Migration Rate (migrants per 1,000 people) for each country, as reported by the CIA. Our rationale is that out of all the migrants that leave a country, some may do it due to climate risk. A negative value for the net migration rate is indicative of more outflows than inflows. We have also stated each country's climate vulnerability based on the 2021 ND-GAIN Index scores. This delivers information regarding the general climate risk a country is facing. The higher a country’s score, the more vulnerable it is to climate change.\xa0"", 'Based on this methodology, here are 15 countries with the highest number of climate refugees worldwide, ranked in ascending order of the internal displacements by disaster, primarily.', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 281,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.414', 'Net Migration Rate: -1.9', 'In Colombia, heavy floods caused by massive rainfall led disaster-related displacements to be higher than they had been in a decade. Most of the displacements took place in the Northern regions of Sucre and Bolívar, especially during the month of May when the rainy season peaked.\xa0', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 308,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.440', 'Net Migration Rate: -0.7', 'Indonesia is 14th on our list of countries with the most climate refugees, as it faced several climate-related disasters throughout the year. Geophysical hazards like earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic activity were the most prominent causes behind the internal displacements in Indonesia. The Cianjur earthquake on November 21, 2022, triggered 115,000 displacements alone.\xa0', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 353,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.475', 'Net Migration Rate: -0.2', 'Based on the high risk of heavy storms, governmental authorities in Vietnam set up several early warning systems and evacuation protocols. 96% of the country’s total disaster displacements were a result of the early evacuations before Typhoon Noru. This is how Vietnam became one of the countries with the most climate refugees globally.\xa0', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 423,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.564', 'Net Migration Rate: -0.6', 'The 2022 displacement figures from the Democratic Republic of Congo showcased a 48% increase from 2021. According to IDMC, DRC also hosts one of the world’s largest food-insecure populations, emphasizing the overlap of these two issues. Floods, heavy rains, and landslides were the causes behind the weather-related displacements in the country.\xa0', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 596,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.604', 'Net Migration Rate: 20', 'Due to recurring floods and conflict in the area, only 4% of the land is cultivated in South Sudan. Whatever little area is cultivated was destroyed by widespread flooding in 2022, which triggered severe food insecurity in the country. By the end of November 2022, it was reported that 54% of the population was facing acute food shortage. The total number of displacements in 2022 was the highest recorded number for South Sudan ever. South Sudan is placed 11th among the countries with the most climate refugees in the world.', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 675,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.309', 'Net Migration Rate: 3', 'Wildfires were the biggest cause of internal displacements in the United States in 2022. The ND-GAIN Index doesn’t classify the US as a climate-vulnerable country; however, the increasing number of wildfires does make it one of the countries with the most climate refugees in the world.\xa0', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 708,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.374', 'Net Migration Rate: -0.2\xa0', 'In 2022, Brazil and the US collectively accounted for two-thirds of the total disaster-related internal displacements in the Americas. Heavy storms, rains, and landslides were the main contributors to the issue. The country faced over 1,300 climate disasters in the year, each leading to displacements of some level, which collectively added up to 708,000 individuals, the highest figure in over a decade.\xa0', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 873,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.547', 'Net Migration Rate: -0.1', 'According to the IDMC, Ethiopia is facing the worst drought in four decades, which makes it one of the countries with the highest number of climate refugees. The worst drought-related situation was recorded in the Somali and Oromia regions. Around 686,000 displacements were triggered by drought alone. These conditions also contributed to severe food insecurity in the country.\xa0', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 1,152,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.678', 'Net Migration Rate: -1.4', 'The ND-GAIN Index ranks Somalia as the most climate-vulnerable country in the world out of 185 states. The 2022 drought in the Horn of Africa also affected Somalia, which accounted for 1.1 million out of the 2.1 million drought-related displacements in the region.

At least 482,000 displacements were triggered by the monsoon floods alone. The Cyclone Sitrang caused around a million displacements as well. Data reporting is a huge issue in Bangladesh because disaster reports only tend to be created for bigger hazards, which means many small-scale displacements go unreported.

Elevated transaction costs, uncertainty over projected cash flows, and a reserved private equity buyer pool contributed to average M&A valuations falling to 9.6x EV/EBITDA in 2023, compared to 9.9x in 2022. Several deals that transacted at premium valuations helped to bolster this average, while the median EBITDA multiple fell more drastically to 8.0x EV/EBITDA compared to 8.5x in the prior year. While business owners encountered a challenging valuation environment, several bright spots of the market have provided optimism for resilience and recovery in transaction value in 2024. Notably, average three-year EBITDA purchase multiples in the Business Services, FinTech & Services, Industrial Technology, Technology, Media & Telecom, and Transportation, Logistics & Supply Chain industries improved on a year-over-year (YOY) basis.', 'Buyers demonstrated heightened discipline in middle market M&A processes in 2023, refraining from overextending themselves to acquire target companies. While high-quality assets still commanded solid buyer interest and competition in bidding, market clearing bids were less frequent than in prior years. In 2023, 31% of transactions closed at 10x EBITDA or higher—a decline from 38% in 2022 and 43% in 2021. This may have coincided with buyers moving to lower levels of the middle market, a common occurrence amid market uncertainty. The average enterprise value of sold target companies amounted to $89.4 million, a substantial drop from $139.3 million in 2022. When buyers did pay premium multiples, typically these businesses had demonstrated gross margin defensibility, healthy revenue visibility, and sustained product or service demand.', 'Many dealmakers are optimistic that 2023 marked a trough for both middle market M&A volume and pricing, with 2024 positioned to experience a rebound in purchase multiples. Seller and buyer expectations are anticipated to become more aligned after such dislocation post-pandemic, when purchase multiples at times became detached from fundamentals. For the first time in nearly a decade, the cost of money is meaningful, and likely will be for the foreseeable future as the Federal Reserve works to meet its mandate. However, quality companies with sound financials and resilient end markets are poised to garner buyer appetite. Private equity buyers, facing limited partner pressure to generate returns, are expected to reenter the M&A markets in 2024 after sitting on the sidelines for much of 2023. The valuation environment may take some time to recover, but the M&A and macroeconomic environment in 2024 is expected to present a favorable backdrop for many prospective sellers to achieve an optimal exit.', 'Also included in this report:', 'A breakdown of three-year average middle market M&A valuations by industry.', 'Discussion of middle market M&A transaction volume on an industry level.', 'Commentary on the operating performance of target companies sold in 2023 compared to prior years.', 'To access to full report, click here.', 'ABOUT CAPSTONE PARTNERS', ""For over 20 years, the firm has been a trusted advisor to leading middle market companies, offering a fully integrated range of investment banking and financial advisory services uniquely tailored to help owners, investors, and creditors through each stage of the company's lifecycle.

Following this move, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) now holds the top position in Burry's Scion Asset Management portfolio, with Scion raising its stake in the e-commerce powerhouse by 50% by the end of December.

However, P/EV on the initial report was 79%. Under the new rules, we would not pay that price for the company today. We most likely would have waited for a mid-60s% P/EV, which would have equated to a $mid-teens entry price. In this case, we would have missed a too-large initial downturn in the stock price.

Our belief is the latter. Part of our catalyst is the market re-rating the stock higher once the length of the increased earnings power becomes understood. It is a relatively strong catalyst in the sense that with a strong dividend policy, we can be patient for the market to underwrite this story as the cash is either returned to us via a high dividend yield if the market is either slow or chooses not to join our side of the trade.', 'Our estimates suggest a time-charter equivalent rate (net profit or loss of operating a vessel daily) of at least $30,000 for SBLK in Q4, with the firm earning a potential annual average of $26,000. Our base case is that this is a strong floor going into next year, with little need to articulate much more upside. If rates hold, which we expect them to do, we could see a 20+% annual dividend next year for SBLK. If the market priced the equity such that the dividend yield was 8%, that implies a $62 stock. Today our base case target for the firm is $37 per share. This is likely conservative as we know that third-quarter rates are higher than the second quarter, and third-quarter dividends will most likely reflect that.

Unfortunately, CVS has its own history of overpriced acquisitions. The last one prior to that was in 2018, when CVS bought health insurer Aetna for $69 billion. We had assumed that CVS management, which has since changed, would recognise that mistake and learn from it. We were wrong. The acquisition of Oak Street Health is both disappointing and a warning to us. We now have a company in our portfolio whose capital allocation we consider to be poor and that should not be there.

If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model."", ' See our latest analysis for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ', ""We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$920.0m', '-US$343.2m', 'US$535.0m', 'US$736.9m', 'US$936.6m', 'US$1.12b', 'US$1.28b', 'US$1.42b', 'US$1.54b', 'US$1.64b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 37.73%', 'Est @ 27.10%', 'Est @ 19.66%', 'Est @ 14.45%', 'Est @ 10.80%', 'Est @ 8.25%', 'Est @ 6.46%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% ', 'US$825', '-US$276', 'US$386', 'US$477', 'US$544', 'US$584', 'US$599', 'US$595', 'US$578', 'US$552', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.9b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.6b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (11%– 2.3%) = US$18b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$18b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$6.1b', 'The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$11b.

Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'No major strengths identified for NCLH.', 'Weakness', 'Interest payments on debt are not well covered.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.', 'Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up.

In the current venture, MSI will deploy 4,000 VB400 body cameras for the national police.Police officers frequently operate in hostile environments where they face unpredictable and potentially hazardous situations. These encounters pose risks, including physical harm and injury, during their duty. Insufficient evidence in such circumstances may cast doubt on an officer's decision-making, leading to public scrutiny and unfavorable criticism.Global Peace Report specifies Austria as one of the safest countries. But per the Ministry of Interior, instances of cybercrime, smuggling and growing extremism are threats to the country. Leveraging Motorola’s video security technology, the Govt. is aiming to thwart these rising threats by boosting the security and efficiency of its police force nationwide.Motorola’s VB400 body cameras come with built-in connectivity and a full HD video recording feature. The robust camera is renowned for its durability, designed to capture vital incident footage throughout entire shifts. Its encryption feature ensures the integrity of the evidence captured.\xa0 \xa0Motorola’s offerings also include VideoManager evidence management software. A highly customizable evidence management solution that enables officers to prepare, process and share high-quality video evidence. Using the software, officers can seamlessly manage video footage organized by time, date and location as part of their daily workflows. Integration of these advanced capabilities will enable frontline personnel to efficiently handle potentially dangerous situations, capture evidence during operations, enhance safety and also help in post-incident investigations.The use of body-worn cameras improves transparency and accountability, which can foster trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. Motorola’s VB400 body-worn cameras are increasingly being deployed across the globe to boost the security of police officers. In 2023, London police and Lithuanian police also installed this solution across their police forces. This augurs well for the company’s long-term growth prospects.As a leading provider of mission-critical communication products and services worldwide, Motorola has ensured a steady revenue stream from this niche market.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag."", ""Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares."", ' See our latest analysis for Microsoft ', ""The President & Vice Chairman, Bradford Smith, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$412 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$429, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 8.7% of Bradford Smith's stake."", ""In the last year Microsoft insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!"", 'If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.', ""Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Microsoft. Specifically, insiders ditched US$33m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap."", ""I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Microsoft insiders own 0.03% of the company, worth about US$1.1b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders."", ""Insiders haven't bought Microsoft stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Microsoft makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

However, investing in a tech company with a reliable dividend can be an excellent way to expand your portfolio, benefiting from a high-growth industry and potential dividend reinvestment.', 'Five of the six most valuable companies in the world are tech firms. The industry generates massive amounts of cash, allowing some larger firms to reward investors with more than just stock growth.', ""While these companies' dividend yields might not compare to some non-tech stocks, they are worth considering along with their stellar share-price appreciation. So here are three dividend-paying tech stocks to buy right now."", ""Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business exploded last year as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the go-to for AI developers worldwide. The company became the first chipmaker to hit a market cap above $1 trillion, with its stock rising 249% in the last year."", 'The company paid its first dividend in 2013 and increased it every year until November 2018.

When companies like Amazon and Alphabet have no dividends, Nvidia's impressive stock growth, alongside even a small dividend, makes its stock worth buying."", ""Nvidia's quarterly revenue climbed 207% over the last year, while operating income has soared 536%. The company is on a promising growth trajectory that will likely see it raise its dividend in the coming years."", 'Data by YCharts', ""Moreover, this chart shows that Nvidia's earnings could hit nearly $36 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 yields a stock price of $1,294, projecting stock growth of 44% over the next two fiscal years."", ""Along with a reliable dividend, Nvidia's stock looks like a no-brainer investment right now."", 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is easily one of the most reliable options in tech, having increased its dividend payout for 19 consecutive years. The company raised its cash amount to $0.75 in 2023, which translates to an annual payout of $3 per share (three times what it was 11 years ago).', ""Consistent dividend growth reflects Microsoft's solid business model. Potent products like Windows, Office, Azure, and Xbox made the company a tech behemoth."", ""The success of these products has seen Microsoft's annual revenue rise 144% over the last decade, with operating income up 217%. Meanwhile, free cash flow has soared 150%, hitting over $67 billion last year."", 'Along with solid financials, there are plenty of reasons to believe Microsoft will continue increasing its dividend. It pays out only about 25% of its earnings in dividends, indicating it could keep growing its dividend even if headwinds arise.', ""Moreover, the company is investing heavily in some of the fastest-growing sectors, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft's lucrative positions in these markets will likely see its earnings continue to soar over the long term."", 'A forward P/E ratio of 36 makes its stock somewhat expensive. However, a dominating role in tech and consistent dividend growth means its stock has likely earned its high valuation and is worth considering right now.', 'Rather than focusing exclusively on high yields, one of the best ways to find dividend stocks is to seek out companies with significant cash resources, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). A focus on high yields could lead you to an investment in a financially struggling business; meanwhile, a cash cow like Apple can almost guarantee dividend growth over the long term.', 'In the last decade, its dividend yield has increased 104%. It rose to $0.24 per quarter in 2023, with a yield of 0.5%. Apple has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years, with its payout requiring only about 15% of its earnings.', ""Apple's yield might not be as impressive as popular dividend stocks like Verizon or Coca-Cola, but sticking with its current dividend growth trajectory could see the payouts double again over the next 10 years. With a stock that has risen 840% since 2014, the company could be one of the smartest long-term investments. "", ""And it's hard to argue with Apple's powerful position in tech. The company hit nearly $107 billion in free cash flow last year thanks to the immense popularity of products like the iPhone, MacBook, and iPad, as well as its many digital services."", ""The company's forward P/E of 27 makes it slightly cheaper than Microsoft but still pricey.

These offerings are designed to help customers store data, host websites, develop software, and even access AI, among other things."", ""In 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion in a little-known start-up called OpenAI. It agreed to inject a further $10 billion in early 2023 when OpenAI's ChatGPT online chatbot captured global attention. Microsoft is now weaving a combination of its own AI models and OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models into its entire product portfolio."", ""Copilot is Microsoft's AI-powered virtual assistant. It can answer complex questions, create content, and even write computer code. It's available on Windows, 365, Azure, the Edge internet browser, and the Bing search engine, and it could transform the company's economics."", 'Copilot for 365 can accelerate productivity in applications like Word and Excel. The corporate sector pays for more than 400 million 365 seats for their employees, which cost $12.50 per user, per month on the standard plan and $22 per user, per month on the premium plan. Microsoft charges an additional $30 per user, per month to include Copilot, so the financial opportunity is staggering.', ""Cloud computing is the largest of Microsoft's three core segments by revenue. The company offers OpenAI's GPT-4 models to its business customers on Azure, who can use them to develop their own AI applications. It also operates data centers powered by Nvidia's latest GPU chips, which organizations can rent to ensure they have the required computing power to develop those applications."", ""Microsoft had 53,000 Azure AI customers in the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), and one-third of them weren't Azure customers at all 12 months ago. Therefore, AI has become a key source of customer acquisition for Azure. The segment's revenue increased by 30% year over year in Q2, with 6 percentage points of that growth coming from AI specifically. That was double the contribution AI made just three months earlier."", ""To be clear, investing $250 in Microsoft stock today will probably never yield a $1.1 million return 38 years later because the company is simply too large. The best returns are almost certainly in the rearview mirror, but that doesn't mean Microsoft can't mint new millionaires -- it just means investors will have to outlay a larger sum of money."", ""Microsoft's revenue is forecast to come in at $244.3 billion in fiscal 2024 (ending June 30), and based on the company's $3.1 trillion valuation, it will place the stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12.7. Assuming that P/S ratio remains constant, the shares could deliver a fivefold return over the next 20 years if the tech titan can increase its annual revenue fivefold."", 'To do so, Microsoft will have to grow its revenue by 8.4% every year, eventually reaching $1.2 trillion by 2044. The company has grown its sales at a compound annual rate of 20.6% since 1986, which is well beyond that threshold, and even its forecast fiscal 2024 revenue will represent a 15.3% year-over-year increase.', ""Artificial intelligence is the big unknown. Goldman Sachs estimates the technology could add $7 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade. PwC thinks it will increase global economic activity by $15.7 trillion by 2030, and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest places that figure at $200 trillion. That's a gigantic opportunity, and it could even drive an acceleration in Microsoft's revenue growth."", ""Nevertheless, even if Microsoft's expansion slows significantly from here, its stock could still deliver a fivefold return in the next 20 years to potentially make a millionaire out of any investor who outlays $200,000 today."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

WBA is also piloting a virtual pharmacy to redefine connected care, increase patient access, enhance workplace flexibility and extend its pharmacist reach.

The DI-enabled smart meters help utility companies in achieving their carbon reduction target through various practices including “streamlining field operations” and “reducing truck rolls.”Each meter connected to the IIoT network provides visibility to the energy providers to help them manage the grid more accurately in real time. Energy providers can harness the robust capabilities of Itron’s Gen5 IIoT network coupled with DI to smoothly incorporate additional applications from Itron and partners.Furthermore, the DI-enabled smart meters are significant for providing Xcel Energy’s customers with useful data on their electric consumption, which aids them in making informed decisions regarding energy usage. This helps them to lower their energy costs as well as help XEL to reduce its carbon footprint. The reduction in carbon footprint will help it meet its target of supplying carbon-free electricity by 2050 across the states.\xa0In addition, the smart meters accelerate outage tracking, which enables Xcel Energy to respond quickly to customer outage notifications and resolutions.Itron is a market leader in energy, water, smart city, IIoT and intelligent infrastructure services across the globe.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis, you can directly go to the 5 Countries with the Most Climate Refugees in the World.\xa0', 'UNHCR reported that of all the internal displacements that took place in 2022, more than half were triggered by climate-related disasters. As the link between climate risk and human displacement grows, there’s a widespread concern that the phenomenon might trigger massive migrations from the Global South to the Global North. However, UNHCR states that the majority of the people forced to move due to climate risk tend to shift within their own countries. The IDMC Global Report on Internal Displacement mentioned that climate-related disasters triggered 32.6 million internal displacements in 2022. Furthermore, UNHCR reported that 70% of all refugees shift to neighboring countries in an attempt to stay close to family, so affected individuals are less likely to move longer distances. Because most climate displacements happen within the state borders, ‘climate refugee’ is not a term officially recognized by international law.\xa0', 'According to the IDMC Global Report, a total of 71.1 million people were living in internal displacement when 2022 ended, which was the highest number ever recorded and a 20% increase in just a year. The La Niña weather phenomenon was one of the biggest causes behind climate-related displacements, triggering 2.1 million movements across Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Even though the event is generally triggered every 3-5 years, 2022 saw it happen for the third consecutive year, showcasing the dwindling state of climate around the globe. The event also generated record levels of flooding in Pakistan, Nigeria, and Brazil, impacting two separate clusters of countries differently.\xa0\xa0', 'The IDMC Global Report also touched upon how internal displacement aggravates food insecurity. According to their assessment,\xa0 three-quarters of the countries where food security was assessed had internally displaced populations. The highest number of food-insecure people were found in DRC, Yemen, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia. These countries collectively house over 26 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), which makes up a third of the global total. The Horn of Africa also faced its longest and most severe drought in 2022, showcasing extreme water scarcity in the region.\xa0', 'The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has reported on the link between economic development and climate change, stating that during the second half of the twentieth century, a country whose temperature rose by 1°C reported a 1.4% fall in per capita income on average. In April 2021, the Swiss Re Insitute published a report titled “The Economics of Climate Change: No Action Not An Option.” According to its findings, the global economy could lose 10% of its value due to climate change by 2050. However, if no policy actions are taken and temperatures rise by 3.2°C, 18% of global GDP could be lost in the same duration. Even if all countries meet the Paris Agreement targets, the global economy will still face a contraction of 4%.

On February 29, 2024, Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) reported that in 2023, along with its partners, it supported 1,000 NGOs in 56 countries to deliver WASH access and education for local communities. Xylem Inc.

In 2022, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) spent $120,000 on three different projects in India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia to combat post-harvest agricultural losses. Each of these projects were aimed at developing strategic partnerships and enabling farmers to increase the efficiency of their farming methods. On November 21, 2023, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) launched a Regenerative Agriculture Program in Brazil, intending to build 120,000 regenerative hectares by 2027. The program will enhance farmer productivity through three primary practices: fertilizer use efficiency, no-till farming, and covered soil crops.\xa0', 'Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) researches crop protection and seed growth management in order to make farming more efficient. The company is currently collaborating with several other partners to create biofortified sorghum as a means of tackling nutrient deficiency in 300 million people across Africa. Like Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) has also teamed up with Brazilian farmers by providing them with drought-tolerant soybeans as protection against the water stress common across several parts of the country. By developing these new technologies, companies like Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) are playing their role in mitigating the food scarcity prevalent throughout Africa today.\xa0', 'Despite all these efforts, climate risk continues to be a significant hurdle for almost every country in the world today.

You can also check out 44 Countries With Hot and Wet Equatorial Climate.\xa0', '15 Countries with Most Climate Refugees in the World', 'Our Methodology', ""For the purpose of this article, we primarily looked at internal displacements that occurred in 2022 due to climate disasters. This is because, as corroborated by UNHCR data earlier, most climate-related displacements happen within the country, and there is no particular index yet that could quantify cross-border climate-induced migrations across the globe. The Internal Displacement and Monitoring Centre’s Global Report on Internal Displacement was used to source the displacement numbers.\xa0 Further insights from the report have been added for each country. \xa0In order to provide further context, we have mentioned the 2023 Net Migration Rate (migrants per 1,000 people) for each country, as reported by the CIA. Our rationale is that out of all the migrants that leave a country, some may do it due to climate risk. A negative value for the net migration rate is indicative of more outflows than inflows. We have also stated each country's climate vulnerability based on the 2021 ND-GAIN Index scores. This delivers information regarding the general climate risk a country is facing. The higher a country’s score, the more vulnerable it is to climate change.\xa0"", 'Based on this methodology, here are 15 countries with the highest number of climate refugees worldwide, ranked in ascending order of the internal displacements by disaster, primarily.', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 281,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.414', 'Net Migration Rate: -1.9', 'In Colombia, heavy floods caused by massive rainfall led disaster-related displacements to be higher than they had been in a decade.

The Cianjur earthquake on November 21, 2022, triggered 115,000 displacements alone.\xa0', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 353,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.475', 'Net Migration Rate: -0.2', 'Based on the high risk of heavy storms, governmental authorities in Vietnam set up several early warning systems and evacuation protocols. 96% of the country’s total disaster displacements were a result of the early evacuations before Typhoon Noru.

According to IDMC, DRC also hosts one of the world’s largest food-insecure populations, emphasizing the overlap of these two issues. Floods, heavy rains, and landslides were the causes behind the weather-related displacements in the country.\xa0', 'Internal Displacements by Disaster: 596,000', 'ND-GAIN Score: 0.604', 'Net Migration Rate: 20', 'Due to recurring floods and conflict in the area, only 4% of the land is cultivated in South Sudan.

By the end of November 2022, it was reported that 54% of the population was facing acute food shortage. The total number of displacements in 2022 was the highest recorded number for South Sudan ever.

Heavy storms, rains, and landslides were the main contributors to the issue.

At least 482,000 displacements were triggered by the monsoon floods alone. The Cyclone Sitrang caused around a million displacements as well.

Its current level marks the highest in 23 years. Since the beginning of 2024, market participants have been busy predicting when the central bank will cut interest rates for the first time.', 'Recently, a large section of financial researchers and economists were worried about the rate cut as the inflation rate remains sticky supported by a resilient labor market, increasing wage rate and strong consumer spending. However, in a relief to investors, the Fed reiterated the number of interest rate cuts that it had indicated in the December FOMC meeting.', 'Fed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate to come down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.', 'In his post-FOMC statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, “We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this type of cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.”', 'Following the March FOMC decision, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 75% probability that the first rate cut will come in the June FOMC meeting.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted a new closing high of 16,369.41.', 'Despite its higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology.

Moreover, many of these companies depend on the chip source of credit for the business to grow.', 'The ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI.

The significance of this announcement is with the continued move of high performance compute."", ""You really simply can't build a leading edge chip without us.

The strategy borrows from the basics of momentum investing. This technique bets on “buy high, sell higher.”"", 'Many times, stocks that hit a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.', 'We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential.

This is largely due to the substantial contribution these stocks make to overall market returns over extended periods. Data from 1926 to July 2023 indicates that dividend income constituted 32% of the monthly total return of the S&P 500, with the remainder attributed to capital appreciation. Moreover, dividends have demonstrated resilience during periods of high inflation. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, in decades marked by significant inflation, such as the 1940s and 1970s, dividend income accounted for more than half of the total return.', 'According to a study conducted by Wisdom Tree, dividend-paying stocks have been highlighted as capable of producing significant levels of income. The report indicated that by emphasizing dividends, investors can substantially enhance their dividend earnings and potentially raise the trailing 12-month dividend yield. This strategy becomes particularly valuable in times of low yields and returns, marked by market volatility and uncertainty. Investing in dividend-weighted indexes could offer investors a means to generate essential income in such challenging environments.', 'Experienced investors, along with regular investors, stress the significance of including dividend-paying stocks in investment portfolios to ensure a steady income stream. Brian Bollinger, the president of Simply Safe Dividends, discussed the role of dividends in generating income during an interview with CNBC. He suggested that for those seeking genuinely passive income, dividend investing is a viable option. While relying on dividends for income is a common practice for retirees or those approaching retirement age, Bollinger emphasized that anyone can construct a portfolio focused on generating income from equities. He further highlighted the importance of building a source of income independent of traditional paychecks.', 'Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some of the most prominent dividend stocks as these companies have a proven track record of consistently increasing their dividends over the years, making them reliable options for shareholders looking to generate income passively.

However, P/EV on the initial report was 79%. Under the new rules, we would not pay that price for the company today. We most likely would have waited for a mid-60s% P/EV, which would have equated to a $mid-teens entry price. In this case, we would have missed a too-large initial downturn in the stock price. The overweight rule dictated that we trimmed the position after the price ran up in the first half of 2023, which benefitted overall performance as the stock price subsequently fell again.

Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”', 'Booking’s experiments in AI demonstrate the value of proprietary data sets. While general AI systems such as ChatGPT are designed to answer questions about anything, focused AI systems that leverage a company’s unique data can be far more powerful when applied to specific use cases. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, the system is unable to answer questions unrelated to making travel reservations. But on the other hand, it is far more likely to understand what the user wants since it already knows that the entire conversation will be about travel.

We have yet to see the long-awaited re-acceleration in AWS (Amazon Web Services) revenue growth. However, in our estimation, the segment’s growth has likely bottomed, and we could see accelerating growth in 2024. Further, Amazon’s e-commerce business has gradually re-accelerated from 2022’s levels and, perhaps most importantly, the company’s margins and free cash flow have rebounded materially from last year. This rebound in margins and free cash flow at Amazon has been a key component of our long-term thesis for the business, and we expect the improvement in these metrics to continue into 2024 and beyond (though perhaps not linearly) as the company continues to optimize costs and capital expenditures.

After announcing their new dividend policy in May, SBLK now has one of the best payout structures in shipping. The firm has paid out $0.3 and $0.7 per share in dividends for the first and second quarters of 2021. SBLK will most likely announce a dividend for the third quarter somewhere in the $1.15-$1.25 per share range, depending on movement in net working capital.', 'We believe the best way to look at this business is through cash generation potential and how much is returned to investors. The current equity valuation does not reflect current rates for shipping (earnings), partly because of the velocity of the move in rates and because shipping cycles turn, and it’s not clear whether this is a local top or the early innings of a multi-year cycle. Our belief is the latter. Part of our catalyst is the market re-rating the stock higher once the length of the increased earnings power becomes understood. It is a relatively strong catalyst in the sense that with a strong dividend policy, we can be patient for the market to underwrite this story as the cash is either returned to us via a high dividend yield if the market is either slow or chooses not to join our side of the trade.', 'Our estimates suggest a time-charter equivalent rate (net profit or loss of operating a vessel daily) of at least $30,000 for SBLK in Q4, with the firm earning a potential annual average of $26,000. Our base case is that this is a strong floor going into next year, with little need to articulate much more upside. If rates hold, which we expect them to do, we could see a 20+% annual dividend next year for SBLK. If the market priced the equity such that the dividend yield was 8%, that implies a $62 stock. Today our base case target for the firm is $37 per share. This is likely conservative as we know that third-quarter rates are higher than the second quarter, and third-quarter dividends will most likely reflect that. We are cautious about diving too deep into the sensitivities to the upside with this position as we are arriving at some pretty remunerative torque using current contracted values and seemingly conservative forecasts…”', 'Scion Asset Management’s Stake Value: $4.89 million', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 166', ""Among Michael Burry's top stock picks for the fourth quarter of 2023 is Alphabet Inc.

Unfortunately, CVS has its own history of overpriced acquisitions. The last one prior to that was in 2018, when CVS bought health insurer Aetna for $69 billion. We had assumed that CVS management, which has since changed, would recognise that mistake and learn from it. We were wrong. The acquisition of Oak Street Health is both disappointing and a warning to us. We now have a company in our portfolio whose capital allocation we consider to be poor and that should not be there.

Wells Fargo analysts also drew a contrast between the tech bubble of March 2000 and the market rally of today, adding that the market conditions today don’t have resemblance with the tech bubble of the past because of the underlying strengths of companies.

That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares.

(NYSE:GOLD) reported its fourth quarter and full-year results for 2023.', 'Barrick Gold is one of my top four long-term gold miners, along with Newmont (NYSE:NEM), Agnico Eagle (NYSE:AEM) and Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC). These companies should be the first choice for an average investor looking to make a long-term investment in gold.', ""Based on a recent presentation, it was revealed that half of Barrick Gold's production comes from North America, with 13 gold mines and three copper mines."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Sign with AEM.', ""Agnico Eagle and Kinross Gold have outperformed the VanEck Gold Miner ETF (GDX), rising 11% and 38% year over year, compared to the exchange-traded fund's 5% increase. Barrick Gold and Newmont, on the other hand, have continued to underperform, falling by 6% and 25% in a single year."", 'The spot price of gold ended at $2,156 an ounce on Friday. It should have driven gold stocks higher, but that is not happening. It proved the relationship between gold miners and the metal is not as strong as the correlation between oil producers and oil prices.', 'Gold prices have experienced a significant increase in the past six and a half years. In October 2018, the price was approximately $1,200 per ounce, and it has now climbed to $2,159, nearing an all-time high. Unfortunately, the mining industry has not followed the same trajectory.', ""A variety of factors contributed to the mining industry's underperformance. We can identify a few intrinsic factors that could explain Barrick Gold's undervaluation."", 'First, the number of favorable jurisdictions for gold mining has decreased over the last decade. Many previously safe jurisdictions in Asia, Africa and Latin America are now under threat. Political risks have resulted in a valuation decline that is difficult to reverse for companies like Barrick Gold, whose output is partially dependent on less favorable locations like West Africa.', ""Barrick, for example, intends to resume operations at the Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea. The mine has been under care and maintenance since 2020 due to the country's refusal to renew permits and renegotiate the agreement. With a 49% stake, Barrick is now the mine's operator."", 'It is the same issue that Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) encountered with its Grasberg gold and copper mine in Papua New Guinea. We can also recall the North Mara in Tanzania, which experienced numerous setbacks a few years ago before resuming production under a new agreement.', ""One of the company's main strategic priorities is to raise copper production. Lumwana's development is planned to produce 240,000 tons of copper annually. Additionally, the company is progressing with its Reko Diq project, which focuses on gold and copper production."", ""The project's capital expenditure is expected to be $7 billion, with a potential start date of 2025 and first production in 2028. It is a significant investment, but I have some reservations. Balochistan Province in Pakistan faces increasing security threats and local opposition to the project. The company seems intent to press on even though local tribes claim ownership of the site and the Baloch Raji Aajoi Sangar insurgent organization warned it to stay away."", 'As a result, when investing in Barrick Gold, it is critical to consider these risk factors. Investors hesitant to expose themselves to high-risk companies should look into Agnico Eagle, which has a much safer asset portfolio, or Newmont, which is undervalued and owns good tier-1 assets.', ""Regardless, CEO Mark Bristow clearly stated why the company's strategy will be successful and noted its 2023 reserves are an important indicator. He said during the fourth-quarter conference call:"", '""Highlights of the year were our sustained and industry-leading gold and copper reserve replacement, one of the key differentiators between Barrick and its peers.""', ""Mineral reserves for 2023 are now 77 million ounces of gold, 5.6 million tons of copper and 170 million ounces of silver. This is much higher than Agnico Eagle's 53.8 million ounces of gold, 56.9 million ounces of silver and 0.7 million tons of copper."", 'However, Newmont is the leading gold miner in reserves with 135.9 million ounces of gold, 596 million ounces of silver and 13.6 million tons of copper following the recent acquisition of Newcrest. Unfortunately, large mineral reserves are not a guarantee of success.', ""Barrick's net earnings rose from a loss of $735 million, or 42 cents, in the same period last year to a profit of $479 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, in fourth-quarter 2023. Revenue rose from $2.77 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $3.06 billion."", 'Yearly revenue and production were slightly better than the preceding year, as shown below:', ""The results exceeded analysts' expectations, indicating the company's production is expanding. I was pleasantly surprised by Nevada's mine production this quarter, which totaled 513,000 ounces of gold equivalent, up from 478,000 ounces in the third quarter of 2023."", 'The trailing 12-month free cash flow was $626 million, but was $136 million in the fourth quarter. I find it a little low.', ""The cash flow generated from operations was $997 million, higher than the previous year's $795 million. This capital expenditure was $861 million, slightly lower than the previous year."", 'The company is experiencing a positive impact due to the rise in gold prices and increased output. This trend is expected to continue as the current price of gold is more than $2,160 per ounce. Moreover, Barrick Gold is confident about producing a solid amount of gold equivalent production until 2033.', ""On Feb. 13, the board of directors authorized a new share buyback program to purchase up to $1 billion of Barrick's outstanding common shares over the next 12 months. The company did not buy back any shares in 2023."", ""According to the company's dividend policy, Barrick Gold announced a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share in the fourth quarter, offering a 2.50% dividend yield."", 'Finally, the debt situation has increased noticeably with $1.02 billion in net debt and a net debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 0.15. The chart below shows net debt is up slightly quarter over quarter.', 'During the fourth quarter, 1,054,000 ounces of gold (1,042,000 ounces sold) and 113 million pounsd of copper (117 million pounds sold) were produced at a gold price of $1,971 per ounce. While gold production fell by 5.90% per year, copper production rose by 17.70%.', 'The realized average copper price was $3.78 per pound compared to $3.81 last year.', 'Gold production has steadily increased over the next four quarters and is expected to continue with the restart of the Porgera mine in the first quarter of 2024. Gold production per mine is indicated below:', 'As for copper, the Lumwana mine did particularly well with 73 million pounds, up 1.50% quarter over quarter. The Lumwana feasibility study is on track for completion by the end of 2024.', 'Copper production is likely to increase, with the price of copper increasing to $3.78 per pound this quarter.', 'Note, the dividend is taken into account in the chart.', 'Gold follows a descending channel pattern, with resistance at $16 and support at $14.50. The relative strength index is now 57, insignificant enough to indicate a possible extended trend. The chart pattern is still descending, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, after a brief period of consolidation, it could signal a longer-term upward trend. Notice how the stock price retraced to the 50-day moving average, which is frequently used as a weak intermediate support.', 'It is recommended to keep a core long-term holding and allocate roughly 40% to LIFO trading while waiting for a potential final breakthrough in 2024, assuming gold prices stay between $2,150 and $2,200 per ounce.', 'Selling between $15.90 and $16.25 is the recommended mid-term trading strategy; a higher resistance level at $16.75 might also be present. I recommend accumulating between $14.75 and $14, with a lower potential support at $13.75', 'Warning: The TA chart must be updated frequently to be relevant.

RBC Capital Markets Mining Analyst Sam Crittenden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his bullish outlook on the precious metal.', 'According to Crittenden, the copper rally ""has been expected for a few months now."" He highlights that supply disruptions during the fourth quarter of 2023 transformed what was anticipated to be a surplus in 2024 into a deficit, which has ""driven these higher prices."" While sluggish demand from regions like China has been a concern, he notes that as the summer construction season approaches, typically a ""strong period,"" demand concerns could potentially abate, driving copper prices even higher.', 'However, Crittenden explains that the energy transition stands to be the biggest driver of copper demand going forward.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", ""- All right, let's take a look at some of those commodities moving to the upside. Copper prices are steadying after hitting an 11th month high earlier this week. Now the surge in commodity pricing driving mining stocks higher as well, with shares of companies like Teck Resources and Capstone Copper both climbing in the last month. For more on this, we want to bring in Sam Crittenden. He is RBC Capital Markets' Mining Analyst. Just first your reaction to this massive run up that we've seen in copper prices and where copper is trading today."", ""SAM CRITTENDEN: This has actually been expected for a few months now. So if you go back to Q4 of last year, we saw a number of supply disruptions in the copper space. So there is a large mine in Panama, Cobre, Panama, that went offline. You also saw some production downgrades from some of the larger companies. And that basically took 3% out of our supply estimate for this year. And so that flipped what we had as a surplus coming into 2024 to more of a deficit. And that's really driven these higher prices. People were expecting that for a while and it started-- you're finally starting to see that happen here in the last few weeks."", ""- And so if this was expected, Sam, what are the kind of top ideas that you're looking towards to continue to implement perhaps in the copper space?"", 'SAM CRITTENDEN: Yeah, so our top picks in the equities will be Teck Resources, as you mentioned, Capstone Copper, and Ivanhoe Mines. Those are three names, we think both-- all three of them have excellent growth prospects for this year and beyond. And those would be our top ideas in the sector.', '- In terms of where the pricing, that upside, what does that look like here from current levels?', ""SAM CRITTENDEN: Yeah. So our price estimate for this year is $4.25 and we have that going to $4.50 for next year. So we don't see those supply disruptions I mentioned easing anytime soon. And so I think you will see constrained supply for the foreseeable future and if demand picks up."", ""So there are still some concerns on the demand side. China's been a little bit sluggish in recent weeks coming out of the New Year holidays. But if that picks up as we head into summer construction season, typically a strong period over the next few months, we think you'll see that follow-through on the demand side and can drive higher copper prices from here."", ""- You know, it's really interesting. We had a guest on a few weeks back I want to say who was talking about the correlation between the semiconductor demand that we're seeing and copper because of some of the interconnects that are used. I wonder where that factors into your thesis here?"", ""SAM CRITTENDEN: Yeah. So I mean that's a part of it. But I think broadly, the energy transition is the biggest driver that's going to drive increased copper demand over the next several years. And I mean, I think as we build out renewable infrastructure, that's a key component. Electric vehicles use three times the amount of copper. All of the renewable energy that's being built out is very copper intensive. And data centers and some of the other electronic components certainly are copper intensive as well. So it all feeds into our positive thesis for copper on growing demand over the next several years.""]"

You can skip our analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Countries that have the Most F-16 Fighter Jets.', 'The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-seat, single-engine fighter jet that was initially developed as a lighter and cheaper equivalent of the F-15, but has grown into being among the most widely used fighter jets in the world. More than 4,600 units of the aircraft have been produced to date, with production still ongoing. As older versions of the jet retire, newer and upgraded F-16s take center stage.', 'Originally built by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) for the United States and its allies with the first order placed in 1972, the F-16 entered service with the US Air Force in 1978. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) continued to manufacture the fighter jet until it sold its aircraft manufacturing business to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in 1993. More than 25 countries operate the F-16 today, with more joining, making it the most widely operated fighter jet in the world, currently.\xa0', 'Earlier in January this year, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) delivered Slovakia the first two of its total 14 F-16 Block 70 fighters ordered in 2018 for $1.8 billion. The country retired its aging fleet of 11 MiG-29s two years ago, and is replacing them with the F-16. The Block 70/72 is the latest version of the fighter aircraft, and is operated by only six countries, with Slovakia becoming the first European nation to operate the variant. The remaining deliveries are scheduled by 2025.', 'Turkiye is also set to receive the Block-70 F-16s. The country’s deadlock with the United States over the purchase of these fighter jets ended in February, more than two years after Ankara made the request for the F-16s. Ties between the two countries had strained after Washington expelled Turkiye from the F-35 program following the latter’s procurement of a missile defense system from Russia in 2017. The US agreed to the sale of the F-16 only after Ankara approved Sweden’s NATO membership bid. The deal is valued at $23 billion. Turkiye’s history with the fourth-generation fighter goes way back to 1983, when it entered into a $4 billion deal with General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) for 160 F-16 fighters.', 'According to a report in the New York Times, Ukraine is also likely to deploy six of the 45 F-16s promised by its European allies by July this year. Kyiv is currently in the process of training its pilots, who by the end of 2023, had progressed from taking foundational flight skills in the United Kingdom, to advanced instructions in Denmark related to the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Ukraine will receive new jets built by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), as well as the older F-16s being phased out by European countries to replace them with the F-35 fifth-generation fighter.', '\xa0', 'We have ranked countries that have the most F-16 fighter jets in ascending order of their fleet size.

According to the country’s Ministry of Defense, the upgrade has increased the operational service of the fleet to the mid 2030s.', 'F-16 Fighter Jets: 75', 'Much like the country’s nuclear weapons, the F-16 fighter jets are a symbol of military strength in Pakistan, with images of the jet being adorned on billboards on national days and on commercial trucks that move along the nation’s highways. It is a weapon which provides Pakistan a perceived edge over its arch rival India in aerial conflicts, as was seen in the dogfight between the two countries in the Kashmir region in 2019. 44 of these jets are used as combat aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force, while 31 are currently training aircraft. In 2022, the Biden administration approved a $450m fleet sustainment sale for Pakistan’s F-16 jets, aimed at enhancing their air-to-ground capabilities.\xa0', 'F-16 Fighter Jets: 76', 'The United Arab Emirates procured 80 F-16 fighter jets from the United States, as part of a $6.4 billion deal signed in 1998, of which 76 currently remain in operation according to FlightGlobal. These aircraft have significantly contributed to the UAE’s aerial power in the region, with the Emiratis continuing to spend heavily on upgrading and maintaining these jets.

The support from the government is aiding the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, with its expanding clean power generation portfolio and customer base, renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio are Consolidated Edison Inc. ED, EverSource Energy ES and CenterPoint Energy Inc. CNP.', 'About the Industry', 'The Utility – Electric Power industry involves the generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation, demand for the services provided by utilities remains steady, regardless of economic cycles. A very hot summer and cold winter season increases demand for electricity. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in reducing emissions. However, still-high interest rates are a headwind for capital-intensive utilities.', '3 Electric Power Industry Trends in Focus', 'Transition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:\xa0 The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 23% in 2023 to 24% in 2024 and touch 25% in 2025 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. It has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for the use of renewable sources. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Demand and Price for Electricity: Per EIA, electricity supply volumes in the United States will increase 3% in 2024 from the 2023 level. A major portion of the electricity will be generated from clean energy sources. EIA predicts the price of electricity to U.S. residential customers in 2024 to average 15.87 cents per kWh, about 0.7% lower than the 2023 level. The decline in input costs is likely to be passed on to residential customers. EIA expects retail electricity prices in the commercial and industrial sectors to drop in 2024. The drop in expected energy prices in the near term will adversely impact the prospects of the utilities.Still-high Interest Rate a Headwind: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans as the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. Multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve took the benchmark rate to the 5.25-5.50% range, which impacted utility operators. However, in its last five meetings, the Fed did not increase the benchmark rate.

For more on this, we want to bring in Sam Crittenden. He is RBC Capital Markets' Mining Analyst. Just first your reaction to this massive run up that we've seen in copper prices and where copper is trading today."", ""SAM CRITTENDEN: This has actually been expected for a few months now. So if you go back to Q4 of last year, we saw a number of supply disruptions in the copper space. So there is a large mine in Panama, Cobre, Panama, that went offline. You also saw some production downgrades from some of the larger companies. And that basically took 3% out of our supply estimate for this year. And so that flipped what we had as a surplus coming into 2024 to more of a deficit. And that's really driven these higher prices. People were expecting that for a while and it started-- you're finally starting to see that happen here in the last few weeks."", ""- And so if this was expected, Sam, what are the kind of top ideas that you're looking towards to continue to implement perhaps in the copper space?"", 'SAM CRITTENDEN: Yeah, so our top picks in the equities will be Teck Resources, as you mentioned, Capstone Copper, and Ivanhoe Mines. Those are three names, we think both-- all three of them have excellent growth prospects for this year and beyond.

So our price estimate for this year is $4.25 and we have that going to $4.50 for next year. So we don't see those supply disruptions I mentioned easing anytime soon. And so I think you will see constrained supply for the foreseeable future and if demand picks up."", ""So there are still some concerns on the demand side. China's been a little bit sluggish in recent weeks coming out of the New Year holidays. But if that picks up as we head into summer construction season, typically a strong period over the next few months, we think you'll see that follow-through on the demand side and can drive higher copper prices from here."", ""- You know, it's really interesting. We had a guest on a few weeks back I want to say who was talking about the correlation between the semiconductor demand that we're seeing and copper because of some of the interconnects that are used. I wonder where that factors into your thesis here?"", ""SAM CRITTENDEN: Yeah. So I mean that's a part of it. But I think broadly, the energy transition is the biggest driver that's going to drive increased copper demand over the next several years. And I mean, I think as we build out renewable infrastructure, that's a key component. Electric vehicles use three times the amount of copper. All of the renewable energy that's being built out is very copper intensive. And data centers and some of the other electronic components certainly are copper intensive as well.

Data from 1926 to July 2023 indicates that dividend income constituted 32% of the monthly total return of the S&P 500, with the remainder attributed to capital appreciation.

More than 4,600 units of the aircraft have been produced to date, with production still ongoing. As older versions of the jet retire, newer and upgraded F-16s take center stage.', 'Originally built by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) for the United States and its allies with the first order placed in 1972, the F-16 entered service with the US Air Force in 1978. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) continued to manufacture the fighter jet until it sold its aircraft manufacturing business to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in 1993.

The country retired its aging fleet of 11 MiG-29s two years ago, and is replacing them with the F-16. The Block 70/72 is the latest version of the fighter aircraft, and is operated by only six countries, with Slovakia becoming the first European nation to operate the variant. The remaining deliveries are scheduled by 2025.', 'Turkiye is also set to receive the Block-70 F-16s. The country’s deadlock with the United States over the purchase of these fighter jets ended in February, more than two years after Ankara made the request for the F-16s. Ties between the two countries had strained after Washington expelled Turkiye from the F-35 program following the latter’s procurement of a missile defense system from Russia in 2017. The US agreed to the sale of the F-16 only after Ankara approved Sweden’s NATO membership bid. The deal is valued at $23 billion. Turkiye’s history with the fourth-generation fighter goes way back to 1983, when it entered into a $4 billion deal with General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) for 160 F-16 fighters.', 'According to a report in the New York Times, Ukraine is also likely to deploy six of the 45 F-16s promised by its European allies by July this year. Kyiv is currently in the process of training its pilots, who by the end of 2023, had progressed from taking foundational flight skills in the United Kingdom, to advanced instructions in Denmark related to the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

According to the country’s Ministry of Defense, the upgrade has increased the operational service of the fleet to the mid 2030s.', 'F-16 Fighter Jets: 75', 'Much like the country’s nuclear weapons, the F-16 fighter jets are a symbol of military strength in Pakistan, with images of the jet being adorned on billboards on national days and on commercial trucks that move along the nation’s highways. It is a weapon which provides Pakistan a perceived edge over its arch rival India in aerial conflicts, as was seen in the dogfight between the two countries in the Kashmir region in 2019. 44 of these jets are used as combat aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force, while 31 are currently training aircraft. In 2022, the Biden administration approved a $450m fleet sustainment sale for Pakistan’s F-16 jets, aimed at enhancing their air-to-ground capabilities.\xa0', 'F-16 Fighter Jets: 76', 'The United Arab Emirates procured 80 F-16 fighter jets from the United States, as part of a $6.4 billion deal signed in 1998, of which 76 currently remain in operation according to FlightGlobal. These aircraft have significantly contributed to the UAE’s aerial power in the region, with the Emiratis continuing to spend heavily on upgrading and maintaining these jets.

Taipei, right since independence, has focused on raising a strong military due to the perceived threat of a Chinese invasion.

As the inflation rate displays indications of easing and the economy remains stable, the Federal Open Market Committee's unanimous decision to sustain the benchmark within a targeted range of 5.25%-5.5% offers stability for homebuilders.On Mar 20, 2024, the Federal Reserve opted to maintain its key interest rate unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting, citing the need for further data before considering rate cuts.

However, their projections for rate cuts in 2025 and 2026 have been revised downward. Additionally, they foresee slightly higher interest rates in the long term compared to their December projections.Prudent Land Investments: PulteGroup has consistently experienced enhanced volumes, revenues and profitability, given its annual land acquisition strategies. In 2023, the company invested $4.3 billion in land acquisition and development, with 59% allocated to development endeavors. For 2024, PHM intends to increase its land expenditure to approximately $5 billion, aiming for a distribution of around 60/40 between development and land acquisition.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, first-time buyers constituted 40% of its customer base, while move-up buyers comprised 36%, and active adult buyers made up 24%. This shift toward prioritizing first-time buyers aligns with the company's strategy to have more than one-third of its business directed toward this segment.Regarding order activity categorized by buyer group, there was a notable 70% increase in net new orders from first-time buyers, a 78% increase from move-up buyers and a 15% rise from active adult buyers.

Medical advancements have also led to longer life spans, ultimately causing population growth. In 1900, the average life expectancy in the US was just under 47 years. By 2023, it has risen to nearly 76.4 years. Medical innovations and solutions by popular healthcare companies like Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also have a role to play in increasing the average life expectancy in the country.', 'Furthermore, the fertility rates have also affected population trends. Historically, the US has experienced relatively high fertility rates. In the early 1900s, the average woman had between 3 and 4 children. This contributed significantly to population growth, particularly in the post-World War II baby boom era, when fertility rates peaked at nearly four children per woman. However, these rates have declined steadily since the 1960s, reaching a record low of 1.64 births per woman in 2020.', 'While the overall population continues to grow, the US exhibits significant regional variations in density and distribution. The US population density per square mile is 93.8 people. It varies significantly throughout the country, with the District of Columbia having 11,280 people per square mile in contrast to Alaska having just 1.3 people per square mile. This variation is based on a couple of factors. Firstly, the 21st century has seen the rise of megacities leading to urbanization.\xa0 In 1950, 64% of the population of the US lived in urban cities. This population concentration in urban areas has increased significantly to 83% during present times. By 2050, this number is expected to increase to 89%. In contrast, many rural areas are experiencing population decline. From 2000 to 2010, 346 out of 1336 counties lost 5% or more of their working-age population. Between 2010 and 2020, losses increased nearly three-fold, with more than 970 rural counties losing 5% of their population. Limited economic opportunities and out-migration towards urban centers contribute to this trend.', 'The US population is projected to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace, especially after 2030. Census forecasts suggest an increase of 79 million people by 2060, with the population surpassing 400 million by 2058. It has been projected that immigration will be the largest contributing factor to the US population growth, surpassing the natural increase after 2030. Simultaneously, a natural decrease in the country’s population will be supported by declining fertility rates and an aging population.', 'Arthimedes/Shutterstock.com', 'We compiled a list of the 19 most densely populated states in the US, using average population per square mile data from the US Census Bureau.

That's partly because maintaining a healthy dividend requires a solid underlying business. And investors who reinvest those dividends can significantly boost their long-term returns."", 'That said, not every company that pays a dividend is capable of consistency.

Two that are unlikely to do either of those things anytime soon are Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT).', ""Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories have incredible track records when it comes to boosting their payouts. Both are Dividend Kings -- companies that have raised their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.

There are plenty of opportunities in the field. So Johnson & Johnson's innovative qualities look strong, and so does its future."", 'Abbott Laboratories, meanwhile, boasts a vast portfolio of medical devices and routinely launches new ones. Last year, it announced 10 new product approvals. The company has several avenues for growth, none more exciting than its continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) FreeStyle Libre franchise. CGM systems allow diabetes patients to stay on top of their blood sugar levels. Increased adoption of this innovative technology has been an important growth driver for Abbott.', 'Yet the company estimates that more than 500 million adults in the world now live with diabetes.

This could mean lower revenue from those medicines for the companies that make them. Two of Johnson & Johnson's blockbuster products were among the 10 set for price negotiations in the first round. However, the company's ability to develop newer drugs and the diversification its medtech division affords it should allow it to deal with this challenge just fine over the long run."", ""Abbott Laboratories has dealt with somewhat slow revenue growth in recent years as the pandemic disrupted its operations. Some investors are also worried about the effect the rising use of weight-loss drugs like Wegovy will have on its diabetes care segment. None of these are particularly concerning. Abbott's revenue actually declined in 2023 -- its top line dropped by 8.1% to $40 billion -- but excluding sales of its coronavirus diagnostic products, sales increased by 11.6%. These dynamics won't affect Abbott's results forever, nor will the rise of weight-loss medicines. As the company argues, diabetes patients tend to use CGM devices in conjunction with anti-obesity drugs. Further, Abbott Laboratories is looking for other ways to serve the increasing number of patients who take weight-loss medications."", ""Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories have incredible dividend-raising track records, solid businesses, strong innovative abilities, and excellent growth prospects in an industry that will only continue to grow.

Notably, GLP-1 drugs emerged as effective weight loss treatments, boosting leading developers Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). However, many companies struggled due to tough year-over-year comparisons after revenue from vaccines and therapeutics surged past $100 billion in 2022 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, an announcement by Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) regarding cardiovascular benefits in their GLP-1 SELECT trial triggered a sell-off, erasing gains and resulting in negative returns for the sub-sector.

This is largely due to the substantial contribution these stocks make to overall market returns over extended periods. Data from 1926 to July 2023 indicates that dividend income constituted 32% of the monthly total return of the S&P 500, with the remainder attributed to capital appreciation. Moreover, dividends have demonstrated resilience during periods of high inflation. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, in decades marked by significant inflation, such as the 1940s and 1970s, dividend income accounted for more than half of the total return.', 'According to a study conducted by Wisdom Tree, dividend-paying stocks have been highlighted as capable of producing significant levels of income. The report indicated that by emphasizing dividends, investors can substantially enhance their dividend earnings and potentially raise the trailing 12-month dividend yield. This strategy becomes particularly valuable in times of low yields and returns, marked by market volatility and uncertainty. Investing in dividend-weighted indexes could offer investors a means to generate essential income in such challenging environments.', 'Experienced investors, along with regular investors, stress the significance of including dividend-paying stocks in investment portfolios to ensure a steady income stream. Brian Bollinger, the president of Simply Safe Dividends, discussed the role of dividends in generating income during an interview with CNBC. He suggested that for those seeking genuinely passive income, dividend investing is a viable option. While relying on dividends for income is a common practice for retirees or those approaching retirement age, Bollinger emphasized that anyone can construct a portfolio focused on generating income from equities. He further highlighted the importance of building a source of income independent of traditional paychecks.', 'Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), Walmart Inc.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recently hit all-time highs. Though that's pretty exciting, bull markets don't last forever. Equities that can perform well in good times are great. Those that can perform well over the long run, through bull and bear markets, economic peaks and lows, are even better."", ""Let's look at two excellent stocks that ought to deliver solid returns well beyond the current bull market: Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) and Merck (NYSE: MRK)."", ""Medtronic is a leading medical device company. The healthcare giant has a vast portfolio of dozens of products across four main therapeutic areas: diabetes care, cardiovascular health, neuroscience, and medical surgical. Medtronic also does business in more than 150 countries. While diversification can have drawbacks -- it can spread a company's resources too thin -- it also has its perks. Medtronic's diversified operations can allow it to perform reasonably well overall even when certain parts of its business aren't."", ""During the early days of the pandemic, the volume of elective surgeries dropped, leading to lower sales for some of Medtronic's products. The medical device specialist partly weathered the storm by ramping up the sale of mechanical ventilators that were vital in helping many critically ill patients deal with COVID-19. Still, even the pandemic aside, Medtronic's revenue and earnings haven't been growing particularly fast in recent years."", ""That's why the company is doubling down on high-growth areas. Diabetes care is one of them. There is a dire need for innovative products to help people manage this chronic health condition. Last year, Medtronic earned approval for the MiniMed 780G in the U.S., an insulin pump with several exciting features, including meal detection technology (the pump adjusts insulin levels as often as every five minutes based on various factors)."", 'According to the company, the MiniMed 780G grabbed the top spot among insulin pumps in customer satisfaction. Medtronic isn\'t done innovating in this field. As CEO Geoff Martha recently said: ""There is definitely more work to be done as we work to bring to market an even more robust ecosystem of differentiated technology for people living with diabetes, including next-generation durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors, and algorithms.""', 'There are many other growth areas for Medtronic to capitalize on. And, of course, the healthcare giant remains an excellent dividend stock. The company has raised its payouts for 46 consecutive years. It should become a Dividend King in the next few years. Be it for dividends or stability, Medtronic is an excellent choice considering its solid position in the healthcare industry and its proven innovative qualities.', ""Merck is going through some changes. The company's most important product, cancer drug Keytruda, was the top-selling drug in the world last year, but it will run into a patent cliff by 2028. Yes, that's still a few years away, and Keytruda's sales should continue growing until then. But replacing a medicine like Keytruda, whose annual sales exceed $20 billion -- a rarity in the industry -- takes considerable planning."", 'Merck has ramped up its pipeline, partly through acquisitions, to compensate. The company is expecting an important approval this year for sotatercept, a potential treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, high blood pressure in the lungs). Sotatercept has a novel mechanism of action, and unlike other PAH therapies, targets the underlying causes of the disease.', ""But sotatercept won't replace Keytruda all by itself.\xa0Some analysts estimate it will reach peak annual sales between $3 billion and $4 billion. Still, the point is, Merck is planning to add other blockbusters to its lineup. It moved eight brand-new products to phase 3 studies last year. There will be several vital approvals before Keytruda's patent exclusivity runs out. Given the company's innovative potential, Merck's biggest patent cliff shouldn't be a death sentence."", ""Meanwhile, Merck's financial results should move in the right direction. Last year, the company's revenue of $60.1 billion increased by just 1% year over year, though it was dragged down by a massive decline in sales of the company's COVID-19 therapy, Lagevrio. Excluding this product, revenue rose 9% year over year. The pharmaceutical giant is an excellent dividend stock, too."", ""Though the future might seem a bit scary because of Keytruda's patent cliff, patience should translate to robust returns for investors who hold Merck's shares for a long time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Medtronic wasn’t one of them.

This move is driven by the desire among investors to seek refuge from the effects of heightened interest rates. This observation isn't merely theoretical; some instances demonstrate the superior performance of high-dividend stocks during these periods. According to a report from Global X, as referenced in our article titled 10 Highest Dividend-Paying Stocks in the S&P 500, it was revealed that high-yielding dividend stocks have exhibited superior performance compared to the broader market during periods of elevated interest rates spanning from 1960 to 2017. The report further highlighted that high-dividend stocks outperformed the S&P 500 in 7 out of 10 instances since 1960."", 'Various other reports highlighted the significance of high-dividend stocks over the course of the long term. Historical data from Eugene Fama and Kenneth French suggested that high-dividend-paying stocks have tended to offer greater protection during market downturns compared to those with lower or no dividend payouts. These higher dividend-paying stocks have demonstrated a more favorable 30-year downside capture for a period ending in 2020, experiencing notably smaller losses relative to the S&P 500 Index compared to their counterparts with lower dividend yields. Generally, dividends serve as a marker of stability for companies, with many firms reinstating dividends after significant cuts in 2020, highlighting their commitment to long-term financial health.', ""That said, some analysts don't buy into the idea that higher yields always mean better investments. They're more interested in companies that consistently grow their dividends. Dennis DeBusschere, the chief market strategist at 22V Research, shared his perspective with Barron's, emphasizing the importance of focusing on companies capable of increasing their dividend payouts in the face of a higher interest rate environment. To this end, he curated a list of 50 such companies for his clients. These companies boast sustainable dividend growth, with an average yield of approximately 2.6%. They also distribute less than half of their net income as dividends and are projected to achieve an earnings growth rate of about 8% annually over the next few years. He further said that investors should prioritize stocks of higher quality with lower dividend yields and stronger financial indicators instead of solely chasing after the allure of higher dividend payments. This strategic approach will likely result in a more robust and rewarding portfolio in the long run."", 'Our research indicates that while it may not be readily apparent, high dividend yields and consistent dividend growth can indeed coexist.

Although the sector lagged behind others like technology and communication services, there were opportunities for significant growth. As per BlackRock’s latest report, within the pharmaceutical sub-sector, performance varied widely. Notably, GLP-1 drugs emerged as effective weight loss treatments, boosting leading developers Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). However, many companies struggled due to tough year-over-year comparisons after revenue from vaccines and therapeutics surged past $100 billion in 2022 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In the medical device and supplies sector, easing supply constraints and a return to elective procedures led to 7% returns by August 1, 2023. However, an announcement by Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) regarding cardiovascular benefits in their GLP-1 SELECT trial triggered a sell-off, erasing gains and resulting in negative returns for the sub-sector.

However, distributors saw improvements in fundamentals and the resolution of opioid litigation issues.', 'The global healthcare sector faces another year of significant change and challenges in 2024. Providers worldwide are grappling with ongoing labor shortages and rising costs stemming from the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is optimism fueled by the broader adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence, which hold promise in addressing some of these issues. Despite this, the ongoing existence of health disparities poses additional challenges and financial burdens for the healthcare sector in 2024. If not adequately tackled, Deloitte forecasts that these inequities could lead to a threefold increase in costs, reaching $1 trillion by 2040, equating to roughly US$3,000 annually per individual.', 'On a positive note, the integration of AI and machine learning technologies offers potential solutions to these disparities, provided providers address trust and bias issues. Moreover, the pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote technologies and telemedicine, transforming the delivery and nature of healthcare. Providers are extending care beyond traditional medical services to include holistic social care, recognizing the profound impact of social determinants on overall well-being. Consequently, there is a push to integrate social care into public health systems to address multifaceted patient needs.

For example, the Company’s value-based care programs provide more preventative care opportunities and home-based care visits for patients which helps save the U.S. healthcare system billions in unnecessary spending while also providing patients with better outcomes, as diseases and behaviors are caught or corrected at earlier stages.

HII recently secured a modification contract to conduct research and development of advanced submarine technologies for current and future submarine platforms. The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Valued at $33.2 million, this contract is projected to be completed by October 2025. Work related to this contract will be carried out in Newport News, VA.', 'The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly aimed at upgrading and building defense systems. To this end, military submarines with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form an integral part of any nation’s defense system.Therefore, the increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit Huntington Ingalls, with its Newport News Shipbuilding (“NNS”) division being one of the only two contractors in the United States that can construct nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. The company’s product portfolio includes the Columbia-class (SSBN) and Virginia-class (SSN) submarines. Notably, from 1960 to Dec 31, 2023, NNS delivered 63 submarines to the U.S. Navy, comprising 49 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines.Of the 49 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 23 were delivered by NNS. This reflects the solid demand that HII’s submarine programs enjoy in the U.S. defense space, which, along with the rising demand for submarines, should fetch notable order flows for HII. This should substantially benefit the company and boost its revenue generation prospects from the NSS business unit, which recorded a year-over-year improvement of 4.8% in revenues in 2023.', 'Nations are investing heavily in submarines to upgrade their sea warfare capabilities. Per a report by the Research and Markets firm, the global submarine market is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 4.3% during 2024-2028.

With that, it's my pleasure to introduce Thomas to begin today's presentation."", ""Thomas Lingelbach: Thank you so much, Josh, and welcome to today's earnings call. Yes, the year 2023 was not a year without challenges, but also a year with many achievements we are proud of. We made excellent progress across our R&D pipeline. And of course, 2023 was our chikungunya year. We got FDA approval for the world's only and first chikungunya vaccine and very recently, ACIP recommendation and respective adoptions. We enrolled the Phase III study with Pfizer on Lyme completely. And we are just about to reentering Phase I with the second-generation Zika vaccine. And I'm going to go into more details on all of these programs. We have seen significant growth of our commercial business. Our product has surpassed prepandemic sales by 12% and 2022 sales by 26%."", 'Both IXIARO and DUKORAL, our proprietary brands grew more than 70%, respectively, versus 2022. And overall, products, they grew 63% versus 2022, excluding the COVID-19 sales and Peter will go into much more detail. We have solidly funded with a strong midterm financial outlook. We had more than €120 million cash at year-end. We augmented that with close to €100 million as proceeds from our PRV sales early this year. And very recently, we extended the repayment of our interest-only period of the existing loan facility, which, of course, results in a significantly lower cash burn for the company. The operational business is, therefore, considered sufficiently funded, excluding debt repayment, of course, at a certain point in time, until the Lyme commercial revenues enable a sustained profitability for Valneva.', 'When we look at the business in more detail, I would like to start this time with our strategy. Where do we see this company going? And as we have said already more than 10 years ago when we created Valneva, our strategy is to become a globally recognized vaccine company, fully integrated, focused on the development, manufacturing and commercialization of vaccines in areas of unmet medical needs, contributing to our vision to a world where no one die or suffers from a vaccine-preventable disease. We see our strategy in 3 key pillars: number one, driving commercial growth. With the recent approval of IXCHIQ in the United States and our expected forthcoming approvals in other territories, we see really the opportunity to unlock IXCHIQ value by building awareness and market and growing.', 'We hereby capitalize on the bundling effect within our existing travel business. We will further expand global reach more addressing low medium-income countries through partnerships, and with a change in the overall setting and the portfolio and more focus on proprietary products, we see really cash flow positivity from the commercial business 2025 onwards. The second pillar is to capture our R&D upside. We will continue investing in new vaccines that address high unmet medical needs, and we will leverage our proven R&D engine and strategic partnerships. And we believe we are well positioned to do that, having developed 3 vaccines in the meantime from early discovery to licensure. We will continue focusing on vaccines that can make a difference.', ""First, only, best, and we will generate meaningful catalysts for our investors, targeting the next Phase III entry post Lyme. We will maximize our integrated business model. We believe we are one of the very few companies left in the group vaccine space that can really build on an integrated model. So which means we will build continual value from R&D and commercial execution. We will support the timely approvals of our Lyme vaccine, which we continue to see as the single largest catalyst going forward. And by doing so, we see the possibility to achieve sustained profitability with potential successful commercialization and revenues on Lyme from our partner, Pfizer. When we look at IXCHIQ, the world's first and only chikungunya vaccine. It's FDA proved in adults, more additional regulatory approvals are expected this year."", ""It's a life attenuated vaccine that offers strong and long-lasting protection from a single shot, and we target a minimum of 5 years here. The FDA approval triggered also the PRV, which we sold, as I mentioned earlier, and the ACIP recommended the vaccine for certain travelers and laboratory workers. The U.S. launch is well underway, and we are selling through our existing and proven commercial infrastructure. Going forward, we see 3 key segments in terms of market opportunity. One, of course, travelers, military, but also an opportunity for stockpiles given that chikungunya is on the list of potential outbreak preparedness of diseases. We will continue leveraging partnerships for Latin America and other LMICs. And with more visibility on the travel sector, the awareness around chikungunya, the market opportunity around chikungunya, we clearly see that the global market for chikungunya vaccine will exceed €0.5 billion with probably €300 million to €400 million represented alone by the segment I was talking about earlier."", 'In terms of upcoming milestones, I mentioned the additional anticipated approvals EMA, Health Canada and Anvisa in Brazil. And we will, of course, also initiate the regulatory process in the U.K. Towards the latter part of this year, we will further go through the clinical development mainly the Phase IV clinical program, but also other clinical activities, e.g. in the pediatric field. And as we generate more and more data, we will undergo filings for a potential label expansion. I mentioned already that our CHIK vaccine has a very differentiated target profile. It shows a rapid and long-lasting immunity across all age groups tested. And here, I would like to specifically point out that the vaccine has very, very high sero protection levels, including the most vulnerable population, namely elderly above 65 years of age, which has been specifically mentioned in the CDC adopted ACIP recommendation.', ""We have close to 100% seroresponse rates after the single vaccination and this has been maintained at a very high level over time. We got data already up to 2 years, we will generate data up to 3 years. And on safety, the vaccine is generally well tolerated. Of course, it is a life-attenuated vaccine, life attenuated vaccines has the advantage that with a single shot, you have a very long protection, but there is a certain level of [indiscernible], but this is absolutely in line with other well-established life attenuated vaccine in the market. We recorded adolescent trial data, and this data suggests a favorable safety profile regardless of previous CHIKV infection. Turning to our Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15. It is today the world's leading vaccine candidate against Lyme disease."", ""It's the only program in advanced clinical development today. By way of reminder, it is a multivalent recombinant protein-based vaccine that targets the 6 most prevalent serotypes of Lyme borreliosis in the Northern Hemisphere, it follows a proven, established and validated mode of action. We got U.S. FDA Fast Track designation. And as I mentioned at the beginning, the Phase III pivotal efficacy study is now fully enrolled. The program is partnered with Pfizer. They have an exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize this product, and we anticipate the market opportunity to be north of $1 billion. We have already received under the partnership with Pfizer, a certain milestone payments. But overall, we are eligible for milestones up to $408 million."", 'And upon successful commercialization tiered royalties from 14% to 22%. When we look at the upcoming milestones, which are in the short term or execution related, of course, we will, and this is an important point when we talk later about the financials, complete our financial contributions to Pfizer in the first half this year. Then on the execution side, we expect a complete full vaccination for Cohort 1 and the primary vaccination for the Cohort 2, meaning the Cohort 1 will have received 3 doses primary plus dose booster. We will later in the year, see the 2-year antibody consistent and booster results, which will give us a better indication as to whether this vaccine will require an annual booster later or not. And as guided many, many times, we expect efficacy results from the Phase III trial at the end of 2025 which and if successful, will support regulatory filings, which we currently foresee in parallel in the United States and Europe in 2026.', 'Slide 12 of the presentation shows one more time the Phase III efficacy study design. You remember that following initial operational issues, we split it in 2 cohorts, but within 1 study, roughly 50-50. We have now enrolled more than 9,000 participants. The study is randomized 1:1 vaccine against placebo, 2:1 North America versus EU. And the primary endpoint is the rate of confirmed Lyme disease cases after 2 consecutive tick seasons. And when I mentioned earlier, full vaccination to be expected for Cohort 1 is imminent and then of course for Cohort 2, the booster vaccination will come next year. Turning to Zika. I mentioned at the beginning that we have decided to reenter clinical development of Zika vaccine. We are leveraging what we call our optimized second-generation platform, which is a platform that originates from our Japanese encephalitis vaccine IXIARO, got further than extended and optimized for our COVID VLA2001.', 'And we believe that this second-generation adjuvanted inactivated whole-virus vaccine platform is perfectly suited for Zika. And so Zika is as many of you know, also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. We all have experienced and have seen the devastating impact that Zika infection can cause. And today, there are no vaccines or specific treatments available. It is a PRV eligible disease, and there is potential funding from public institutions. And we see there are clearly opportunities given the emerging epidemiology around Zika. In terms of next milestones, we will execute the Phase I clinical trial with the enhanced process and optimized vaccine formulation. And then we will decide on the further development strategy, considering the results, of course, more insights around the market opportunities and external nondilutive funding.', 'With this update on the business, I would like to hand over to Peter to provide us with the financial report.', ""Peter Buhler: Thank you, Thomas. Good morning or good afternoon to all of you. Now let's look at the financial review of our fiscal year 2023. Total product sales surpassed prepandemic levels by 12%, reaching €144.6 million towards the upper range of our sales guidance. This represents an increase of 26% versus prior year. 2023 product sales included €5.7 million in sales of our COVID-19 vaccine, VLA2001, which was discontinued in 2022. We do not expect further COVID sales from 2024 onwards. Product sales, excluding VLA2001 reached €138.9 million, an increase of 63%. This increase was driven primarily by substantial growth of our proprietary travel vaccines. Looking in more detail, IXIARO sales reached €73.5 million, an increase of 78% versus prior year primarily the result of the continued struggle market recovery as well as price increases."", 'As at the end of September 2023, we signed a new 1-year contract with the U.S. Department of Defense worth a minimum of €32 million, of which a bit more than half is included in our 2023 sales. DUKORAL sales reached €29.8 million compared to €17.3 million in 2022 an increase of 72%. Similar to IXIARO, DUKORAL benefited from significant recovery in the private and travel market, particularly in Canada, where there is a strong overlap between travelers to regions of high ETEC travelers, the vaccines approved indication in this country. Third-party product sales increased by 34% to reach €35.7 million for the fiscal year 2023, which was mainly driven by sales under our distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic. The very positive sales performance continues to be, as I already mentioned, related to the recovery of global travel markets, several of which have reached our even exceeded pre-COVID levels, and we expect this trend to continue.', 'Moving on to Slide 17, looking at the P&L. We already covered product sales. Other revenues, including revenues from collaboration, licensing and services have now returned to the historic levels at €9.1 million compared to 2022, which, as you can see, included substantial one-off noncash revenues related to COVID. Looking at expense, we observed a significant decrease in cost of goods, and this is again mainly the result of one-off effects related to the wind down of our COVID-19 program. Research and development expenses decreased sharply from €104.9 million in 2022 to €59.9 million in 2023, which was driven solely by the lower spend on COVID-19 vaccine. 2023 expenses were just below our guidance range of €60 million to €70 million.', ""At the same time, costs related to the Zika vaccine candidate increased as the company plans to reinitiate clinical development imminently. As we ramped up our preparation for IXCHIQ, our marketing and distribution expense increased from €23.5 million in 2022 to €48.8 million in 2023, of which €20.7 million were associated with launch preparations versus only €7.3 million in 2022. G&A expense increased from €34.1 million in 2022 to €47.8 million in 2023. In 2022, all expense lines benefited from a substantial noncash adjustment related to the positive effect of the costs related to the company's share-based compensation due to the share price performance. Our G&A costs were also unfavorably impacted by higher compliance cost relates to our U.S. listing and one-off recruiting costs."", 'Other income increased to €21.5 million in 2023 from €12.2 million in the prior year, primarily due to grant income received from Scottish Enterprise and the gain from settlement with a supplier related to our COVID activities. In 2023, Valneva substantially reduced its operating losses to €82.1 million compared to €113.4 million in 2022 which again was negatively impacted by nonrecurring expenses related to the wind down of our COVID program. Adjusted EBITDA loss was nearly unchanged year-over-year at €65.2 million versus €69.2 million in 2022. Now moving on to financial outlook on Slide 19. With the addition of IXCHIQ to our travel vaccine portfolio and with the continued growth we anticipate from our existing products, we expect our commercial business to deliver substantial growth over the midterm.', 'Based on current assumptions, we are targeting an approximately 2x sales growth in the next 3 years. This will be driven by a differentiated and highly competitive products, IXIARO, which is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine approved in the U.S. and Europe and the mandatory vaccine for U.S. troops depot to Asia. IXCHIQ the first and only approved chikungunya vaccine and DUKORAL, the only Cholera vaccine with an additional approval for ETEC in key markets. Next slide, please. We have raised our 2024 product sales guidance since our February announcement, now estimated between €160 million to €180 million in product sales versus previously €150 million to €180 million. This revised estimate takes into account an improved outlook regarding anticipated IXIARO supply constraints and still assumes approximately 20% to 30% reduction in third-party sales this year, driven by external supply constraints.', ""This brings us to a total revenue estimate of €170 million to €190 million in 2024. We now expect higher other income compared to our announcement in February, moving from €95 million to €105 million to €100 million, €110 million, largely reflecting the €95 million in proceeds from the sale of the chikungunya PRV. We also lowered and narrowed our research and development expense guidance from between €65 million and €90 million to between €60 million and €75 million. This was based on additional visibility for our chikungunya, CHIK -- Zika-related expenses as well as an expected non-dilutive contribution from institutions in connection with chikungunya activities and the product tech transfers to Valneva new -- Valneva's new Almeida manufacturing facility in Scotland."", ""As Thomas mentioned, we ended the year with €126.1 million in cash, which was further augmented by €95 million in proceeds from the PRV sale. This puts us in a very strong position as we expect to work significantly less cash in 2024. This is driven by a few factors, primarily the fact that we expect to complete our contribution to the ongoing Phase III study for VLA15 in the first half of this year. Secondly, with continued revenue growth for IXIARO and DUKORAL and improved efficiency in our manufacturing processes, we expect our commercial business, including IXCHIQ to be cash positive this year, and it has -- as it has been prepandemic, and we anticipate significant further growth going forward. I'm now handing back to Thomas to complete the midyear outlook."", 'Thomas Lingelbach: Thank you so much, Peter. Yes. So it is important that we address also many, many questions that we have received in the market about the more midterm prospects of our business and where we see this business going, which is also why I started the presentation by reminding everyone of the Valneva trajectory. When we look this more completely into a midterm outlook, Peter mentioned that the proprietary business, excluding IXCHIQ will already be cash flow positive this year, including IXCHIQ, we expect the commercial business to contribute cash and help financing our R&D from 2025 onwards. This is driven by continued travel sales growth for IXIARO and DUKORAL, and we see, especially for IXIARO, a double-digit year-on-year CAGR for at least next 3 years.', 'We expect IXCHIQ sales to exceed €100 million in year 3 of launch, and this even assumes a competitive product entry. We will stay focused and strategic with regards to our investments in R&D and our objective is clearly to provide our shareholders and everyone who can benefit from novel innovative vaccines with a new program to enter Phase III once Lyme has completed its Phase III. We see substantial gross margin improvement as we are focusing on proprietary sales. The majority of our third-party product sales, especially the collaboration with BN...', 'Operator: [Technical Difficulty] Please standby. Your conference will resume shortly.', 'Thomas Lingelbach: Hello, can you hear me?', 'Operator: We can hear you. Go ahead.', 'Thomas Lingelbach: We expect gross margin improvement significantly, as I said, as we are focusing on proprietary sales. And we are improving substantially our manufacturing efficiency by leveraging our new facilities and predominantly the facility in Scotland, Almeida. And as Peter mentioned, especially for chikungunya, but also for others, we expect sizable non-dilutive funding, helping us to finance CRE. When we look at the upcoming catalysts and news flow in the short term, on chikungunya, we expect to initiate a Phase III in immunocompromised individuals still in the first half of this year. We talked in length about the upcoming potential approval by EMA, Health Canada, Anvisa. We will file for potential label extension as we generate more data and we have to reminder, we generated already data for the 12 to 18 year olds in Brazil, and we will initiate our Phase IV clinical program.', ""With regards to Lyme, as I mentioned earlier, on the VALOR side, we expect to complete the booster vaccination for Cohort 1 in the second quarter, then the initial 3-dose primary vaccination for the Cohort 2 as well in this -- in the first part of this year. And then, as Peter mentioned, we complete our financial contributions to Pfizer's Phase III trial costs in the first half of this year. And then later this year, the Phase II year antibody persistence and put the results data, which will help us getting a better understanding about the necessity for potential annual boosters for this vaccine once implemented. With regards to additional news flow, we do expect a new U.S. Department of Defense supply contracts in the second half of this year."", 'And we will give more clarity on our R&D pipeline as we go along in 2024. With that, I would like to hand back to the operator to take your questions.', 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Max Herrmann from Stifel.', 'See also 11 Best Energy ETFs: Top Oil, Gas and Renewable Energy Funds and 15 Highest Quality Rice Brands in 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

But tax law is still catching up when it comes to how best to report this income.', 'If you’re a freelancer or gig worker who receives payments via apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App or PayPal, your tax reporting requirements will change for the 2024 tax year.

If you can’t get one in a timely manner, the IRS says to zero out the income on your tax return with the description “Form 1099-K Received in Error.” The line appears on Form 1040 - Additional Income and Adjustments to Income. There, you should write, as follows: ""Part I – Line 8z – Other Income – Form 1099-K Received in Error.""', 'WHY DID THE IRS DELAY IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGE FOR A SECOND YEAR IN A ROW?', 'The change, which had been set to take effect this year, was delayed again in November.

Additionally, the system includes sites such as National Monuments, National Seashores, and National Historic Sites, among others.

The top 15 national parks collectively accounted for approximately 67% of visitor traffic in 2022, whereas the bottom 15 parks received only 1.73% of all visits. This disparity can be attributed to the geographical isolation and lack of tourist infrastructure in these lesser-known parks.', 'The purpose of safeguarding specific areas is to allow nature to flourish without human intervention. However, many individuals opt for less-populated national parks to escape the crowds and challenges associated with popular tourist destinations. Despite being equally stunning, these lesser-known parks are often more secluded. Among the least visited US national parks, three are located on remote islands, and five are in Alaska, making them difficult to access. However, for those in search of a tranquil vacation, these remote parks provide an ideal retreat. The National Park Foundation (NPF) depends on corporate partnerships to support the efforts of the National Park Service (NPS) in conserving vital historical sites and natural scenery.

This spending supported 43,661 jobs and had a total economic impact of $5.6 billion. Of this, visits to the various national parks in Alaska contributed $1.16 billion from 2.023 million visitors in 2022. Indirectly, the NPS created 16,450 jobs and contributed $1.785 billion to the Alaskan economy.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Snap-on's  ROE."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' View our latest analysis for Snap-on ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Snap-on is:', '20% = US$1.0b ÷ US$5.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.20."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""At first glance, Snap-on seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 12%. Probably as a result of this, Snap-on was able to see a decent growth of 9.9% over the last five years."", ""As a next step, we compared Snap-on's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 7.4%."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is SNA fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""With a three-year median payout ratio of 34% (implying that the company retains 66% of its profits), it seems that Snap-on is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered."", ""Additionally, Snap-on has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 38%. As a result, Snap-on's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 19% for future ROE."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Snap-on's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

During CEO Jensen Huang\'s keynote address on Monday, he introduced the long-awaited Blackwell architecture. He called the new flagship processor, the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, the ""world\'s most powerful chip"" for AI.', ""Beyond the industry-leading technical specifications, a revelation on Tuesday is being viewed as a blow to rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and could significantly hamper the company's AI aspirations."", 'There were great expectations regarding Nvidia\'s Blackwell architecture, and the company did not disappoint. The Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) boasts 208 billion transistors -- up from 80 billion for its predecessor. The GB200 combines a Grace Hopper CPU (central processing unit) with two B200 Tensor Core GPUs and a lightning-fast chip-to-chip link to form a ""single, unified GPU.""', 'Nvidia also introduced the GB200 NVL72, a ""multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale system ... which combines 36 Grace Blackwell Superchips, which include 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVLink."" The company notes that its rack-scale system provides up to 30 times the performance while reducing energy consumption by 25 times.', 'The technical capabilities of the Blackwell processors alone will make life more difficult for AMD, but Nvidia is going even further to outpace its competitor.', ""There's a long-standing rivalry between Nvidia and AMD, as the companies have historically jockeyed for position to dominate the GPU space.\xa0For example, at an event to introduce its Instinct MI300X AI chip in early December, AMD went to great lengths to show that its flagship processor outperformed its nearest competitor, Nvidia's year-old H100, using a wide variety of benchmarks."", 'Soon after, Nvidia dropped a blog post that took issue with the claims, noting that AMD purposefully didn\'t use Nvidia\'s optimized software, which skewed the results in AMD\'s favor. Nvidia noted that if it was benchmarked properly, the H100 was ""2x faster.""', ""One area in which the rivals haven't historically competed is price. Despite AMD's protestations to the contrary, Nvidia has long been acknowledged as the industry leader, though AMD's comparable chips are much less expensive. A report released last month suggests that while AMD's top-of-the-line MI300X chips cost between $10,000 and $15,000 each, Nvidia's H100 sold for as much as $40,000, demonstrating the company's pricing power."", 'In an interview on CNBC, Huang revealed that the Blackwell GPUs, expected to ship later this year, would be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, suggesting the next-generation processors will be priced similarly or at a modest premium to its current processor -- the H100.', 'Nvidia\'s aggressive pricing strategy was a surprise to analysts who cover the stock. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore noted that Nvidia is pricing its new Blackwell chips ""at more competitive price points than our earlier assumptions ... [which will] likely dent the enthusiasm for alternatives to Nvidia, both merchant and custom silicon.""', 'Mizuho Securities analyst Jordan Klein notes, ""The more modest pricing (for Nvidia\'s Blackwell GPUs) was perceived as positive for (Nvidia) stock ... It opens the door for more customers to buy vs. only the highly concentrated massive capex spenders in cloud hyperscalers and wealthy sovereign nations.""', 'The pricing will give new and existing customers another reason to choose Nvidia over AMD, as the price differential is shrinking.', ""To be clear, AMD has established itself as a worthy, though somewhat distant, competitor. Nvidia's newest processor will certainly up the ante, as will its aggressive pricing policy. There's the possibility that Nvidia could increase its already dominant market share in the AI space or keep its rivals at bay for a while longer."", ""While these moves will certainly put AMD at a disadvantage, it's unlikely that AMD will be going anywhere anytime soon."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

However, investing in a tech company with a reliable dividend can be an excellent way to expand your portfolio, benefiting from a high-growth industry and potential dividend reinvestment.', 'Five of the six most valuable companies in the world are tech firms. The industry generates massive amounts of cash, allowing some larger firms to reward investors with more than just stock growth.', ""While these companies' dividend yields might not compare to some non-tech stocks, they are worth considering along with their stellar share-price appreciation. So here are three dividend-paying tech stocks to buy right now."", ""Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business exploded last year as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the go-to for AI developers worldwide. The company became the first chipmaker to hit a market cap above $1 trillion, with its stock rising 249% in the last year."", 'The company paid its first dividend in 2013 and increased it every year until November 2018. Its dividend remained at $0.16 until May 2021. A 4-for-1 stock split the same year brought its quarterly dividend proportionally down to $0.04 per share for a 0.02% yield, where it currently stands.', ""However, it remains an attractive dividend-paying tech stock. When companies like Amazon and Alphabet have no dividends, Nvidia's impressive stock growth, alongside even a small dividend, makes its stock worth buying."", ""Nvidia's quarterly revenue climbed 207% over the last year, while operating income has soared 536%. The company is on a promising growth trajectory that will likely see it raise its dividend in the coming years."", 'Data by YCharts', ""Moreover, this chart shows that Nvidia's earnings could hit nearly $36 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 yields a stock price of $1,294, projecting stock growth of 44% over the next two fiscal years."", ""Along with a reliable dividend, Nvidia's stock looks like a no-brainer investment right now."", 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is easily one of the most reliable options in tech, having increased its dividend payout for 19 consecutive years. The company raised its cash amount to $0.75 in 2023, which translates to an annual payout of $3 per share (three times what it was 11 years ago).', ""Consistent dividend growth reflects Microsoft's solid business model. Potent products like Windows, Office, Azure, and Xbox made the company a tech behemoth."", ""The success of these products has seen Microsoft's annual revenue rise 144% over the last decade, with operating income up 217%. Meanwhile, free cash flow has soared 150%, hitting over $67 billion last year."", 'Along with solid financials, there are plenty of reasons to believe Microsoft will continue increasing its dividend. It pays out only about 25% of its earnings in dividends, indicating it could keep growing its dividend even if headwinds arise.', ""Moreover, the company is investing heavily in some of the fastest-growing sectors, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft's lucrative positions in these markets will likely see its earnings continue to soar over the long term."", 'A forward P/E ratio of 36 makes its stock somewhat expensive. However, a dominating role in tech and consistent dividend growth means its stock has likely earned its high valuation and is worth considering right now.', 'Rather than focusing exclusively on high yields, one of the best ways to find dividend stocks is to seek out companies with significant cash resources, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). A focus on high yields could lead you to an investment in a financially struggling business; meanwhile, a cash cow like Apple can almost guarantee dividend growth over the long term.', 'In the last decade, its dividend yield has increased 104%. It rose to $0.24 per quarter in 2023, with a yield of 0.5%. Apple has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years, with its payout requiring only about 15% of its earnings.', ""Apple's yield might not be as impressive as popular dividend stocks like Verizon or Coca-Cola, but sticking with its current dividend growth trajectory could see the payouts double again over the next 10 years. With a stock that has risen 840% since 2014, the company could be one of the smartest long-term investments. "", ""And it's hard to argue with Apple's powerful position in tech. The company hit nearly $107 billion in free cash flow last year thanks to the immense popularity of products like the iPhone, MacBook, and iPad, as well as its many digital services."", ""The company's forward P/E of 27 makes it slightly cheaper than Microsoft but still pricey.

Sales in its infrastructure solutions group (which includes storage, servers, and networking) dropped 12% year over year to $33.9 billion.', ""Given that Dell's IT architecture business is on the decline, and Supermicro is growing like a weed, why do I see Dell as a better investment option?"", 'The chart below illustrates the price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of a number of companies competing in IT networking solutions.', 'At a P/S of 5.5, Supermicro is the most expensive stock in this peer group based on this metric. The next closest is IBM, which is trading at a P/S of nearly half that of Supermicro.', ""The disparity in valuation multiples among Supermicro and its cohorts is tough to ignore. But even with a P/S of 0.9, investors should realize this is much higher than Dell's five-year average."", ""Like many companies even tangentially related to AI, shares of Dell are clearly witnessing some momentum. While I don't see the stock as cheap per se, I am more optimistic about its long-run prospects compared to Supermicro."", 'What concerns me about Supermicro the most is its heavy reliance on Nvidia. While the chipmaker has a strong pulse on accelerated computing, I suspect competition will be on the rise over the next few years.', ""As such, I think it's reasonable that businesses will be outsourcing their data center and chip needs to more than one provider. This could spell decelerating growth for Nvidia, and Supermicro could be affected as a consequence."", ""So while I do not necessarily see exponential growth for Dell in the near term, I think the company's role in integrated IT services will begin to rise. As such, Dell could experience a positive jump and return to more respectable levels of sustained growth in the long term."", ""Given the discount Dell stock trades at compared to Supermicro, I would at least consider buying the former. A prudent strategy could be to monitor Dell's performance over the next couple of quarters -- keeping in mind that AI is going to be a long-term game."", 'If Dell looks to be making inroads against the competition, employing dollar-cost averaging could be a good way to gain exposure to this unique pocket of the AI realm.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dell Technologies wasn’t one of them.

But it was Nvidia's flagship event that drove sentiment for much of the week."", 'Nvidia introduced its next-generation Blackwell architecture, the heir apparent to its wildly successful Hopper processors, which have become the go-to for AI processing. Huang described the B200 graphics processing unit (GPU) as the ""world\'s most powerful chip"" for AI. Its top-tier processor -- the GB200 Superchip -- integrates a Grace CPU and two B200 processors on one board. To make the platform even faster, Nvidia created the new NVLink network switch chip, which expedites communication between the chips, freeing up the main processors to focus on AI.', 'The Blackwell chips will be available in a wide variety of configurations from individual GPUs up to complete rack-scale systems for data centers and everything in between.', 'There were a number of company-specific developments that came out of GTC:', 'Super Micro Computer, commonly referred to as Supermicro, announced the launch of three ""Nvidia-based, full-stack, ready-to-deploy generative AI"" systems that are turnkey ready for processing AI workloads.', 'SoundHound AI revealed it would offer on-chip voice AI on the Nvidia Drive Platform that will deliver in-vehicle generative AI responses, even without a connection to the internet.', 'Beyond the announcements made in conjunction with GTC, there were other company-specific events -- both positive and negative -- that added to the volatility.', 'Supermicro joined the S&P 500 on Monday, which the company said was an acknowledgment of the remarkable growth of its sales and market cap.', 'Supermicro sought to take advantage of its growth with a secondary stock offering of 2 million shares of common stock, which was expected to raise roughly $1.75 billion.', 'A short report by Capybara Research charged that SoundHound AI was ""a failing company peddling lies and deception."" It raised a number of valid concerns, which caught the attention of investors, sending the stock tumbling.', 'One of Wall Street\'s finest also soured on SoundHound. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald issued a rare double downgrade to underweight (sell) this week while assigning a price target of $4.90, roughly 38% below Wednesday\'s closing price. The analysts said the ""valuation cannot be justified"" while also raising some of the same concerns as the short report.', ""In terms of valuation, Supermicro and BigBear.ai are equally inexpensive, both sporting a forward price-to-sales ratio of roughly 2, while SoundHound AI sells for 20 times forward sales. It's also worth noting that SoundHound AI and BigBear.ai have yet to generate a profit.

CDNS.', 'On Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023. Its current level marks the highest in 23 years. Since the beginning of 2024, market participants have been busy predicting when the central bank will cut interest rates for the first time.', 'Recently, a large section of financial researchers and economists were worried about the rate cut as the inflation rate remains sticky supported by a resilient labor market, increasing wage rate and strong consumer spending. However, in a relief to investors, the Fed reiterated the number of interest rate cuts that it had indicated in the December FOMC meeting.', 'Fed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate to come down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.', 'In his post-FOMC statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, “We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this type of cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.”', 'Following the March FOMC decision, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 75% probability that the first rate cut will come in the June FOMC meeting. This probability was 60% just before Powell’s post-FOMC statement.', 'Consequently, Wall Street rallied to record highs. The broad-market index — the S&P 500 — closed at 5,224.62 after hitting an all-time high of 5,226.19. The benchmark closed above 5,200 for the first time. The blue-chip Dow recorded an all-time high of 39,529.13 and a closing high of 39,512.13. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted a new closing high of 16,369.41.', 'Despite its higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. Investment in growth stocks creates wealth over a long period of time.', 'A lower market interest rate will decrease the discount rate, which in turn will raise the net present value of investment. Moreover, many of these companies depend on the chip source of credit for the business to grow.', 'The ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.', 'We believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.', 'We have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $35 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date.

(NYSE:APD) is a leading industrial gas company. Founded in 1940, the Pennsylvania-based company operates in over 50 countries and employs 19,000 people.', 'The company produces and sells atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and argon; process gases such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide); and specialty gases.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with APD.', 'It has a two-pillar growth strategy to expand its core gas business and to build own and operate clean hydrogen projects that will support the energy transition in the heavy-duty transportation and industrial sectors.', 'While Air Products has been around for decades operating in the industrial gases industry, our core investment thesis is based on the growth it is expected to achieve through its production of hydrogen that contributes to global decarbonization goals.', 'Transitioning to clean hydrogen has become an important part of achieving climate goals. The current production of hydrogen, called grey hydrogen, involves a large amount of carbon dioxide emissions. What Air Products aims to focus on is blue and green hydrogen.', 'Blue hydrogen involves the regular production of hydrogen, but with carbon capture and storage limiting emissions. Air Products is one of the few companies that claims to be able to capture 95% of the carbon emissions.', 'Green hydrogen, on the other hand, uses electricity from renewable sources to split water and release hydrogen. Air Products has several green hydrogen projects, including in New York, Texas, Arizona and Saudi Arabia, in partnership with NEOM, which is backed by the government.', 'The other catalyst for growth is the recent policy changes in the U.S. that incentivize the production of clean hydrogen.', 'According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill have introduced clean hydrogen production tax credits that have created a new 10-year incentive for clean hydrogen production of up to $3 per kilogram, depending on the extent of carbon intensity.', 'Air Products CEO Seifi Ghasemi spoke at the JP Morgan Industrial Conference on March 13, where he illustrated the impact of the change. In Louisiana, the incentive to sequester carbon from hydrogen production had an incentive of $45 per ton. After the Inflation Reduction Act, the incentive is now $85 per ton. As a result, the company is increasing its capacity in Louisiana because it is now far more economical to capture carbon and produce blue hydrogen. This is a good example of why Air Products is increasing investments and how its net margin will improve.', 'The company has set aside about $15 billion for international hydrogen-related projects, setting it up for a significant upside in earnings should all the investments materialize. Below is a list of its projects from its first-quarter 2024 earnings presentation, the majority of which are related to the energy transition.', 'Revenue growth reported in the first quarter of 2024 showed a decline of about 6% year over year to $2.99 billion. However, net income was reported at $609.3 million, up almost 6.50%.', 'A major reason for the decline in revenue came from China, which comprises almost 16% of its business. Operating income from the Asia division was down 10%. There was also lower helium demand across the electronics end market in China. The company, however, does not believe there is an issue with its supply, but there may be illegal supplies entering the market that hurt its performance. Furthermore, onsite assets are still expected to contribute positively to performance.', 'The other issues were cost headwinds from the sale of equipment projects and currency devaluation in Argentina.', ""These issues have certainly impacted the company's margins as well, although Air Products continues to maintain margins that are solid compared to industry standards."", ""One of the major issues with the company's financial performance is that its free cash flow margin has fallen off a cliff. Free cash flow turned negative last year at -$1.4 billion because of its aggressive expansion and investment policies."", ""Air Products remains well aware of this, however, and it has charted a course of funding these projects through a mix of equity and debt, which it can raise because of its A rating from Moody's and S&P Global. Below is a snapshot of its capital deployment plans from the most recent earnings report."", 'This, of course, has led to higher debt levels, with the debt-to-equity ratio increasing to 0.86 in the first quarter from 0.62 in the prior-year period. The company is determined, however, to retain its current debt rating and, therefore, has committed to ensure the balance sheet is not overleveraged.', 'On the positive side, Air Products is a dividend aristocrat with a history of consecutively raising its dividend for 42 years. The company raised its quarterly dividend to $1.77 per share from $1.75 in the first quarter. The dividend yield is still quite low at 2.84%, and with all the cash being deployed for expansion, we will not be surprised if it makes minimal increases in the next two years just to retain the aristocrat title. Once the projects materialize and add to the income, however, we are likely to see an improvement in that trend.', 'The GF Value Line suggests a value of $287.14 for 2024, which presents an upside of about 16% as of the time of writing.', 'According to GuruFocus, analysts estimate revenue of $13.22 billion for 2024 and $14.14 billion for 2025, which represent year-over-year increases of 4.92% and 6.96%. The earnings per share estimate for 2024 is $12.49, while the company is guiding for $12.20 to $12.50, which represents an increase of 6% to 9%.', 'The current enterprise value/Ebitda ratio is at 16.61 and the forward EV/Ebitda ratio is 12.48, which is higher than the industry average, mainly because of the debt burden the company is now carrying.', 'Now, as I have mentioned, several projects are coming online in the next few years which should add incremental Ebitda to the company and, for some, the IRA tax credits will improve the profitability. However, these projects are expected to materialize between the second half of 2025 and early 2027, so we are looking at this company as a longer-term investment of at least four to five years.', 'China continues to pose a risk for Air Products, and this could intensify if further tariffs are imposed after the U.S. presidential election later this year. Ghasemi warned on the last earnings call that conditions in China remain far more dire than what is being reported in the news.', 'Another potential risk is a change in U.S. government policies. The Inflation Reduction Act, which has been driven by the Biden administration, could come under scrutiny if there is a change in leadership. This could result in a change to the tax credit structure for hydrogen and weigh on the industrial gas companies.', 'Project cost overruns and high leverage are another concer. Along with revenue and earnings targets, the company puts out yearly capital expenditure estimates. For 2024, the estimate is $5 billion to $5.50 billion. For 2025, the capex estimate is $5.20 billion. I would be worried if the company keeps increasing its estimates significantly as a sign of cost overruns. The company may run out of cash and may not be able to raise financing to complete projects in time. This could lead a significant hit to earnings.', 'The recent sell-off in the stock has reset the valuation and made the current price levels attractive and somewhat undervalued.', 'While Air Products has ambitious growth plans that could lead to reduced free cash flow and higher levels of leverage over the next two to three years, I expect that these will yield returns as the projects materialize over the next five years.', 'Solid, diversified growth prospects and a central role in the future of the energy transition make Air Products an appealing option. Its position in the clean energy movement offers a unique opportunity for diversification.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Heating up, Peltz winning a key backing from proxy advisory firm, institutional shareholder services, otherwise known as ISS. So Julie, yes, ISS saying shareholders should vote for Nelson Peltz at that shareholder meeting coming up on April 3rd. So now we got a showdown because Glass Lewis said shareholders should support the company backed slate of nominees."", 'But ISIS saying no, Mr. Peltz has the experience given his history and other boards best position they say to bring a shareholder perspective.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it's interesting the shares are not moving much today. And makes sense because at this point we're not going to know what the outcome is until April 3rd or shortly thereafter if the votes aren't all counted right away. So that tracks here. It's interesting because there were some other folks who are also supporting Peltz. It's companies who were previously targeted by him. Who said, oh, he's just-- he's a big old pussycat, he's great to work with."", ""They didn't say that exactly. But that--"", 'JOSH LIPTON: That was the gist.', ""JULIE HYMAN: That he seemed scary from far away.

So Ali, what did you make of this headline?"", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: This is pretty surprising, considering what we heard from Glass Lewis earlier this week. And it certainly a big win for Nelson Peltz when you think about such an influential proxy advisory firm coming out in support of him. ISS saying that Peltz could be additive to the board, considering he's a shareholder-- a significant shareholder at the company."", 'In the report, ISS saying, quote ""Peltz with his considerable experience on other boards and fiduciary duties owed to a large shareholder group appears best positioned to bring a shareholder perspective to the board. Now what\'s notable here? Is that ISIS said that shareholders should not vote for trian\'s other nominee, which is Jay Rasulo. He\'s the former CFO at Disney. And they said just Peltz.', ""They also advised shareholders against voting for Blackwell's, not three nominees. That's the other proxy fight Disney's dealing with and that they should withhold their vote against current Disney board member Maria Elena Lagomasino. So the thought being there that Peltz would replace Maria Elena."", ""But going back to earlier this week, Glass Lewis which again supports Disney's current board, they referred to CEO Bob Iger's initiatives at the company and that he's really seemed to turn around the company at this point in time. ISIS did acknowledge. That they said, look, we understand that some shareholders might be fine with the way Disney is operating right now. However, their biggest concern stems from succession and all the drama that happened in 2020."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Which is Peltz's concern too and one of them."", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Which is Peltz is concern too. So in their view, they think Peltz could be someone that perhaps could bring a fresh perspective and could help with succession because that seems to be the biggest overhang of this company. But you were just talking about how Peltz has received some support. Disney has some support as well. Jamie Dimon, George Lucas, the widow of Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs remember was a very close friend of Iger.', ""So we'll see, April 3rd is that shareholder meeting. I think this proxy battle is not going to get resolved before then I think at this point Nelson Peltz wants to take it to the finish line. So we'll have to see what happens."", 'JULIE HYMAN: We will.

(“ISS”), the largest and most influential proxy advisory firm, recommends that Disney shareholders vote “FOR” Nelson Peltz and “WITHHOLD” on Maria Elena Lagomasino on Trian’s BLUE proxy card in connection with Disney’s annual meeting on April 3, 2024.', 'ISS recognizes that Disney has a record of “multi-year underperformance” and emphasizes the need for change on the Disney Board. ISS also states that Nelson Peltz, with his “considerable experience on other boards and fiduciary duties owed to a large shareholding group, appears best positioned to bring a shareholder perspective to the Board.”', ""ISS notes that Mr. Rasulo’s “knowledge of [Disney’s] operations… still appears to serve as a solid basis for understanding the company's current situation.”"", 'In addition to Disney’s significant operational deterioration and stock underperformance, ISS noted Disney has failed to adequately address succession and that the Board would benefit from a shareholder representative to hold management to account and to “provide the catalyst that this board apparently needs to improve its effectiveness.”', ""ISS also recommends that shareholders “WITHHOLD” on Maria Elena Lagomasino, stating that she “bears more accountability than most for the failed succession process prior to Iger's decision to step down in 2020,” and stating that “multi-year concerns surrounding Lagomasino's role as a compensation committee member strengthen the case that Peltz's addition, on balance, would appear a net positive.”"", 'In making its recommendation, ISS also noted the following: Performance', '“[Disney] has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, and five-year periods through Oct. 6, 2023, the last trading day before The Wall Street Journal reported that Trian was preparing to run a proxy fight at the 2024 AGM.”', '“Operational performance over the past five years shows deterioration in margins, free cash flow, and return metrics, as well as increased leverage.”', 'Issues as identified by ISS include “that financially the Fox acquisition was value destructive, that the secular decline in linear networks is an ongoing challenge that needs to be addressed, that the costs within DTC got out of control, that the studio business has underperformed relative to the decade prior to the pandemic, that Parks and Experiences has been a bright spot in earnings and requires ongoing investments to maintain its strength, and the challenge of transitioning ESPN to DTC to address secular decline in linear networks.”', 'Case for Change', ""“[I]ncremental change is needed at the company due to multi-year underperformance of the company's peers and chosen benchmark, operational challenges, and most critically, a repeated failure on the part of the board to oversee the cultivation of a successor to Iger.”"", ""“The importance of executing a successful succession plan, particularly for a company of this complexity, and the board's prior failure to properly oversee this process, suggests that some level of change at the board level is warranted.”"", 'Board Oversight Failures', ""“[T]he key decision points that led to the company's challenges over the past five years, not to mention multiple activist campaigns, can be traced to the board.”"", ""“Chapek seems to have taken enough wrong turns during his tenure (at least by the board's own assessment) that a more engaged board should arguably have recognized these issues sooner.”"", '“[T]he events leading up to the CEO transition in 2020 and the strategic missteps taken over the past several years appear to indicate that the board is not functioning in the most optimal way.”', ""“[T]he sudden firing of Chapek less than five months after extending his contract and the circumstances surrounding the announcement of Chapek's departure and Iger's return appear to indicate that the board was caught by surprise about the state of affairs at the company.”"", 'Succession Planning Failures', '“What remains missing is tangible progress towards succession to give investors sufficient confidence that the company will not run aground after Iger departs, and in doing so, avoid future mutinies.”', '“By definition, the decision to ask a former CEO (especially one who indicated it was time for him to retire) to return to the company to replace a successor whom the board did not adequately vet is evidence of a critically flawed succession process. In [Disney’s] case, shareholders paid a steep price.”', '“[T]he board fell short on two key matters: cultivating a successor to Iger, and preventing Chapek from veering off course after he was appointed.”', ""“[T]here are lingering questions about the board's ability to properly oversee the next CEO transition, whether it happens in 2026 or in later years, and the significant strategic changes the company is undertaking, particularly given the ongoing challenging industry environment.”"", ""“The heir apparent to a CEO role at an iconic consumer-facing American company necessarily faces intense investor, board, and media scrutiny. That the board has not seen fit to put anyone in this position since the departure of Staggs in the first half of 2016 represents as close to a single-issue indictment of a board's performance that one could imagine.”"", 'Trian and its Nominees', '“Trian represents significant share ownership and has presented a detailed case for change and a clear set of goals for the board to consider.”', '“[A] shareholder representative who is well versed in the imperative to hold management to account would be well positioned to provide the catalyst that this board apparently needs to improve its effectiveness.”', '“[Nelson] Peltz, as a significant shareholder, could be additive to the succession process, providing assurance to other investors that the board is properly engaged this time around. He could also help evaluate future capital allocation decisions.”', '“[Mr. Rasulo] came across as levelheaded and demonstrated no sign of resentment or ill will towards Iger.”', '“[We do] not have any concerns about [Mr. Rasulo’s] ability to serve as an objective director.”', 'Maria Elena Lagomasino and Michael B.G. Froman ', '“Neither director targeted by Trian possesses a skill set that is not possessed by a board member, or that could be provided by a specialized consultant were a short-term need to arise.”', ""“As the longest-serving independent member of the board, [Maria Elena] Lagomasino bears more responsibility than any other serving nominee for the failure of the Staggs/Rasulo ‘bakeoff,’ the failure to cultivate a readily apparent successor to Iger following Staggs' departure, and again following Iger's re-entry.”"", ""“During her time on the board, [Maria Elena] Lagomasino has chosen to support four extensions of Iger's tenure as CEO, yet along with her shorter-tenured independent fellow directors, has not yet named a CEO successor.”"", '“As a member of the compensation committee since joining the company [in 2015] (and as chair of the committee since 2019), [Maria Elena] Lagomasino oversaw consecutive years of problematic compensation decisions, resulting in significant shareholder opposition, which the committee failed to promptly address.”', 'To ensure the election of Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo, it is essential that shareholders vote “FOR” Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo, and “WITHHOLD” on Michael B.G.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks that Paid Special Dividends in 2024.\xa0', ""Dividends are already a delectable treat for investors, but special dividends are the cherry on the cake. Companies that offer special dividends distribute significantly higher amounts of money annually than expected. That was precisely the move Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made in 2004. With a cash reserve of over $50 billion, the company distributed a one-time special dividend that was 38 times larger than its regular dividend of $0.08 per share. These special payments frequently coincide with the holiday season and are likened to year-end bonuses, providing investors with an extra financial boost as the new year approaches. In addition to this, these supplemental dividends can have a significant impact on retirement planning, as reported by Forbes. For example, even if an investment's headline yield seems low, like 1.3%, the total return with special dividends could be much higher, around 6%. Similarly, a 4% headline yield might not seem impressive, but with special dividends factored in, the total return could be as high as 11% annually."", ""Special dividends have experienced fluctuations in popularity over time, with certain periods witnessing greater prevalence than others. Research published in the Journal of Financial Economics highlighted this trend, indicating that during the 1940s, a substantial 61.7% of dividend-paying firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) issued at least one special dividend. However, this figure dropped significantly to just 4.9% during the first half of the 1990s. Another research paper published in the Journal of Applied Finance emphasized that a company's choice to issue special dividends is connected to its investment opportunities, particularly focusing on growth prospects available within the current economic conditions. The paper examined different aspects of special dividends using research conducted by diverse financial analysts. According to the paper, special dividends serve as a method for managers to allocate excess cash flow to shareholders, addressing the issue of overinvestment. Erik Lie, a Norwegian finance professor, discovered in The Review of Financial Studies that special dividends act as a constraint on managerial excessive spending. Additionally, May Hu, an Associate Professor at RMIT University, suggested in her research paper that companies giving special dividends during economic downturns demonstrate responsible cash management when investment options are limited."", ""As mentioned earlier, the number of special dividends distributed by US companies has varied over the years. In 2018, there were 48 instances of such dividends paid by S&P 100 companies, followed by a slight decrease to 43 in 2019, according to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, in 2021, there was a notable increase to 54, further escalating to 55 in 2022. Interestingly, in 2023 through June, the count dropped to 36, marking a significant decline compared to the preceding years. That said, on a global scale, investors received a record-breaking $1.66 trillion in dividends in 2023, as reported by Janus Henderson's Global Dividend Index.

However, Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) has gotten left out of the current merger wave washing over the oil patch. ', ""The oil producer has reportedly pursued several acquisition targets, only to lose to a competitor. Because of that, the company won't get the merger-fueled boost its rivals expect to see in their deals. "", ""Here's a look at the deals Devon reportedly missed and potential targets the oil stock could pursue next."", 'In early February, Reuters reported that Devon Energy had approached Enerplus with an acquisition offer. A tie-up with the Canadian oil company would have boosted its position in the oil-rich Bakken of North Dakota and given it a stake in the gas-rich Marcellus. ', ""However, rival Chord Energy swooped in and sealed a deal with Enerplus later that month. The merger will boost Chord's scale, enabling it to save $150 million annually while boosting its free cash flow. "", 'Before that, Devon Energy was reportedly considering a bid for CrownRock to boost its position in the Permian Basin. However, rival Occidental Petroleum agreed to buy CrownRock for $12 billion in December. Occidental expects CrownRock to boost its free cash flow by $1 billion during the first year, assuming oil averages $70 a barrel (about $10 a barrel below the current price point). ', 'The company has also reportedly held merger talks with Marathon Oil. However, those talks have yet to lead to a deal. ', ""Several of Devon's other rivals have found merger partners. Diamondback Energy bought Endeavor Energy Resources in a $26 billion deal to create a leading producer in the Permian Basin. Natural gas producers Chesapeake Energy and Southwestern Energy also agreed to merge in a $7.4 billion deal that will create the country's leading gas producer. Meanwhile, big oil behemoths Exxon and Chevron kicked off the current wave after sealing deals worth roughly $60 billion apiece to buy Pioneer Natural Resources and Hess, respectively. "", 'While Devon has missed out on CrownRock and Enerplus, many options remain. Wall Street analysts who follow the oil industry have highlighted several smaller companies that could be targets for a larger player, including: ', 'Permian Resources: The largest pure-play producer in the Delaware Basin with over 400,000 net acres. ', 'Matador Resources: The company is a leading producer in the Delaware Basin with 152,000 net acres. It also has operations in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville. ', 'HighPeak Energy: The company owns 132,000 acres in the Midland Basin. ', ""Devon Energy could target any of these companies. It has a sizable position in the Delaware Basin side of the Permian that it could enhance by acquiring Permian Resources or Matador.

While many analysts have voiced their skepticism about the Fed’s claim, investors seem to keep looking beyond the rate cuts debate. Market analysts believe the AI-led rally has the potential to further boost stock prices despite valuation concerns. In a fresh note, Wells Fargo analysts said that the S&P 500 valuations are “stretched” by “most measures.” However, they said the stocks could still move higher as companies have higher earnings and revenue growth along with “acceptable” debt levels. Wells Fargo analysts also drew a contrast between the tech bubble of March 2000 and the market rally of today, adding that the market conditions today don’t have resemblance with the tech bubble of the past because of the underlying strengths of companies. However, Wells Fargo analysts did recommend investors to decrease their exposure to sectors like IT, Communications Services and Consumer Discretionary — which they believe are overvalued — and instead invest in undervalued stocks from sectors like Energy, Industrials and Healthcare.', 'UBS in its report after the latest Federal Reserve decision also said that it continues to believe the US economy remains on a healthy track as the firm expects three rate cuts this year starting June.

On Fit for Growth, we continue to expect to generate approximately $1 billion in gross savings and $800 million in savings net of reinvestments by 2025.

This is evident from the terrific gains clocked by the likes of Nvidia, Palantir, Arm Holdings, and Super Micro Computer, among others.', 'Some of these names have seen a parabolic jump in their shares thanks to their improving AI credentials. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is one company that seems set to hop on the AI bandwagon and could go parabolic too.', ""Let's see why that may be the case."", 'Shares of Oracle are up 21% so far this year, but the stock got a major boost last week following the release of its fiscal 2024 third-quarter results on March 11.', ""The stock shot up over 11% in a single session as investors cheered the company's better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the three months ended Feb. 29, 2024. Oracle, which is known for providing database software to enterprises, saw robust growth in its cloud revenue last quarter thanks to the growing demand for AI applications."", 'Cloud revenue jumped 25% year over year to $5.1 billion, while overall revenue was up 7% to $13.3 billion. Non-GAAP earnings surged 16% to $1.41 per share. Oracle is forecasting revenue growth of 4% to 6% in the current quarter.', 'While that may not look very exciting at first, CEO Safra Catz pointed out in the press release that Oracle\'s remaining performance obligations (RPO) jumped 29% year over year to a record $80 billion, driven by ""large new cloud infrastructure contracts"" signed during the quarter. RPO refers to the total value of a company\'s future contractual obligations, so faster growth in this metric as compared to Oracle\'s revenue suggests it\'s winning new business that could supercharge its future results.', 'What\'s more, Catz added that Oracle could ""continue receiving large contracts reserving cloud infrastructure capacity because the demand for our Gen2 AI infrastructure substantially exceeds supply -- despite the fact we are opening new and expanding existing cloud datacenters very, very rapidly."" This capacity expansion will allow Oracle to serve more than 40 new AI-related bookings worth over a billion dollars that it received last quarter.', ""It's also worth noting that Oracle is now looking to push the envelope in the cloud AI infrastructure market by adding new generative AI features that will serve multiple verticals ranging from sales, marketing, and human resources to finance and supply chain. In all, Oracle claims its cloud infrastructure offers more than 50 generative AI use cases to customers."", ""That explains why customers have been flocking to its cloud-based AI offerings and driving solid growth in Oracle's business. The company's cloud revenue grew at a faster pace than Amazon Web Services' 13% year-over-year growth in the previous quarter and was in line with Google Cloud's 25% growth. The company's robust revenue pipeline indicates it could end up giving Microsoft Azure -- which saw 30% cloud growth last quarter -- a run for its money as well."", 'Investors should note the cloud AI market could grow from just $43 billion in 2022 to a whopping $887 billion in 2032. Oracle, therefore, seems to be at the beginning of a major growth curve.', ""Oracle stock is currently trading at 6.7 times sales, while its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sits at 33. For comparison, technology stocks in the U.S. have an average sales multiple of 7.1 and a P/E ratio of almost 45. What's more, Oracle's forward P/E ratio of just 18 also represents a discount to the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 28 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks)."", ""Analysts also expect Oracle's earnings growth to accelerate each year through fiscal 2026."", ""The company's fast-growing AI business could even help it exceed Wall Street's earnings expectations. But assuming Oracle's earnings jump to $7.11 per share in fiscal 2026 and it trades at 31 times trailing earnings at that time (in line with the Nasdaq-100), its stock price could jump to about $220 per share in the next two years. That would be a 70% jump from current levels."", ""However, if the market decides to reward Oracle with a higher valuation on the back of its improving AI prospects, the stock may be able to sustain its recent pop and go parabolic.

As Lam and Applied are both equipment suppliers to the memory industry, and as Rambus supplies ancillary technology to memory installations, Micron's earnings also bode well for these companies' futures over the next one-to-two years at least."", ""In its earnings report last night, Micron reported revenue of $5.82 billion in revenue, beating expectations by nearly $500 million, with adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings of $0.42 trouncing analyst expectations of a $0.28 loss. Not only that, but Micron guided to $6.6 billion in revenue at the midpoint of the current quarter's guidance, far higher than the $6 billion expected by analysts.

That means more and more purchases of machines from Lam Research and Applied Materials."", ""While both companies are set for growth, Lam Research may be in an especially fortuitous position, as it has a large share of process steps used in vertical stacking.

', 'Homeowners insurance is a package policy that typically covers losses and damages to one’s home and personal possessions. Homeowners can also add popular optional coverages such as earthquake, flooding, or water backup coverage. Those who reside near a fault line can benefit from earthquake coverage while water backup coverage can cover losses where water backs up through sewers or drains.', 'Other than the dwelling coverage, homeowners might also need extended replacement cost coverage which allows adding to the dwelling coverage if the base amount is not ample to rebuild, or guaranteed replacement cost coverage under which the homeowner insurance policy covers the cost to rebuild the house. Personal belongings that get stolen or damaged are often covered. Simultaneously, liability coverage takes care of any bodily injury or property damage to others. In case the homeowner is not able to live in the home due to a problem covered by the policy, the additional living expenses coverage pays the extra costs.', 'Accessibility and availability of affordable homeowners insurance in the US is a major concern. A climate insurance bubble was witnessed across the country in 2023, especially affecting risky areas. On March 14, Fortune reported that currently, more than one in four homeowners in the US with insurance seem worried that their homes are going to be uninsurable in 2024, based on a recent ValuePenguin survey. While hikes in homeowners insurance premiums were recorded in 2023, the major reason behind them was climate change. Properties within the country tend to be more damaged once hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and extreme weather conditions take place. A prime example of these circumstances is California, a victim of wildfires and floods, where costs have increased by more than 300% in some places between 2020 and 2023.

Leading insurers such as State Farm and AllState announced to stop offering insurance policies in California. The reasons behind these decisions were cited to be increasing exposure to natural disasters, rising construction and repair costs, and higher frequency of severe weather. The impact of natural catastrophes is immense considering a recent analysis by First Street Foundation, which indicates that 23.9 million American properties face the risk of damaging winds, while 4.4 million properties are vulnerable to wildfire. Flooding is another significant risk for 12 million properties in the US.', 'Major players in the home insurance market include Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB), Erie Indemnity Company (NASDAQ:ERIE), and Aon plc (NYSE:AON).

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

Given that we are looking at Robert Half as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.880. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Although Berkshire has its hands in numerous industries, like insurance, energy, and railroads, individual investors care most about the companies held in its $371 billion public equities portfolio.', ""Look through the dozens of holdings and you'll see that American Express (NYSE: AXP) is the third-largest position in the portfolio. The credit card and banking giant has been a Buffett favorite for a long time, perhaps making it a so-called forever holding for him."", ""Berkshire owns 20.9% of this top financial company's shares outstanding today. But is now the right time to buy American Express for your own portfolio?"", 'Buffett popularized the term ""economic moat."" This just means that a business possesses a trait (or combination of traits) that allows it to successfully fend off competitors for an extended period of time. In the Oracle of Omaha\'s mind, companies that have moats are very high quality, and they\'re a fertile hunting ground to find attractive investment opportunities. ', 'American Express undoubtedly fits the bill here. For starters, the company has a powerful brand that is recognized around the world. American Express has a certain cachet among consumers, which helps attract a more affluent demographic. This leads to lower default rates than competitors, meaning less capital is set aside for potential losses.', ""And this premium brand image encourages consumers to pay high fees to be Amex card holders. This lets the business offer compelling perks and rewards. Merchants are also incentivized to pay higher processing fees to accept Amex cards because of these customers' ability to spend more per transaction."", 'American Express also benefits from the network effect. As the business attracts more card members, its merchants immediately have a larger target customer base. And with more merchant acceptance locations, card holders have more places to spend. It would be almost impossible for a new payment network to start from scratch and threaten Amex, given just how difficult it would be to bring on both consumers and merchants.', ""And what's unique about Amex is that it operates a closed-loop payments system. It issues cards and funds purchases, while also maintaining direct relationships with merchants. This allows the company to collect all the fees any time its cards are swiped."", 'All of these characteristics are certainly reasons why Buffett appreciates the business so much to make the stock a top holding. American Express can even be considered a safe holding because of its durability. Even with the rise of numerous fintech enterprises during the past decade, this business continues to dominate the card and payments landscape.', 'Shares of American Express have climbed 24% in 2024 (as of March 21), beating the S&P 500 so far this year.

At about 17 times forward earnings, the current valuation is reasonable, in my opinion."", 'The company is exhibiting strong momentum. Revenue (net of interest expense) and diluted earnings per share were both up 14% in 2023. Travel and entertainment spending remains a key driver for the business. Credit charge-off rates are below pre-pandemic levels. And American Express is seeing robust membership sign-ups among millennial and Gen Z consumers, with this group accounting for 60% of new customer accounts last year.

Additionally, the system includes sites such as National Monuments, National Seashores, and National Historic Sites, among others.

The top 15 national parks collectively accounted for approximately 67% of visitor traffic in 2022, whereas the bottom 15 parks received only 1.73% of all visits. This disparity can be attributed to the geographical isolation and lack of tourist infrastructure in these lesser-known parks.', 'The purpose of safeguarding specific areas is to allow nature to flourish without human intervention. However, many individuals opt for less-populated national parks to escape the crowds and challenges associated with popular tourist destinations.

However, for those in search of a tranquil vacation, these remote parks provide an ideal retreat. The National Park Foundation (NPF) depends on corporate partnerships to support the efforts of the National Park Service (NPS) in conserving vital historical sites and natural scenery.

Of this, visits to the various national parks in Alaska contributed $1.16 billion from 2.023 million visitors in 2022. Indirectly, the NPS created 16,450 jobs and contributed $1.785 billion to the Alaskan economy.

Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) has been thriving under this model for decades.', 'The fintech company has several software products under its corporate umbrella, such as TurboTax, QuickBooks, Mailchimp, and CreditKarma. The company’s recurring business model, top-quality software products, and continued financial strength make me bullish on this stock.', 'Intuit has delivered several quarters of double-digit revenue growth. The company continued the trend in the\xa0second quarter of Fiscal 2024, as Intuit increased its revenue by 11% year-over-year in that quarter.', 'The company’s Small Business and Self-Employed Group segment delivered an 18% year-over-year increase in sales. This component of Intuit’s business generated $2.2 billion of the company’s $3.4 billion revenue total. That’s more than two-thirds of Intuit’s revenue, and it is growing at a faster pace than other segments.', 'Consumer Group revenue decreased by 5% year-over-year due to a later IRS opening to start the year, but the later opening should reflect favorably in the company’s third-quarter results. ProTax Group revenue increased by 8% year-over-year, while CreditKarma was flat with $375 million in revenue.', 'Most of the company’s segments are growing, and the fastest-growing piece of the business also happens to generate the highest percentage of Intuit’s total revenue.', 'Revenue growth doesn’t tell the entire story about any corporation. Intuit continues to maintain top-line revenue growth while expanding its profit margins significantly. Intuit reported a 108% year-over-year increase in GAAP earnings per share. The stock currently trades at a 65x P/E ratio but has a more reasonable\xa0forward P/E ratio of 39x.', 'Higher profits have helped the company raise its dividend for several years. The fintech firm recently\xa0improved its quarterly dividend\xa0from $0.78 per share to $0.90 per share. That’s a 15.4% year-over-year increase, and that type of growth is normal for Intuit’s dividend payouts.', 'Rising profit margins can strengthen the stock’s valuation and lead to more gains. Intuit has already done well for investors with a 150% gain over the past five years. The stock has also gained 55% over the past year.', 'Intuit offered guidance for the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 and the full fiscal year. The company expects 10-11% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, which ends on April 30. Full-year revenue is expected to increase by 11-12% year-over-year.', 'Earnings are also expected to achieve a double-digit growth rate. GAAP diluted EPS growth is expected to range from 11-15% in Fiscal 2024. The Small Business and Self-Employed Group will lead the way with 16-17% year-over-year revenue growth based on Intuit’s guidance.', 'The Federal Reserve anticipates\xa0lowering interest rates\xa0three times this year. A reduced interest rate will help the entire economy by reducing the cost of borrowing money. Credit card debt and personal loans will be more affordable and attainable, and consumers will have more money available to buy goods and services.', 'Lower rates can also attract more business for CreditKarma, which offers various types of loans and credit cards. However, CreditKarma only contributed $375 million to the corporation’s $3.4 billion in Q2 revenue. While it’s still a sizable percentage of the company’s total revenue, it’s not as impactful as the Small Business and Self-Employed Group.', 'The CreditKarma business segment saw flat revenue in Q2 in a high-interest rate environment, but revenue growth should accelerate once the Fed trims rates.', 'Many Wall Street analysts are feeling bullish about Intuit. The stock has a Strong Buy rating among 22 analysts, with 20 Buys and two Hold ratings. The average INTU stock price target suggests 8.3% upside potential. The highest price target of $775 indicates that the stock can rally by an additional 19%. Six analysts offered ratings for INTU stock in March, with five of them projecting that the stock will rise.', 'Intuit has multiple software products that generate recurring revenue. Many people rely on the company’s businesses to get loans, pay taxes, grow their businesses, and manage their finances.', 'The company regularly posts double-digit top-line revenue growth and net income growth at a faster rate. As profit margins expand and it grows in multiple verticals, Intuit will become a more desirable stock.', 'Solid guidance suggests financial growth will continue, and lower interest rates will serve as an additional catalyst.

There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at DaVita HealthCare (DVA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B.

Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, DVA is averaging 999,826 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising.

This move is driven by the desire among investors to seek refuge from the effects of heightened interest rates. This observation isn't merely theoretical; some instances demonstrate the superior performance of high-dividend stocks during these periods. According to a report from Global X, as referenced in our article titled 10 Highest Dividend-Paying Stocks in the S&P 500, it was revealed that high-yielding dividend stocks have exhibited superior performance compared to the broader market during periods of elevated interest rates spanning from 1960 to 2017. The report further highlighted that high-dividend stocks outperformed the S&P 500 in 7 out of 10 instances since 1960."", 'Various other reports highlighted the significance of high-dividend stocks over the course of the long term. Historical data from Eugene Fama and Kenneth French suggested that high-dividend-paying stocks have tended to offer greater protection during market downturns compared to those with lower or no dividend payouts. These higher dividend-paying stocks have demonstrated a more favorable 30-year downside capture for a period ending in 2020, experiencing notably smaller losses relative to the S&P 500 Index compared to their counterparts with lower dividend yields. Generally, dividends serve as a marker of stability for companies, with many firms reinstating dividends after significant cuts in 2020, highlighting their commitment to long-term financial health.', ""That said, some analysts don't buy into the idea that higher yields always mean better investments. They're more interested in companies that consistently grow their dividends.

To this end, he curated a list of 50 such companies for his clients. These companies boast sustainable dividend growth, with an average yield of approximately 2.6%. They also distribute less than half of their net income as dividends and are projected to achieve an earnings growth rate of about 8% annually over the next few years. He further said that investors should prioritize stocks of higher quality with lower dividend yields and stronger financial indicators instead of solely chasing after the allure of higher dividend payments.

According to the US Census Bureau, the country's population stands at 336,195,667 as of March 21. \xa0Among the regions, the South experienced the highest population growth, accounting for 38.9% of the overall increase in 2023. This was followed by growth rates of 23.6% in the West, 20.6% in the Midwest, and 17% in the Northeast during the last year. California, Texas, Florida, and New York fall among the most populated US states in 2024."", 'In 1790, the first official US census recorded a population of nearly 4 million. Since then, the population has grown rapidly, increasing by an average of 1.6% each year. One of the major factors accounting for the population growth in the US is immigration. From European immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries (who made up over 80% of the foreign-born population in 1910) to Asians and Hispanics in recent decades (who now constitute over 40% of immigrants), immigration has significantly impacted population growth. Medical advancements have also led to longer life spans, ultimately causing population growth. In 1900, the average life expectancy in the US was just under 47 years. By 2023, it has risen to nearly 76.4 years. Medical innovations and solutions by popular healthcare companies like Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also have a role to play in increasing the average life expectancy in the country.', 'Furthermore, the fertility rates have also affected population trends. Historically, the US has experienced relatively high fertility rates. In the early 1900s, the average woman had between 3 and 4 children. This contributed significantly to population growth, particularly in the post-World War II baby boom era, when fertility rates peaked at nearly four children per woman. However, these rates have declined steadily since the 1960s, reaching a record low of 1.64 births per woman in 2020.', 'While the overall population continues to grow, the US exhibits significant regional variations in density and distribution. The US population density per square mile is 93.8 people. It varies significantly throughout the country, with the District of Columbia having 11,280 people per square mile in contrast to Alaska having just 1.3 people per square mile. This variation is based on a couple of factors. Firstly, the 21st century has seen the rise of megacities leading to urbanization.\xa0 In 1950, 64% of the population of the US lived in urban cities. This population concentration in urban areas has increased significantly to 83% during present times. By 2050, this number is expected to increase to 89%. In contrast, many rural areas are experiencing population decline. From 2000 to 2010, 346 out of 1336 counties lost 5% or more of their working-age population. Between 2010 and 2020, losses increased nearly three-fold, with more than 970 rural counties losing 5% of their population. Limited economic opportunities and out-migration towards urban centers contribute to this trend.', 'The US population is projected to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace, especially after 2030. Census forecasts suggest an increase of 79 million people by 2060, with the population surpassing 400 million by 2058. It has been projected that immigration will be the largest contributing factor to the US population growth, surpassing the natural increase after 2030.

Although the sector lagged behind others like technology and communication services, there were opportunities for significant growth. As per BlackRock’s latest report, within the pharmaceutical sub-sector, performance varied widely. Notably, GLP-1 drugs emerged as effective weight loss treatments, boosting leading developers Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). However, many companies struggled due to tough year-over-year comparisons after revenue from vaccines and therapeutics surged past $100 billion in 2022 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In the medical device and supplies sector, easing supply constraints and a return to elective procedures led to 7% returns by August 1, 2023. However, an announcement by Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) regarding cardiovascular benefits in their GLP-1 SELECT trial triggered a sell-off, erasing gains and resulting in negative returns for the sub-sector. Biotechnology faced continued pressure as interest rates rose, with several indices nearing multi-year lows. Providers and services also felt the impact of COVID-19 aftershocks, with utilization trends and rising medical costs remaining concerns. However, distributors saw improvements in fundamentals and the resolution of opioid litigation issues.', 'The global healthcare sector faces another year of significant change and challenges in 2024. Providers worldwide are grappling with ongoing labor shortages and rising costs stemming from the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is optimism fueled by the broader adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence, which hold promise in addressing some of these issues. Despite this, the ongoing existence of health disparities poses additional challenges and financial burdens for the healthcare sector in 2024. If not adequately tackled, Deloitte forecasts that these inequities could lead to a threefold increase in costs, reaching $1 trillion by 2040, equating to roughly US$3,000 annually per individual.', 'On a positive note, the integration of AI and machine learning technologies offers potential solutions to these disparities, provided providers address trust and bias issues. Moreover, the pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote technologies and telemedicine, transforming the delivery and nature of healthcare. Providers are extending care beyond traditional medical services to include holistic social care, recognizing the profound impact of social determinants on overall well-being. Consequently, there is a push to integrate social care into public health systems to address multifaceted patient needs. Moreover, addressing the escalating costs of healthcare remains a priority globally, with efforts focused on controlling costs while maintaining quality and accessibility. Strategies such as value-based care models and innovative pricing structures aim to ensure cost-effective healthcare delivery.', 'According to KPMG, on the pharmaceutical side, notable policy shifts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Biden administration posed challenges alongside innovations in precision medicine. Diagnostics saw a decline in domestic mergers and acquisitions, with significant transactions involving international entities. Conversely, the medical devices sector anticipates recovery following a resurgence in elective surgeries and advancements in areas like cardiology and robotic surgery. Biopharma services continue to adapt post-COVID-19, with demand fluctuating and competition intensifying. Hospitals and health systems are focusing on efficiency and revenue enhancement through automation and strategic partnerships. Physician practices witnessed increased interest from strategic buyers, particularly in the latter half of 2023, amidst reimbursement pressures and regulatory changes.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks that Paid Special Dividends in 2024.\xa0', ""Dividends are already a delectable treat for investors, but special dividends are the cherry on the cake. Companies that offer special dividends distribute significantly higher amounts of money annually than expected. That was precisely the move Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made in 2004. With a cash reserve of over $50 billion, the company distributed a one-time special dividend that was 38 times larger than its regular dividend of $0.08 per share. These special payments frequently coincide with the holiday season and are likened to year-end bonuses, providing investors with an extra financial boost as the new year approaches. In addition to this, these supplemental dividends can have a significant impact on retirement planning, as reported by Forbes. For example, even if an investment's headline yield seems low, like 1.3%, the total return with special dividends could be much higher, around 6%. Similarly, a 4% headline yield might not seem impressive, but with special dividends factored in, the total return could be as high as 11% annually."", ""Special dividends have experienced fluctuations in popularity over time, with certain periods witnessing greater prevalence than others. Research published in the Journal of Financial Economics highlighted this trend, indicating that during the 1940s, a substantial 61.7% of dividend-paying firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) issued at least one special dividend. However, this figure dropped significantly to just 4.9% during the first half of the 1990s. Another research paper published in the Journal of Applied Finance emphasized that a company's choice to issue special dividends is connected to its investment opportunities, particularly focusing on growth prospects available within the current economic conditions. The paper examined different aspects of special dividends using research conducted by diverse financial analysts. According to the paper, special dividends serve as a method for managers to allocate excess cash flow to shareholders, addressing the issue of overinvestment.

This is largely due to the substantial contribution these stocks make to overall market returns over extended periods. Data from 1926 to July 2023 indicates that dividend income constituted 32% of the monthly total return of the S&P 500, with the remainder attributed to capital appreciation. Moreover, dividends have demonstrated resilience during periods of high inflation. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, in decades marked by significant inflation, such as the 1940s and 1970s, dividend income accounted for more than half of the total return.', 'According to a study conducted by Wisdom Tree, dividend-paying stocks have been highlighted as capable of producing significant levels of income. The report indicated that by emphasizing dividends, investors can substantially enhance their dividend earnings and potentially raise the trailing 12-month dividend yield. This strategy becomes particularly valuable in times of low yields and returns, marked by market volatility and uncertainty. Investing in dividend-weighted indexes could offer investors a means to generate essential income in such challenging environments.', 'Experienced investors, along with regular investors, stress the significance of including dividend-paying stocks in investment portfolios to ensure a steady income stream. Brian Bollinger, the president of Simply Safe Dividends, discussed the role of dividends in generating income during an interview with CNBC. He suggested that for those seeking genuinely passive income, dividend investing is a viable option. While relying on dividends for income is a common practice for retirees or those approaching retirement age, Bollinger emphasized that anyone can construct a portfolio focused on generating income from equities.

In this environment, quality homebuilding stocks such as D.R. Horton DHI may provide a safe haven. DHI’s stability and strong fundamentals position it well to withstand challenges within the industry.D.R. Horton has been reaping the benefits of the abovementioned tailwind, along with its solid acquisition strategies, increased homebuilding lots, decreasing cycle times and diverse product offerings across multiple brands and price points.Shares of this Arlington, TX-based homebuilder have rallied 45.1% over the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 41.2% rise. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%, which highlights its inherent strength. The growth prospect is further solidified with a VGM Score of B, backed by a Value Score of B.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'However, high SG&A expenses, rising land/labor and material costs and competitive pricing pressure remain concerns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed a downtrend over the past 60 days as analysts lowered their estimates, depicting concerns over the stock’s growth potential. Over the said time frame, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings per share (EPS) has decreased to $14.17 from $14.20.Let’s delve into the driving factors.', ""Improving Macro Scenario: The housing market is showing signs of strength, bolstered by a robust job market, limited availability of existing homes for sale and favorable mortgage rates. This positive trend is further supported by easing inflation and overall economic stability. The Federal Open Market Committee's recent decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate within a targeted range of 5.25%-5.5% provides a sense of stability for homebuilders.On Mar 20, 2024, the Federal Reserve chose to keep its key interest rate unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting, citing the need for additional data before considering any rate adjustments. While Fed officials grapple with the challenge of finding the right timing for potential actions, the majority still anticipate three rate cuts throughout 2024.Strategic Acquisitions: D.R. Horton's growth strategy places significant emphasis on accretive acquisitions. The company has been swiftly acquiring homebuilding entities in sought-after markets. During the fiscal first quarter of 2024, there were no reported acquisitions.In July 2023, D.R. Horton successfully acquired the homebuilding operations of Truland Homes, operating in Baldwin County, AL, and Northwest Florida, for an approximate sum of $100 million in cash. The acquired assets encompass around 155 homes in inventory, 620 lots and a sales order backlog of 55 homes. Additionally, the acquisition includes approximately 660 additional lots through land purchase contracts.In the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the company’s homebuilding investments in lots, land and development for the quarter added up to $2.4 billion, up 3% sequentially and 41.2% year over year. The investments included $1.4 billion per finished lot, $740 million for land development and $270 million for land acquisition.Affordable Homes: D.R. Horton's strategic shift toward more entry-level affordable homes has been paying off, with the segment experiencing strong demand and limited supply. First-time homebuyers represented about 56% of the company’s closings in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.Furthermore, with an improvement in labor capacity and materials availability, cycle times are decreasing, which is allowing the company to release homes for sale earlier in the construction cycle. DHI is optimistic about moving into 2024 as it is positioned well to meet the changing market conditions with its affordable product offerings and lot supply based on the level of homebuyer demand. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and the full fiscal year, our model predicts net sales orders to grow 6.7% to 24,681 units and 13.8% to 89,166 units, respectively, year over year."", 'Pressure on Margins: Escalating land and labor costs pose a threat to margins, constraining the pricing leverage of homebuilders. Labor shortages are resulting in increased wages, and limited availability is driving up land prices. Simultaneously, significant cost pressures from finished lots, skilled labor and rising material costs may impact margins across all key regions.Also, homebuilders are offering incentives to stimulate sales, thereby increasing their operating expenses. In the fiscal first quarter of 2024, homebuilding SG&A expenses increased 14.5% to $603.4 million year over year, and homebuilding SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 7.8%, up 50 bps from the prior-year period. The increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of the company’s operations to support growth, along with an increase in equity and stock market-based compensation expenses.For the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the consolidated pre-tax profit margin contracted 140 bps to 16.1% compared to the prior-year period. The decline can be attributed to a 100 bps decrease in the home sales gross margin and a 50 bps increase in homebuilding SG&A expenses (as a percentage of revenues). For the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the company expects homebuilding SG&A expenses (as a percentage of revenues) between 7.5% and 7.7%, up from 7.3% reported in the year-ago quarter.', 'NVR, Inc.

Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks that Paid Special Dividends in 2024.\xa0', ""Dividends are already a delectable treat for investors, but special dividends are the cherry on the cake. Companies that offer special dividends distribute significantly higher amounts of money annually than expected. That was precisely the move Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made in 2004. With a cash reserve of over $50 billion, the company distributed a one-time special dividend that was 38 times larger than its regular dividend of $0.08 per share. These special payments frequently coincide with the holiday season and are likened to year-end bonuses, providing investors with an extra financial boost as the new year approaches. In addition to this, these supplemental dividends can have a significant impact on retirement planning, as reported by Forbes. For example, even if an investment's headline yield seems low, like 1.3%, the total return with special dividends could be much higher, around 6%. Similarly, a 4% headline yield might not seem impressive, but with special dividends factored in, the total return could be as high as 11% annually."", ""Special dividends have experienced fluctuations in popularity over time, with certain periods witnessing greater prevalence than others. Research published in the Journal of Financial Economics highlighted this trend, indicating that during the 1940s, a substantial 61.7% of dividend-paying firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) issued at least one special dividend. However, this figure dropped significantly to just 4.9% during the first half of the 1990s. Another research paper published in the Journal of Applied Finance emphasized that a company's choice to issue special dividends is connected to its investment opportunities, particularly focusing on growth prospects available within the current economic conditions. The paper examined different aspects of special dividends using research conducted by diverse financial analysts. According to the paper, special dividends serve as a method for managers to allocate excess cash flow to shareholders, addressing the issue of overinvestment. Erik Lie, a Norwegian finance professor, discovered in The Review of Financial Studies that special dividends act as a constraint on managerial excessive spending. Additionally, May Hu, an Associate Professor at RMIT University, suggested in her research paper that companies giving special dividends during economic downturns demonstrate responsible cash management when investment options are limited."", ""As mentioned earlier, the number of special dividends distributed by US companies has varied over the years. In 2018, there were 48 instances of such dividends paid by S&P 100 companies, followed by a slight decrease to 43 in 2019, according to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, in 2021, there was a notable increase to 54, further escalating to 55 in 2022. Interestingly, in 2023 through June, the count dropped to 36, marking a significant decline compared to the preceding years. That said, on a global scale, investors received a record-breaking $1.66 trillion in dividends in 2023, as reported by Janus Henderson's Global Dividend Index.

The top 15 national parks collectively accounted for approximately 67% of visitor traffic in 2022, whereas the bottom 15 parks received only 1.73% of all visits.

(NYSE:AMP) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.', 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial ', ""Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman & CEO, James Cracchiolo, for US$8.9m worth of shares, at about US$409 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$436, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 12% of James Cracchiolo's stake."", ""Ameriprise Financial insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).', ""The last three months saw significant insider selling at Ameriprise Financial. In total, insiders sold US$29m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain."", ""Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Ameriprise Financial insiders own about US$77m worth of shares. That equates to 0.2% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders."", ""Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

But the company has expanded beyond its networking roots and now provides a variety of tech offerings, including cybersecurity."", 'Cisco bolstered its cyber threat protection capabilities with the acquisition of data analytics and cybersecurity firm Splunk on March 18. This addition makes Cisco one of the largest software companies in the world, according to CEO Chuck Robbins.', ""With this major acquisition -- Cisco's biggest to date -- and the company's stock well off its 52-week high of $58.19 reached last September, is it time to buy Cisco shares? To get an answer, it's necessary to examine the company in more detail. This will help to determine if Cisco is a good long-term investment."", 'Cisco\'s acquisition of Splunk makes sense since customers must secure their computer networks from cyber threats, particularly now that those networks extend into the cloud. Splunk\'s product suite provides the monitoring and data insights needed to shift customers ""from threat detection and response to threat prediction and prevention,"" as Robbins described it.', ""More than that, the Splunk acquisition is a strategic move toward increasing Cisco's software-as-a-service (SaaS) sales. Cisco adopted the SaaS model as a means to generate steady and predictable income."", ""To that end, the company spent years growing its software subscriptions. This subscription income rose 6% year over year in Cisco's fiscal second quarter, ended Jan. 27, to $6.4 billion. With this growth, subscription sales accounted for half of Cisco's $12.8 billion in Q2 revenue."", ""The company's subscription sales are about to get bigger thanks to Splunk. Splunk's cloud-based services employ a SaaS model, and comprised $469.4 million of its $1.1 billion in revenue in its last publicly reported fiscal quarter, which ended Oct. 31, 2023."", ""Growing predictable SaaS revenue is important to Cisco because a significant portion of the company's income is derived from selling hardware products, such as the switches and routers used in networking. This results in Cisco's revenue fluctuating up and down based on customer buying cycles."", ""In fact, the company is seeing reduced spending from its clients right now. This led to a 6% year-over-year drop in Q2 revenue. Cisco's management expects softness in customer spending to continue into the second half of its fiscal 2024. Consequently, the company reduced its full-year revenue guidance from a minimum of $57 billion to $51.5 billion."", ""The addition of Splunk should help the situation since Cisco's fiscal year guidance excludes Splunk's revenue. Moreover, Cisco management sees the rise of artificial intelligence as a driver of the company's long-term revenue growth."", 'Robbins stated, ""We are clear beneficiaries of AI adoption,"" noting Cisco\'s partnership with Nvidia to help businesses build IT infrastructure tailored to AI systems. Cisco indicated that over $1 billion in potential orders for its AI-related infrastructure products could come in fiscal 2025.', ""Deciding on whether to buy Cisco stock depends on your investing goals. Cisco isn't a high-growth tech company at this point, but it does offer income investors a dependable source of passive income. Cisco's stock provides dividend payouts with an attractive yield over 3%."", 'The networking giant has increased its dividend consistently for over a decade, even during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when other companies eliminated dividend payments. Cisco is able to maintain its dividend because it generates solid free cash flow (FCF). Its FCF was $2.9 billion in Q2. Additionally, the company committed to returning at least 50% of its FCF to shareholders annually.', ""Another consideration when evaluating an investment in Cisco stock is that, as a large, diversified business thanks to acquisitions such as Splunk, Cisco's share price is less susceptible to high volatility. So it can serve as a good stock for a retirement portfolio, such as an IRA."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Cisco Systems right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Cisco Systems, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cisco Systems wasn’t one of them.
