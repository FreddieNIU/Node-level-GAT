You won't get it right every time, but when you do, the returns can be truly splendid. One bright shining star stock has been Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), which is 300% higher than three years ago. In more good news, the share price has risen 11% in thirty days.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Nucor While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Nucor achieved compound earnings per share growth of 117% per year. The average annual share price increase of 59% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 6.14 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Nucor has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on Nucor's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Nucor's TSR for the last 3 years was 324%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Nucor shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 51% over one year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 23% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Nucor  that you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The technology-laden Nasdaq Index increased 33%, its best first half performance since 1983. While tech stocks have led the year-to-date rally, especially artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, the rally is starting to broaden to include other sectors and asset classes. With the U.S. Federal Reserve nearing the end of its interest rate hikes and the economy showing signs of resilience, many analysts and economists are predicting that the rally will continue in the year’s second half.With that in mind, investors should continue to be mindful of certain stocks.

Here are three such stocks to sell in July.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsApple (AAPL)Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.Source: Moab Republic / ShutterstockApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a strong company and stock to own. Yet, AAPL stock has achieved several significant milestones lately that may make it wise for shareholders to take profits in July. First, Apple has achieved a $3 trillion market capitalization following a blistering 55% gain in its share price over the last six months. This makes Apple the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world. Second, AAPL stock is now sitting at an all-time high.Can the run in AAPL stock continue? Possibly. But history shows that stocks often pull back and consolidate after a big rally. For this reason, shareholders might, at a minimum, want to trim their position in Apple stock and take some profits off the table. Additionally, the median price target on the stock among 39 analysts who cover the company is 2% below where the share price currently sits. This suggests that Apple has become slightly overstretched. Don’t be surprised to see the stock stall or decline in coming weeks as a result.Story continuesMetlife (MET)Source: ShutterstockFormally known as the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, Metlife (NYSE:MET) is a leading provider of life insurance policies and employee benefit programs. However, MET stock appears to be on life support lately, having declined 22% year to date and nearly 30% below its 52-week high. The stock is struggling following a shockingly bad first quarter for the company. Metlife reported Q1 net income of only $14 million, compared to $1.6 billion earned a year earlier.Metlife’s earnings per share in Q1 came in at $1.52, down 30% year over year. Among Wall Street analysts, it was 18% below the consensus forecast of $1.85 a share. The quarter was astonishingly bad. The company blamed the poor results on a 53% decline in profits for its business in Asia. They also sited a $684 million net loss on its invested premiums due to the sharp downturn in global stock markets last year. While we could see a turnaround in coming quarters, especially with stock markets rising, MET stock is one to consider selling in the near-term.U.S. Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comOptics are improving for bank stocks with news that the largest U.S. lenders successfully passed their latest stress tests.

However, some factors about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) set it apart from other bank securities which should give investors and shareholders pause. The fifth biggest bank in North America by assets, U.S. Bancorp’s stock is down 30% in the last 12 months, including a 25% decline this year. In the past five years, the share price is down 34%.USB stock badly trails the long-term performance of its peers.

Secondly, U.S. Bancorp is less diversified than other large American banks, with virtually no overseas presence. Finally, the bank is particularly sensitive to an economic slowdown.

2,f5416498-a5ad-39e4-926f-4b763bdea892,CF,2023-07-10,FOCUS-Fertilizer company OCI bets big on climate-friendly ammonia,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-fertilizer-company-oci-bets-110000071.html,1688986800,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CF']","[By Rod Nickel and Victoria KlestyJuly 10 (Reuters) - Without a single sales contract in hand, Dutch fertilizer company OCI is building a $1 billion plant in Texas to produce ammonia with low greenhouse gas emissions, a gamble requiring heavy government subsidies, new markets and a contingency plan.OCI's plant would be the world's first new commercial facility to capture and sequester 95% of the emissions produced from making ammonia. The hydrogen and nitrogen compound is mostly used as fertilizer.But the lure for OCI and others of making ammonia with a smaller carbon footprint is a business with potential beyond the farm. That includes production of fuel for coal-burning Asian utilities and for ships, both uncertain but potentially lucrative commercial possibilities.""'Are you crazy?' is the question, and I think it's a good question,"" OCI CEO Ahmed El-Hoshy told Reuters, when asked why his company is betting on producing so-called ""blue ammonia.""Producing blue ammonia costs up to $119 per metric ton more than the conventional method, but U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies worth roughly $145 per ton cover the difference, said CRU Group fertilizers analyst Alexander Derricott.To make the economics of his Beaumont, Texas plant work, El-Hoshy said he also needs Asian utilities paying premium prices to justify the capital cost.The $430 billion IRA aims to cut carbon emissions across the U.S. economy, mostly through technologies that are uneconomic without subsidies.But even with U.S. support, blue ammonia economics hinge on further government incentives. This time the incentives are expected from Japan and South Korea for utilities to produce electricity with less emissions, using coal and 20% ammonia. That is the percentage utilities consider technologically feasible for now without causing emissions of another pollutant, nitrous oxide, to increase.If utility premiums don't emerge, OCI plans to use its Texas blue ammonia to make fertilizer in The Netherlands, where the company has under-utilized its plants due to high natural gas prices. It can also sell it to industrial buyers looking to decarbonize, or sell it in the United States, El-Hoshy said.Story continuesOCI's Texas plant, to start production in 2025, will produce 1.1 million metric tons annually.Global ammonia demand looks to climb 10% by 2030 from 2021 to 203 million tons annually, according to TD Cowen and Yara data. Demand then soars to 294 million tons by 2040 and 470 million by 2050, according to the data.Others are tiptoeing into the sector. Fertilizer rivals CF Industries, Yara and Nutrien are mulling building their own U.S. Gulf Coast plants, but are at least a year from breaking ground.Japanese utility JERA has signed non-binding agreements to buy low-emissions ammonia from CF and Yara, with commercial production slated around 2027. Mitsui is a partner with CF on its Gulf project and Mitsubishi has signed a non-binding offtake agreement with Nutrien.CF has committed $285 million to capture emissions at two U.S. ammonia plants and says it has firm buyers for all the blue ammonia it would produce from the possible new plant with Mitsui.Investors and analysts are not yet convinced. Yara last month postponed an initial public offering of its clean ammonia business, citing low market valuation.""Probably the biggest unknown is if the end markets will really be there,"" said Stephan Werner, senior portfolio manager for Germany's DWS Group.If new markets do develop, however, ""for sure these companies will be worth far more than they are today,"" Werner said.Japan and South Korea are expected in the next year to create incentives for utilities to reduce emissions, unlocking premium prices for blue ammonia, El-Hoshy said.""The question will be, how sufficient will the incentives be?""TECHNICAL QUESTIONSTechnology incorporating 20% ammonia in co-generating electricity with coal is still in development. Special burners are required for power units as ammonia burns more slowly than natural gas. Such plants would still spew double the air pollution of plants that use gas and steam, according to energy analysis firm TransitionZero.Co-firing ammonia could result in extended life for coal plants, rather than phasing them out, said Katrine Petersen, senior policy advisor at environmental group E3G.""Ammonia co-firing is unlikely to ever become a widely deployed approach to power-sector decarbonisation,"" Petersen said.JERA said in a statement that it will begin demonstrating co-firing with 20% ammonia this fiscal year.""The question is, when will this hit, not will this hit,'"" said CF Chief Financial Officer Chris Bohn.SHIPPING DEMANDMember countries of the International Maritime Organization on Friday adopted a revised strategy for shipping that sets a net zero emissions target ""by or around 2050.""The first ammonia-fueled ships are due to be piloted next year, but the toxic gas, also comes with higher safety issues and higher costs, two big impediments, said Oystein Kalleklev, CEO of ship-owning companies Flex LNG and Avance Gas. Kalleklev nevertheless ordered ships this spring that can burn ammonia as he weighs future options for his fleet.Routes for ammonia-fueled ships along so-called ""green corridors"" can likely become workable with subsidies from national authorities, said Harald Fotland, CEO of Odfjell , a tanker company involved in an ammonia pilot project.However, using ammonia for ocean-going ships looks unprofitable for the foreseeable future and the fuel first needs to become readily available globally, he said.""We go to hundreds of ports,"" Fotland said. ""So to get (ship owners) to go for an ammonia solution, that I think is very far in the future on deep sea.""(Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Victoria Klesty in Oslo; additional reporting by Yuka Obayashi in Tokyo and Seher Dareen in Bengaluru; Editing by Anna Driver)]"

(NYSE:CF) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 31st of August, with investors receiving $0.40 per share. This means that the annual payment will be 2.2% of the current stock price, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings CF Industries Holdings' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, CF Industries Holdings' earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.EPS is set to fall by 54.0% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 24%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendCF Industries Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.32 total annually to $1.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 17% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. CF Industries Holdings has impressed us by growing EPS at 52% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.CF Industries Holdings Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, CF Industries Holdings has 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about.

""On the contrary, the situation is better than could have been predicted.""Risks to the banking system are low, said Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko-Invest.""Banks' open currency positions (the difference between foreign assets and liabilities) remain positive due to frozen assets, and the rouble's weakening allows banks to record additional profits,"" Polevoy said.The rouble is down more than 20% this year and still trading outside the 80-90 range that First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov said last month was preferable.Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.7% at $77.92 a barrel.Story continuesRussian stock indexes were higher.The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 1.6% to 991.3 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 0.6% higher at 2,848.2 points, its strongest point since before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.Shares in gold producer Polyus settled around 3% higher on the day after the company announced plans for a $6.3-billion share buyback that could boost its financial flexibility for future M&amp;A deals.

We will also look at some recent developments in the bigger picture of trade globally, its implications for the United States and discuss the importance of export diversification and quality. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 10 Largest Exporters in the World.The Gloomy End for Global Trade in 2022The global trade landscape witnessed contrasting developments in recent years. In the fourth quarter of 2022, global merchandise trade among the G20 countries experienced a decline in value that reflected a weak global demand accompanied by lower energy prices. Exports and imports contracted by 3.5% and 3.1%, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. The drop in oil prices particularly affected North America, with Canada, the United States,  witnessing a decrease of 6.7% and 5.4% in exports, respectively.However, the European Union saw a slight increase of 0.9% in merchandise exports, driven by strong machinery and transport equipment sales in Italy, France, and Germany. Conversely, the United Kingdom experienced a 1.6% decrease in exports, mainly due to declines in energy and chemical shipments.In terms of services trade, there was also a decline in value during the same period. Exports and imports decreased by 0.8% and 1.5%, respectively. The contraction was driven by lower shipping costs, which impacted the trade in transport services across the G20 countries. However, the travel sector showed signs of recovery from the pandemic lows. The United States saw a remarkable 4.3% increase in exports, fueled by travel, transport, and business services. Japan, Australia, and Brazil also experienced export growth, driven by a rebound in travel. On the other hand, China, Korea, and Canada faced declines in both exports and imports in the services sector.The Current Picture of Trade in the USIn March 2023, the US saw a narrowing trade deficit in goods, according to the latest report from the US Department of Commerce. The deficit decreased to $84.6 billion from the previous month's $92 billion. The month brought positive news for exports, with goods exports totaling $172.7 billion, which also demonstrated an increase of $4.9 billion compared to February 2023. On the other hand, imports of goods for March declined by $2.5 billion, reaching a total of $257.3 billion. These figures indicate a positive trend for the US economy, with an increase in goods exports and steady growth in inventories.Story continuesThe latest Refinery Capacity Report from the US Department of Energy in the US petroleum industry also reveals positive developments. After the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, US refining capacity (excluding US territories) increased for the first time in 2023. The report indicated that the total capacity reached 18.1 million barrels per calendar day (b/cd) at the beginning of 2023, showing a rise of 117,000 b/cd (0.6%) from the previous year.Although the number of operable refineries decreased slightly, overall capacity increased due to various factors. PBF Energy reactivated a previously retired crude oil distillation unit at its New Jersey refinery, contributing to the rise in capacity. Additionally, minor capacity increases reported by refineries across multiple states further supported the annual increase in 2023. These positive trends in refining capacity and utilization indicate an improved ability to meet domestic and global demand for refined petroleum products. The US is also the largest service exporter in the world as of 2022, reporting service exports amounting to $926,012 million.Export Diversification and QualityMeanwhile, encouraging the quality and diversification of exports remains crucial for promoting economic growth. When countries move from producing low-value ""poor-country goods"" to high-value ""rich-country goods,"" they undergo a structural transformation, which is essential for sustainable development. Diversifying exports allows countries to leverage global markets, reduces dependence on a narrow range of products, and mitigates export instability arising from inelastic and volatile global demand.Export diversification also helps alleviate the resource curse faced by commodity-dependent economies. By expanding the range of export products, countries can benefit from knowledge spillovers, learning-by-doing effects, and innovation that can lead to higher productivity and sustained growth.Several countries serve as examples of successful export diversification. Malaysia and Thailand have diversified their exports into manufacturing and higher-value products, while Chile has diversified its resource-based economy by developing new export activities. Uganda, despite being landlocked, has achieved export diversification in fresh and processed fish as well as higher-value agricultural products, benefiting from improved infrastructure and logistics. Encouraging quality and diversification of exports enhances competitiveness, expands markets, and drives long-term economic growth.25 Largest Exporters in the WorldSheila Fitzgerald/Shutterstock.comMethodologyUsing data obtained from the World Bank on the Total Export Value in multiples of a million USD in 2022 for each country, we have compiled a comprehensive list ranking the largest exporters in the world.

It had firmed 0.2% against the yuan to 12.63 .Seeking to project an aura of calm, Russian authorities have blamed the rouble's around 7% slump in the last few weeks on falling export revenues and recovering imports, but analysts acknowledge the impact of domestic political concerns and increased net capital outflows.Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.8% at $77.86 a barrel.Russian stock indexes were higher.The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 0.4% to 979.5 points.

The data strengthened the likelihood that the Fed would raise interest rates at its meeting later this month.Meanwhile, China's factory gate prices fell at the fastest pace in more than seven years in June, according to government data, indicating a slowdown in the recovery in the world's second-largest economy.However, oil demand from China and developing countries, combined with OPEC+ supply cuts, is likely to keep the market tight in the second half of the year despite a sluggish global economy, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.Markets are also focusing on the release of U.S. Consumer Price Index data, a key inflation report, and a slew of economic reports from China later this week to ascertain demand.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar; Additional reporting by Noah Browning, Florence Tan and Emily Chow; Editing by Alexander Smith, David Goodman, Peter Graff, Will Dunham and Paul Simao)]"

Remember, 2023’s strong first-half performance was primarily a result of gains from just half a dozen companies — mostly buzzy tech names like Meta.So what are the top stock plays for the market’s youngest generation of investors? We put that question to some Yahoo Finance Live regulars, and it turns out, some of the year's first-half winners are among the best buys.AI frenzy: Nvidia and Microsoft AI-related stocks have skyrocketed this year, and two stocks among the biggest winners of the latest investor frenzy still have room to run, pros contend.""All the rage this year and going forward is and will be AI,"" Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management told Yahoo Finance Live, naming Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) as his top picks for Gen Z investors.Nvidia’s growing dominance in the AI chip race and Microsoft’s $10 billion investment in OpenAI have helped propel these two stocks since the start of the year, with shares surging 195% and 42% respectively.That first-mover advantage is what’s going to keep these stocks among the leaders of the AI boom, according to Mahoney. Finding leaders in particular fields with stocks trading at a fair value is always key in investing, an important reminder for Gen Z investors surveying the landscape.""We see the market really ramping into Nvidia and Microsoft as they will be at the forefront of this AI revolution,"" Mahoney added. ""While Nvidia’s P/E is high, there aren’t any other cars speeding as fast down the highway.""Story continuesEV Boom: Tesla To no one's surprise, Tesla (TSLA) should be a top stock pick for Gen Z investors, according to Jay Woods, Freedom Capital Markets' chief global strategist.You've got to invest in a company that you believe in, and ""they [Gen Z] love the cars, the technology and Elon Musk,"" Woods told Yahoo Finance Live.The stock has more than doubled this year, surging about 125% since the start of January. That blistering rally has prompted a handful of analysts to move to the sidelines. But despite skepticism about its current valuation, many still see a long-term opportunity for the next generation of investors seeking to own what they know and trust (in this example, Tesla).Barclays analyst Dan Levy, who downgraded the stock last month, wrote in a client note that the team still sees ""Tesla as the long-term winner amongst carmakers in the race to an EV world,"" while Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said Tesla is still a ""must own"" in the auto space.Sounds ripe for the picking for Gen Zers.The Building Out of America: Lennar, D.R. HortonHomebuyers are turning to new home construction amid a shortage in the resale market, and that’s boosting homebuilder stocks, a trend that Portfolio Wealth Advisors CEO Lee Munson says will stay intact for some time.Munson named Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) two top picks for Gen Z investors.""You add up delayed demand from millennials, the drop in new housing from the great financial crisis, and impossible zoning restrictions in most highly populated cities, and now demand is far outstripping supply,” Munson told Yahoo Finance Live.Munson added: ""Bottom line, if you want to bet that millions of homes need to be built, D.R. Horton and Lennar are far and above the biggest volume players.""Once again, Gen Z would be wise to own the winners taking advantage of important demand trends.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at News’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for News What Is News Worth?Great news for investors – News is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $31.16, but it is currently trading at US$19.71 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because News’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of News look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for News. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since NWSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NWSA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy NWSA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

In recent months, The Los Angeles Times newspaper announced that it is eliminating 13% of its staff due to declining advertising revenue. BuzzFeed News announced it is shutting down its operations entirely. Hundreds of journalists who work for Gannett Co. (NYSE:GCI), the largest newspaper publisher in the U.S., have gone on strike to demand an end to ongoing cost-cutting measures.According to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, the U.S. media industry has announced more than 17,400 job cuts so far in 2023, the highest number of cuts on record. Many of the job losses have been at smaller community newspapers and local news stations, which are struggling financially.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsYet it’s not all doom and gloom. Amid the carnage, a select few media companies are thriving thanks to a combination of strong content and savvy business moves. These publicly traded companies are worth consideration, given the outperformance of their share prices. Here are the three best media stocks to buy for July 2023.Thomson Reuters (TRI)newspapers folded and arranged in row like books on a shelf. gray background.Source: ShutterstockThomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) is a highly successful global news organization despite a declining industry. Toronto-headquartered Thomson Reuters owes its success to the 2008 acquisition of the British company Reuters Group. This move gave it the Reuters News Agency, a newswire that spans the globe. It has 2,500 journalists and 600 photographers stationed at 200 bureaus around the world. Literally billions of people view Reuters news coverage each day. It clients include eight of the top 10 global newspapers and every U.S. TV network.Media outlets are shrinking in size by closing news bureaus and laying off staff. Consequently, they are increasingly relying upon Reuters news stories to provide content. This has led to strong earnings and share price appreciation for TRI. For this year’s first quarter, the company reported that its revenue grew 4% year over year to $1.7 billion. Its operating profit increased 23% to $508 million, while its free cash flow rose 58% to $133 million. Thomson Reuters also maintained its 2023 outlook despite a slowing economy.Story continuesTRI stock is up 25% over the last 12 months and has gained 188% in the past five years.New York Times Co. (NYT)The headquarters of the New York Times (NYT) at night.Source: Osugi / Shutterstock.comNicknamed the “Gray Lady” for its serious tone, The New York Times (NYSE:NYT) is one of the few media companies to have successfully transitioned its news coverage online. Currently, 9.7 million worldwide subscribers read the Times,  710,000 of whom subscribe to print, while the other nine million read digital. The New York Times is clearly profitable from its subscriptions alone. This fact makes the company less reliant on advertising revenue, which can be cyclical and prone to ups-and-downs.In Q1 of this year, NYT reported its ad revenue fell 8.6% to $106 million, dragged lower by declines in advertising among technology and finance companies. However, the Times added 190,000 net new digital subscribers in the quarter, helping to offset the drop in ad spending. Increasingly, The New York Times is becoming a multi-media company, adding podcasts, video documentaries, and even animation to its news coverage.In 2022, the company bought the popular online sports news site The Athletic for $550 million. They are beginning to offer it to readers in bundled subscriptions. The Times recently reported that The Athletic had 3.3 million subscribers in Q1, more than double the number it had a year earlier. NYT stock has risen 42% in the last 12 months, including a 20% gain so far this year. Over five years, the stock is up 51%.News Corp. (NWSA)News Corp. (NWSA_ Building frontSource: ShutterstockNews Corp. (NASDAQ:NWSA) is a diverse media company. It boasts the Fox News television network, Dow Jones Newswire, The Wall Street Journal, and HarperCollins book publisher. The company also owns The New York Post and Fox Sports TV network, as well as dozens of influential United Kingdom and Australian newspapers. As with the other media outlets on this list, News Corp. has managed to build a successful media company that spans the globe.The business-focused Wall Street Journal also has built a successful paid-subscription model, and Fox News maintains a devoted viewership. The company’s recent earnings have been challenged by lower advertising revenue, which has weighed on the stock, amid fears of a global economic downturn. However, despite the near-term issues, NWSA stock has managed to perform well. It rose 25% in the last 12 months, including a 7% year to date gain.

The union and company blame each other for bargaining delays and alleged labor law violations.Starbucks has been accused of more than 570 unfair labor practice charges. On Thursday, the National Labor Relations Board sued Starbucks over its refusal to rehire 33 workers as it shuffled three downtown Seattle stores into its ""Heritage District"" after one of those cafes unionized.The dispute is threatening Starbucks' reputation as a progressive employer, with some investors pressuring the company to account for its treatment of pro-union employees.The union now represents baristas and shift supervisors at about 320 of Starbucks' roughly 9,000 corporate-owned U.S. locations. However, its recent growth is at risk if it cannot reach deals at the stores where it represents employees.""Despite the fact that we have attempted to schedule bargaining for hundreds of stores, Workers United has only met Starbucks at the table to progress negotiations for 11 stores,"" Starbucks said in a statement.""(Employees) voted for bargaining not buses,"" the company said, adding that stalled negotiations have led workers to be so frustrated that they filed petitions to kick out the union at several stores.The union's tour has two legs: one travels through the Midwest, South and East, while a second leg will run up the Pacific coast, arriving in Seattle around Aug. 7, the union said.The tour will also target Starbucks board members such as Land O'Lakes CEO Beth Ford, whose likeness was carved into a statue made of butter that union members delivered to the creamery's Minneapolis headquarters in April.(Reporting by Hilary Russ; Editing by Richard Chang)]"
24,3eefe3ab-c1f8-32fc-b34a-b4d4f8b6767c,SYY,2023-07-10,What Does Sysco Corporation's (NYSE:SYY) Share Price Indicate?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-sysco-corporations-nyse-syy-140029074.html,1688911229,STORY,['SYY'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$78.32 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$69.52. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Sysco's current trading price of US$74.33 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Sysco’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Sysco Is Sysco Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 24.35x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 20.26x, which means if you buy Sysco today, you’d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. And if you believe that Sysco should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Sysco’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Sysco?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 72% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Sysco. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SYY’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SYY? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SYY, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for SYY, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

25,5f30fa00-f115-3855-9ec8-9dda21aef7e9,ADM,2023-07-10,7 Stocks to Buy Now if You Still Think a Recession Is Ahead,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-still-002204359.html,1688430124,STORY,"['SRE', 'KR', 'FIVE', 'ADM', 'WTRG', 'WM', 'CL']","[Preparing for a recession at this juncture seems a ridiculous concept at this juncture. As CNBC pointed out late last week, the Federal Reserve’s key inflation measure showed that prices increased by just 0.3% in May, favorably below expectations. Put another way, disinflation is occurring which means that recession-proof stocks are only for worrywarts, right?Well, maybe not. While the inflation data is encouraging, it’s also worth pointing out that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Biden’s plan to forgive student debt. That will likely weigh on discretionary retail sectors as affected individuals face a harsh reality check. Thus, it’s still a good idea to at least consider safe stocks in a recession.Also, credit card debt hit a record high, implying that the Covid-19 pandemic failed to teach financial prudence. Should circumstances go awry, many if not most households lack the wherewithal to navigate effectively. Therefore, the below recession stocks to buy remain relevant despite the latest headline numbers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRecession-Proof Stocks: Waste Management (WM)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the case for Waste Management (NYSE:WM) as one of the recession-proof stocks to buy practically sells itself. As the leading provider of waste and environmental services in North America, the company commands a serious moat. You can’t just ask for land for the purpose of making a landfill. Therefore, Waste Management enjoys an entrenched natural monopoly.On the financial side, about the only major source of hesitation toward WM as a vehicle for investing during a recession is the valuation prospect. Trading at a forward multiple of 28.64, acquiring WM commands a hefty premium since the underlying sector’s median forward price-earnings ratio is only 19.23 times.Nevertheless, what I appreciate about WM is its strong three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 9.5%. This stat beats out 60.71% of its peers. Unsurprisingly, the company benefits from consistent profitability. As a result, it’s one of the safe stocks in recession because everybody generates trash, downturn or not.Story continuesRecession-Proof Stocks: Colgate-Palmolive (CL)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAnother almost self-explanatory case for recession-proof stocks to buy, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is a major player in the personal care segment. Fundamentally, what I appreciate about Colgate is its namesake products for toothcare. Irrespective of whether a recession materializes or not, people will brush their teeth. It’s also one of the easiest processes involved regarding preventative care.Regarding the financial aspect, Colgate again suffers a similar dilemma to Waste Management. Basically, as one of the more obvious ideas for recession stocks to buy, several folks have already piled into CL. Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 24.62. In contrast, the underlying sector median stat is 16.63 times. Thus, we’re talking about a sizeable premium.On the other hand, Colgate also benefits from consistent profitability, making it an appropriate idea if you’re preparing for a recession. Put another way, business predictability should command its own premium during a down cycle.Recession-Proof Stocks: Kroger (KR)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker StocksSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAgain, Kroger (NYSE:KR) presents an intuitive canvas for recession-proof stocks to buy. As a major player in the supermarket segment, Kroger stands to benefit from the trade-down effect. This concept involves consumers trading down their common purchases for cheaper alternatives (rather than going cold turkey). By logical deduction, Kroger represents a trade-down for consumers who previously went out to restaurants or ordered food deliveries.Financially, Kroger presents a very intriguing argument for investing during a recession. Sure, the company only features a trailing-year net margin of 1.71%, which is slightly worse than the sector median of 1.82%. At the same time, Kroger carries a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.3%, outpacing nearly 70% of sector rivals.Most enticingly, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of 10.44. As a discount to projected earnings, Kroger ranks better than 83.08% of enterprises in the defensive retail space. Also, it trades at 0.23 times trailing sales, favorably below 69.9% of its peers. Thus, it’s one of the safe stocks in recession.Five Below (FIVE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comWhile I’m a big fan of discount dollar stores as a frontline strategy for recession-proof stocks, they can also be problematic. Let’s face reality: dollar stores tend to be grimy affairs that might not attract customers during non-recession years. Fortunately, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) fills a nice niche in the discount retail space.Offering products priced mostly at five bucks but also select products that run to $25, Five Below delivers a bargain and a touch of class. Therefore, it should be relevant irrespective of whatever’s happening with the economy.On a financial basis, Five Below benefits from a strong three-year revenue growth rate of 18.8%, above 80.44% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate clocks in at 18.6% during the same period. Additionally, concerned investors will likely appreciate Five Below’s consistent profitability. To be fair, FIVE carries a rich premium to both earnings and sales. Still, if circumstances go awry, Five Below will likely swing much higher from here.Sempra Energy (SRE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Speaking of natural monopolies, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) commands one of the most lucrative. First, Sempra of course represents a major player in the public utility space. No matter what happens with the market or the economy, you must still pay your bills. And not that I know from personal experience but these folks hunt you down if you forget to pay.Second, Sempra serves large portions of the Southern California market, which isn’t surprising given its San Diego headquarters. As you know, California – despite its criticisms – is the economic engine of this nation. By logical deduction, Sempra serves the residents of this economic engine. Stated differently, it’s going to get its bills paid, downturn or no downturn.Therefore, SRE easily ranks among the recession-proof stocks to buy. In all fairness, Sempra’s financials leave much to be desired on paper. However, the biggest takeaway is that it’s consistently profitable, which isn’t a shocker. Thus, put shares on your radar if you’re investing during a recession.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) offers a complete portfolio of ingredients and solutions to meet any taste and a commitment to sustainability, according to its corporate profile. As with the other recession-proof stocks to buy, the case for ADM truly sells itself. If you want to know, it’s that humans obviously have to eat.What’s really interesting about ADM centers on its value proposition. A cursory glance at its business model will reveal that ADM presents an obvious case for safe stocks in recession. You’d think people would be all over Archer Daniels. Instead, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of only 11.34. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 76.52% of its peers.In addition, Archer features a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.4%, beating out 76.67% of entities in the consumer packaged goods space. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same frame clocks in at an impressive 30.8%. Thus, it’s one of the recession stocks to buy.Essential Utilities (WTRG)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comBased in Pennsylvania, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) is one of the largest publicly traded water, wastewater, and natural gas providers in the U.S. Per its public profile, it serves approximately 5 million people across 10 states under the Aqua and Peoples brands. Essential is committed to excellence in proactive infrastructure investment, regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and environmental stewardship.Despite what should be a clear case for recession-proof stocks to buy, Essential suffered badly so far this year. Since the January opener, WTRG slipped more than 17%. Even with that magnitude of red ink, shares appear overvalued against both trailing and forward earnings.Still, Essential carries one of the most important attributes when it comes to investing during a recession: consistent profitability. Also, it packs a stout top line with a three-year revenue growth rate of 28.3%, beating out 91.87% of its peers. On a final note, analysts peg WTRG as a moderate buy with a price target of $50.50. That implies almost 27% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

26,8adce828-8d08-38b0-a29b-13c5791fd635,ADM,2023-07-10,The 3 Most Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Now: July 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-dividend-aristocrats-130049758.html,1688389249,STORY,"['BEN', 'CAH', 'HIG', 'ADM']","[Few stock strategies have a better track record of success than dividend investing. That’s because companies that pay dividends are typically businesses that are themselves successful and profitable. The evidence shows that dividend stocks can withstand the vagaries of stock market cycles and outperform those companies that don’t pay a dividend.Hartford Financial Services (NYSE:HIG) analysts found that since 1930 there has not been a single decade where dividend stocks lost money. Even when the broader market was losing money for investors, income stocks produced positive returns.Dividend Aristocrats are S&amp;P 500 stocks that have raised their dividend every year for at least 25 years. They tend to offer higher yields than the average index stock (2.5% vs. 1.8%) and at lower risk. Moreover, they outperform the index 70% of the time in months when the S&amp;P 500 declines.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe following three Dividend Aristocrats are undervalued and worth adding to your portfolio in July.Cardinal Health (CAH)Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of itSource: ShutterstockDrug and laboratory products supplier Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) is a modern-day seller of shovels and pickaxes to gold miners. Just as occurred in the Gold Rush, those who provided the tools to the miners came out on top regardless of whether gold was found or not.Cardinal Health is the same. Because it’s not reliant upon any one product and doesn’t need to discover the next blockbuster drug, it thrives across time. It sells to all the companies that are mining for the next big thing.Cardinal serves nearly 90% of U.S. hospitals, over 60,000 U.S. pharmacies, and more than 10,000 specialty physician offices and clinics. Some 3.4 million patients use over 46,000 home healthcare products sold by Cardinal. Sales have grown at less than 7% annually over the past five years, but are forecast to grow more than 15% a year for the next five years.The drug and lab products company paid its first dividend in 1983. It has increased the payout for 37 years. The dividend currently yields 2.1% annually. That’s a nice bonus for investors who can get into the dividend growth stock today at just 14 times next year’s earnings estimates, a fraction of its sales, and less than six times the free cash flow it produces.Story continuesFranklin Resources (BEN)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Franklin Resources (BEN).Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAs the operator of the Franklin Templeton family of funds, Franklin Resources (NYSE: BEN), had about $1.4 trillion assets under management (AUM) at the end of its fiscal second quarter. That reflects $8 billion in total net outflows in the period though AUM is still up year to date as the market bounced back. Franklin Resources is trying to change its reliance upon investment management fees, which make up the bulk of its revenues. That makes it highly susceptible to market fluctuations, but it is steadily diversifying its asset base to accelerate growth. For example, it recently agreed to acquire Putnam Investments for $925 million, the retirement asset business of Power Corporation of Canada (OTCMKTS:PWCDF). It will boost Franklin’s defined contribution AUM to about $90 billion.Previously Franklin acquired one of Europe’s biggest credit and private debt managers, Alcentra. It also acquired Lexington Partners, a global alternative investment manager to bolster its existing capabilities in real estate, private credit and hedge fund strategies.Franklin Resources raised its dividend to $0.30 per share last year. It gives the asset manager an unbroken 42-year history of increasing its payout. The dividend yields a juicy 4.5% annually.With an adjusted earnings payout ratio of around 50%, Franklin Resources dividend is relatively safe. At just 10 times next year’s earnings estimates and an enterprise value-to-EBITDA of 11, this asset manager is also an undervalued dividend stock.Archer-Daniels Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comArcher-Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is an agricultural products processor that benefited from skyrocketing commodity costs. In 2022, it turned in record earnings of $7.85 per share. As pricing has settled, however, ADM’s stock has sunk. Shares are down a striking 20% year to date. Yet the stock also goes for nine times trailing earnings, a level not seen for over a decade. At 10 times next year’s estimates and just a fraction of its sales, this stock is undervalued. The market seems to have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. While pricing might be momentarily weak, people need to eat, so there will be no shortage of demand for food. There is also a heightened need for animal feed and biofuels, particularly as demand for renewable biodiesel increases. The ongoing war in Ukraine is also keeping wheat prices high.Archer-Daniels Midland is not only a Dividend Aristocrat, but a Dividend King, with a 50-year record of raising its payout. The dividend yields a healthy 2.4% annually. With a payout ratio of just 22.5%, the ag products processor’s dividend is safe and has plenty of room for future growth, too. Mark this undervalued dividend growth stock as one you’ll want to plant in your own portfolio.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in CAH and BEN stock.

PPG is bullish about the growth in paints and coatings in 2023 as the auto industry and aerospace outperformed in Q1. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to grow earnings by 20.2% this year.PPG was founded in Pennsylvania in 1883. The company is celebrating its 140th year in business this year. It develops and delivers paints, coatings and specialty materials to customers in more than 70 countries. It has customers in the construction, consumer products, industrial and transportation markets and aftermarkets.PPG Outlines Growth FrameworkOn May 24, 2023, PPG shared its PPG framework for purposeful, profitable growth for the next 4 years.It aims to establish annual 2% to 4% organic sales growth. It expects annual adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 12% through 2026.Additionally, it aims for free cash flow of about $1 billion per year.Record Q1 SalesOn Apr 20, 2023, PPG reported its first quarter results and blew by the Zacks Consensus, reporting earnings of $1.82 versus the consensus of $1.55. That's a beat of $0.27, or 17.4%.It was the second beat in a row for PPG.The company saw record first quarter sales of $4.38 billion, up 2% from $4.308 billion in the prior year due to an 8% rise in selling prices while volumes declined 3%.Several businesses outperformed the company's original forecast including the aerospace coatings business and the Latin America region, with both delivering record sales. PPG's automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) coatings business also was boosted by solid global production growth.Analysts Getting Bullish AgainPPG will report second quarter results on July 20, 2023. In April, the company believed the macro environment would generally remain consistent with the first quarter with continued stabilization of economic activity at lower levels in Europe and modestly improving demand in China.In the US, PPG expected sequential slowing in economic activity in certain end-use markets, particularly in those that were construction-related.It gave full year earnings guidance in the range of $6.95 to $7.25.But analysts don't seem to think the April forecast is going to be correct. 1 analyst has raised both the 2023 and 2024 earnings estimate in the last week and that has pushed the consensus above the company's guidance range.The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to $7.27 from $6.84 just 3 months ago. That's earnings growth of 20.2% over 2022 where the company made $6.05.Shares Attractively ValuedShares of PPG are up 16.7% year-to-date which is outperforming the S&amp;P 500 which is up 14.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBut it is still attractively valued with a forward P/E of 20 and a PEG ratio of just 1.1.

29,f537b6d5-6e38-3c2b-8e8e-2bf0cfa3f122,SLB,2023-07-10,"Don’t be duped by doomsayers, billionaire Ken Fisher says — this mega-cap-led surge has legs. Here are 3 stocks he’s using to bet on a bounce",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-duped-doomsayers-billionaire-221814191.html,1688941094,STORY,"['DHR', 'SLB', 'COP']","[Ken FisherIt hasn’t gone unnoticed that the market’s strong performance this year has been led by the mega-caps, with the tech giants largely responsible for the surge in the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. This has led many commentators to issue warnings about the lack of market breadth driving the gains, with many believing it indicates that the market is a lot more fragile than it looks.However, that is not the case at all, according to billionaire Ken Fisher, who thinks that “bad breadth” is a bullish indicator.“This widespread doom and gloom – whether it’s the Fed, the Ukraine invasion, or the latest banking crisis – is actually bullish for stocks,” says the Fisher Investments founder whose net worth is valued at ~$6.7 billion. “This is what we call fear of a false factor. False fear is always hurting prices in a given moment, setting the stage for spring-loaded gains. Bad breadth is the latest such false fear – and it screams that this mega-cap-led surge has legs — maybe not this week or this month, but fully through 2023.”So, the rally, according to Fisher, is set to push ahead. With this in mind, we thought we’d get the lowdown on three stocks residing in his portfolio that he clearly expects to capitalize on the upward trend.According to the TipRanks database, Wall Street analysts are on board too, giving all of these picks a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating. Let’s see why Fisher and the Street’s experts think these are good investment choices right now.Danaher Corporation (DHR)The first stock Fisher is betting on is Danaher, a multinational corporation working in the global life sciences and diagnostics industry. The company’s extensive offerings range from scientific instruments and water treatment systems to dental tools, and industrial technologies. Danaher operates as a conglomerate, with over 20 distinct companies operating under its wing. This is a huge business boasting a market-cap of almost $172 billion with the company’s R&amp;D, manufacturing, sales, distribution and administrative premises located in over 60 countries.Story continuesFor a feel for this global firm’s size, we can look at the latest quarterly numbers. In 1Q23, Danaher raked in revenues of $7.2 billion. However, that represented a 6.4% year-over-year decline on account of lower Covid-19-related sales. Likewise at the other end of the scale, adj. EPS dropped from $2.76 a year ago to $2.36. Furthermore, the operating cash flow reached $1.9 billion, while the non-GAAP free cash flow amounted to $1.7 billion by the end of the quarter.While the top-and bottom-line figures still trumped Street expectations, investors appeared less convinced with the results or the firm’s outlook of high-single-digit % growth of base business core revenue, subsequently sending shares lower. All told, the shares have yet to enjoy any of 2023’s market spoils, down by 12% year-to-date.Nevertheless, Ken Fisher’s confidence in Danaher’s trajectory remains steadfast, as evidenced by his fund’s significant ownership of 4,035,913 shares, which are currently valued at over $940 million.The company also gets the support of SVB Securities analyst Puneet Souda who points out to investors the opportunity at play here.“We see DHR as the most meaningful mega-cap long for 2023-24 among the life science tools universe with its guide now fully reset on the most attractive, spec’d-in and recurring revs market of bioprocess tools,” Souda explained. “Despite the near-term growth contraction that is already baked in, we believe DHR’s scale, diversification, its DBS (Danaher business system) process, leading profitability profile (60%+ GM; 30%+ OM) and $25B dry powder for M&amp;A, combined with the best-in-class or near-best-in-class businesses (Aldevron, Cepheid, Cytiva…), set the stage for outperformance for years to come.”These comments underpin Souda’s Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating, while his $300 price target makes room for 12-month returns of ~29%. (To watch Souda’s track record, click here)Most agree with that thesis. DHR claims a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating, based on 14 Buys vs. 3 Holds. At $277.76, the average target implies shares will appreciate by 19% in the year ahead. (See DHR stock forecast)Schlumberger Limited (SLB)Let’s now switch gears and take a turn into the energy sector for our next Fisher-backed stock. Schlumberger, the largest offshore drilling company in the world, is a dominant player in the oilfield services industry. With a presence in over 120 countries, the company delivers a wide range of oilfield equipment and services to the international oil and gas industry. Its extensive service portfolio encompasses crucial operations such as oil well testing, site evaluation, data analysis, drilling, and lifting activities.Boasting a market cap of $76 billion, this is a big operation, one that generated over $28 billion in revenues last year. Going by the sales delivered in Q1, the Houston, Texas-based company appears on track to exceed that this year.In the quarter, the company generated revenue of $7.7 billion, amounting to a 30% increase on the same period last year and beating the consensus estimate by $240 million. Adj. EPS of $0.63 also outpaced analyst expectations by $0.02.While those were good results, the company delivered softer-than-anticipated cash flow and indicated that North American onshore market activity – specifically U.S. shale gas, which boosted growth last year – could plateau during 2023.Meanwhile, Fisher remains heavily invested in Schlumberger, as his fund currently owns 19,604,360 SLB shares, valued at over $1.04 billion.Mirroring that confident stance, RBC analyst Keith Mackay likes the look of what’s on offer, so much so that SLB is on RBC’s Global Energy Best Ideas List.“We believe SLB is well-positioned to benefit from a continuing up-cycle in the international and offshore space which should drive further revenue growth and margin expansion,” the 5-star analyst said. “Longer-term, the company has also identified five key areas for Energy Transition-related growth.”Quantifying this stance, Mackay rates SLB shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy), along with a $67 price target. If the figure is met, investors could potentially earn returns of 25.5% a year from now. (To watch Mackay’s track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, other analysts have also been impressed. Based on 9 Buys and no Holds or Sells, the word on the Street is that SLB is a Strong Buy. At $66, the average target suggests shares will climb ~24% higher over the one-year timeframe. As an added bonus, Schlumberger also pays a quarterly dividend. The current payout stands at $0.25 per share and yields 1.87%. (See SLB stock forecast)ConocoPhillips (COP)We’ll stay in the energy sector for our last Fisher-endorsed name and check out another industry giant. When it comes to production and proved reserves, ConocoPhillips stands as one of the world’s largest independent E&amp;P (exploration and production) firms. In other words, it is a company actively involved in searching for and extracting oil and gas resources. With a history dating back to the late 19th century, ConocoPhillips operates in various regions worldwide, including the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The company maintains a diverse portfolio of assets that encompasses both conventional and unconventional resources.With a market cap of $125 billion, the company sits at number 49 on the Fortune 500 list, climbing 28 spots higher this year after revenue increased by almost 70%, and its profits rose 131% in 2022, boosted by an uptick in crude oil prices on account of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.In the most recently reported quarter, profits didn’t quite reach the levels attained in the same period last year but still exceeded Street expectations. Q1 earnings reached $2.9 billion, or $2.38 per share vs. $5.8 billion ($4.39 per share) in 1Q22, although the analysts were only looking for EPS of $2.07. Additionally, Q1 production climbed by 45,000 boe/day to a quarterly record of 1.792 million boe/day, while the firm also increased its full-year production outlook at the midpoint by 10 MBOED.ConocoPhillips offers both a fixed dividend and a variable dividend that changes depending on the company’s performance. The latest payout included a regular dividend of $0.51 per share (offering a 1.98% yield) and a variable dividend of $0.60 per share (2.32% yield).Ken Fisher is evidently keen on this oil and gas exploration company. He holds a big COP position, owning 7,022,759 shares. These are currently worth almost $725 million.It’s no wonder that Truist analyst Neal Dingmann comprehends Fisher’s investment rationale, as the appeal of Conoco is easy to explain. The 5-star analyst writes, “The fruits of prior labor is paying dividends (literally) as Conoco’s legacy acreage along with the highly successful 2021 Concho and Shell Permian additions are resulting in the highest production in company history. COP also continues to position itself smartly with strategic non-Lower 48 assets such as Willow, Port Author LNG, APLNG, and various conventional assets among others. We forecast the company to easily generate the highest FCF yield among the majors using the proceeds to reward investors, eliminate debt, and potentially take down further strategic external assets.”Accordingly, Dingman rates COP shares a Buy, while his $165 price target represents potential upside of 60% from current levels. (To watch Dingman’s track record, click here)On the Street, barring one fencesitter, all 13 other analyst reviews are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of ~30%, considering the average target stands at $133.92.

33,5ddfb61c-941f-3409-aca5-01d5fc55e62d,WYNN,2023-07-10,7 Dead-End Stocks to Sell Before They Dive,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dead-end-stocks-sell-014928692.html,1688435368,STORY,"['WYNN', 'OPEN', 'BYND', 'GME', 'PETS', 'MULN']","[For investors, knowing when to cut ties with dead-end stock picks is always a challenge. It’s easy to remain idle in the hope that a given weak investment will suddenly turn positive. As Warren Buffett said, “Inactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior.” He meant that holding onto investments in fundamentally strong, profitable firms should be the crux of every investing strategy and struck his team as a smart decision. Taken differently, we could understand his quote to imply that although inactivity strikes us as ‘intelligent’, it actually isn’t. I think that applies here. Passively hoping that the shares below will rebound is a poor strategy. These aren’t Buffett-style investments. Instead, they’re fundamentally weak firms lacking strong fundamentals and are due for further nose dives. Getting out of the top dead-end stock picks now is the best choice. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDead-End Stock Picks: AMC (AMC)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonMeme stocks like AMC (NYSE:AMC) catch a lot of flak for their association with what many see as a flawed investment style. In some cases that criticism is unfair. Meme stocks have come a long way since the beginning of the pandemic when the so-called ‘lockdown luminaries’ emerged. There’s much more nuance and traditional, empirical evidence-based investing advice today than a few years ago. Unfortunately for AMC, it remains a poor choice based on flawed thinking. In other words, AMC deserves the criticism it receives. The movie theater business isn’t what it once was. Viewers now have many more options than they did in the recent past. That rapid shift has resulted in declining business prospects for AMC. Unfortunately, AMC offers investors false hope in that regard. Revenues increased by 21.5% in the first quarter. That might lead some investors to mistakenly believe a turnaround is in effect. It isn’t – the upsurge is instead lingering Covid effects – and AMC continues to contract. Story continuesJust compare those ‘improved’ Q1 revenues of $954 million to those from 2020 and 2019 and the real narrative emerges. Q1 sales hit $941 million in 2020 and $1.2 billion in 2019. That should tell investors that AMC is going in the wrong direction. Dead-End Stock Picks: Wynn Resorts (WYNN)Grayish photo of investor's hands hovering over laptop with red stock graph showing downward arrow overlayed on top of the imageSource: shutterstock.com/Leonid SorokinWynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) stock is not necessarily destined for a nose dive, nor is it a particularly weak stock. But I do think it is overvalued even though it remains well below its target price. The reason is fairly simple. Wynn Resorts is benefiting from the overall surge in tourism while remaining as fundamentally weak as it was a year earlier. While Wynn Resorts’ revenues increased by nearly 50% in the first quarter, reaching $1.423 billion, its losses did not narrow. The company remained roughly $1 million away from breakeven despite booming casino, room, food &amp; beverage, and entertainment revenues. Investors are likely waiting to see whether Wynn Resorts can actually make something positive of the bonanza in travel that’s been handed to the firm. Here’s why I’d bet against that: WYNN stock has proven that it doesn’t create value. The firm’s cost of capital exceeds the returns it receives from investing that capital. That’s the definition of value destruction which is part of the reason the company doesn’t see its losses narrow even though times are good in its industry. Dead-End Stock Picks: GameStop (GME)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockGameStop (NYSE:GME) is the other predominant meme stock investors know about. Like AMC, I’d argue that it’s more danger than it’s worth. GME stock is simply not worth what it trades for. The few lingering Wall Street analysts that maintain coverage of the pandemic-era dark horse assign it a target price of $13. It trades for $24 so the risk is as clear as can be. Even the $13 assigned to its shares looks extraordinarily generous based on the idea that GME was worth less than $1 in mid-2020. Ryan Cohen has championed the firm into something that’s unique and difficult to define. The result is a sort of aura around the firm that has made it difficult to define through traditional pricing metrics. Rest assured, those traditional means will find a way to correct for current pricing. Sales weakened during the first quarter and losses were substantial, though narrower. Just ask yourself the most important question when it comes to GameStop: Are consumers, or are consumers not increasingly utilizing digital services for gaming that invalidate most of GameStop’s business model?Opendoor (OPEN)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockOpendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) stock is one of the more salient examples of technology meeting opportunity, leading to trouble. The company is a so-called iBuyer, a company that relies on pricing algorithms to dictate prime inventory to purchase. It used that technological advance, and I use the term ‘advance’ lightly here, to entice investors that put vast sums of capital behind the firm. That turned it into a hot entrant during the pandemic and share prices spiked. Opendoor’s task was then to go out and use its algorithm to identify ideal markets and put that capital to work buying up investment houses. It hasn’t worked well. Opendoor lost $101 million during the first quarter. Sales declined by 39% with home sales by volume down 35%. It has 6,261 homes on its balance sheet and is attempting to effectively de-risk its model and walk down inventory while avoiding catastrophe. OPEN shares are a fair indictment of many of the issues afflicting the housing market currently. Beware, AI firms will be popping up that promise to have ‘fixed’ the iBuying algorithm problems that plagued Opendoor. They’ll be hyped in similar ways but let OPEN leave you once bitten twice shy and stay away. Mullen Automotive (MULN)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockMullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN) recently announced a moratorium on investor financing throughout the remainder of 2023. The announcement will mean little for its extremely weak stock which trades for roughly a dime. The company is telegraphing the idea to the public that it has sufficient cash and capital. Whether that’s true or not, share prices have fallen from $3.25 to $0.11 in 2023. That’s what matters. Mullen Automotive is a pre-revenue firm with operational losses that more than tripled YoY during the six months that ended March 31(1). Net losses increased, though relatively less, but still are approaching $500 million. It’s a prime example of SPAC largesse and overexcitement in the markets for the newest, hottest growth markets. When things go wrong in these markets, they really go wrong. The single saving grace for Mullen Automotive is that it actually will record revenue in Q2 following the sale of 22 EV cargo vans for $308,000. That equates to a $14,000 per vehicle price on average. Does that seem likely to result in a sustainable business in the long run or more like a company looking to get any revenue on its books? PetMed Express (PETS)earningsSource: ShutterstockA lot of investors expect PetMed Express (NASDAQ:PETS) stock to decline sometime in the near future. Few metrics explain that idea better than short interest, which hovers near 27%. 27% short interest means that 27% of all shares floated have been borrowed under the assumption that they will decline in value, triggering a sale and profit for those sellers. In short, extreme bearishness.Why not? Sales continue to decline, falling in both the last 12 months and the quarter. The $6 million in net income the company received in Q1 ‘22 became a $5.1 million net loss a year later. PetMed Express increased its customer base by 12% in the first quarter. However, sales decreased by 5.4% during the same period. I don’t have to explain why that’s a net negative. But here’s a thought: The company has 12% more responsibility while simultaneously getting 5% less from that responsibility. If that weren’t enough, PetMed Express also has one of the most inflated P/E ratios of any firm, in the worst 0.5% to be precise. It’s extremely overvalued. Beyond Meat (BYND)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) was a trendy stock in a trendy growth niche that looks to be fizzling. Hype may simply never materialize into anything tangible in the case of plant-based meats. It presents a conundrum to investors in the case of BYND stock. Even now, the plant-based meat sector appears to offer a lot f hope. The compound annual growth rate expected between 2023 and 2027 is 14.7%. That’s a rate that can turn a little bit if capital, placed in the right shares, into a lot of capital pretty quickly. But at the same time, Beyond Meat is clearly not growing at that rate. Revenues fell by 15.7% during the firts quarter. That leaves investors with a few possible explanations. Either forecasters are plainly wrong or Beyond Meat simply isn’t the right company to meat the growth opportunity. I don’t know what the answer is there. I only know that Beyond Meat lost $59 million during the most recent quarter and that its burgers don’t appeal to me personally. Vegetables taste great, but vegetables formed into meat analogs don’t hold the same appeal. Maybe I’m not alone based on declining sales. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) share price is up 48% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 31% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 23% in the last year.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 23% in the last twelve months. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 6% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

40,59b0bf18-8993-3f20-9fb7-382ce8ce22f1,CCI,2023-07-10,Dividend Powerhouses: 7 Stocks to Outrun Inflation and Grow Your Wealth,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dividend-powerhouses-7-stocks-outrun-013745995.html,1688434665,STORY,"['PNW', 'DOC', 'IP', 'CCI', 'KMI']","[I’m willing to bet every reader of this article is sick and tired of inflation, which, although falling, remains above 4%. It has hurt stock portfolios, the economy overall, and seems to exact its toll everywhere you go. The good news is dividend stocks to beat inflation offer one method by which investors can safely navigate through it. Dividends pay periodic cash that acts as a counterbalance to rising prices. In this case, all of the shares listed below include a dividend exceeding 4%. Therefore, they effectively erase the negative effects of inflation currently running at 4%. Further, the stocks listed below each represent equity in stable firms which are almost guaranteed to continue, one, continue paying dividends, and two, grow your investment. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStocks to Beat Inflation: Physicians Realty Trust (DOC)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comREIT stocks (real estate income trust) like Physicians Realty Trust (NYSE:DOC) consistently offer income to investors. They own and/or finance real estate which, in general, is an appreciating asset. Therefore, investors have come to expect returns over the long run. REITs are also required to pay at least 90% of taxable annual income back to investors in the form of dividends. Given those factors, the allure becomes clearer. But at the same time, the real estate sector is known for volatility and risks that can seemingly mount out of nowhere. In turn, what once seemed like a strong investment can quickly sour. But here’s the important point as it relates to Physicians Realty Trust: Investing in less-risky areas of real estate can shield investors. DOC stock is exactly that. Healthcare properties are more stable given the inelastic demand for healthcare in general. People spend on healthcare at a relatively constant pace even as the economy sours. In short, DOC shares fit that bill. It also pays a dividend yielding 6.67% that was last reduced in 2017. Story continuesStocks to Beat Inflation: Kinder Morgan (KMI)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is a midstream/downstream oil firm. That means it owns and operates oil pipelines, storage facilities, and terminals that form the infrastructural backbone of the energy industry. That infrastructure spans the continental U.S. and offers relative stability due to the ongoing necessity of energy transportation. That isn’t to say that Kinder Morgan isn’t without risk. The company did reduce its dividend in 2016 after a period of excess leverage and equity issuance to fund expansion. It worked until it didn’t: slumping oil prices in 2015 caused a cascading effect that led to the dividend reduction. The company basically got the message and reduced debt, began self-funding, and in essence, smartened up. It currently offers a dividend yielding 6.57%. The relative recent reduction might cause investor fear but the company has instituted changes that make it less-risky overall. The dividend more than covers inflation at current levels, which again, goes a long way currently. Stocks to Beat Inflation: International Paper (IP)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockInternational Paper (NYSE:IP) manufactures paper and packaging products. It’s the kind of stock in a ‘boring’ company that screams dividend overall, but more likely a low-yield dividend. That’s arguably why International Paper is so interesting. It is a stable firm and investors can leverage that stability to outpace inflation, and is another one of the top stocks to beat inflation.IP stock includes a dividend yielding a 5.9% forward rate. The company reduced the dividend after spinning off its printing papers business in 2022. There’s positive news here as it relates to the dividend, though. Management argued that it would reduce the dividend in line with the decrease in printing papers business line revenues – 15-20%. The goal was to result in a payout ratio between 40-50%. It’s currently at 41%, on the low end. Therefore, it’s reasonable to anticipate that IP will slowly increase the dividend given it has plenty of room left to reach that 50% payout ratio. IP isn’t particularly interesting to talk about when discussing investments with friends but that doesn’t matter when it steadily pays income. Crown Castle (CCI) sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) offers something that investors seem to be more and more interested in these days: A stock investment in infrastructure and income. The income side of that equation is obvious. Crown Castle pays a dividend yielding 5.52%. It is also a REIT, having become one in 2014. I won’t beat a dead horse here, you understand why it makes sense in the context of this article. The infrastructure it owns is in cell towers. Crown Castle operates more than 40,000 cell phone towers and 85,000 miles of fiber in the U.S. In general, the push toward 5G domestically offers a great opportunity for the firm and has put in into the spotlight. The dividend payout ratio is high but has come down drastically since 2017. Importantly, it did not reduce its dividend even as payouts soared then. In fact, it hasn’t reduced its dividend since it reorganized as a REIT back in 2014.Phillip Morris (PM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockPhillip Morris (NYSE:PM) can certainly help investors grow their wealth. The tobacco stock offers what its competitors offer: A strong dividend that provides income for investment as the company pivots toward a new era. Cigarette smoking is out, or at least much less common than it used to be. Health campaigns hav ehad their intended effect. That has left tobacco titans like Phillip Morris pivoting toward a more modern suite of products. Those products go by differing names like smoke-free tobacco and reduced-harm products but it all points to one truth: Phillip Morris and others need to find products other than cigarettes through which to sell tobacco. That pivot toward novel tobacco revenue sources is an opportunity for investors. Dividends across the sector remain steadily high as an enticement for those willing to ride out the pivot. PM stock includes a dividend above 5%. And the transition is working with revenues growing by 3.5% in Q1 and smoke free revenues up by 14.5%(1). Ennis (EBF)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockEnnis (NYSE:EBF) pioneered the business of business forms, labels, tags, folders, and envelopes over a century ago. A normal reaction to the company’s 4.9% dividend might naturally be that it’s an enticement for investment into a dying business. A sort of trap, of you will. Digital products have long been available and print businesses have been in decline for quite some time. Yet, Ennis has found a way to navigate the transition. It offers custom-specification products to its customers. Big deal, right? But the kicker here is that more thna 90% of its revenues is now attributable to that particular part of its business. Had it continued to do what it made it name in, it likely would have failed. It didn’t, and it’s now the better for having adapted. Revenues are growing and earnings are steady. It’s a simple company executing a strategy that has allowed it to adapt and pays investors nicely for believing in that narrative.  Pinnacle West (PNW)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockPinnacle West (NYSE:PNW) is an Arizona-based utilities that poroduces and distributes electricity to over 25% of the state’s households. Its 4.2% yield is pretty much exactly in line with inflation, effectively mitigating its overall effects. PNW shares are oversold currently, at $81,  based on their target price of $78.40. So, it’s arguable that investors might wait for prices to fall below that threshold before establishing a stake. That’s fine but what’s also important to know here is that Pinnacle West is a regulated utility firm meaning its customer base and operating rights are essentially ensured. No other firms are going to but in on its territory because it is simply mandated that they cannot by law.  The result is that Pinnacle West doesn’t truly face competition in the typical capitalist sense. It all means stable, predictable business and the ability to pay dividends with high, high predictability. If Pinnacle West isn’t the exact right utility by which to gain those benefits there are plenty of other such utility firms that offer a similar risk profile and business opportunity. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Skyworks Solutions, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$1.4b ÷ (US$8.8b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Skyworks Solutions has an ROCE of 18%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 13% generated by the Semiconductor industry. Check out our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions roceIn the above chart we have measured Skyworks Solutions' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Skyworks Solutions here  for free.So How Is Skyworks Solutions' ROCE Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Skyworks Solutions, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 30% over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Skyworks Solutions' ROCEIn summary, Skyworks Solutions is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 19% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Skyworks Solutions  that we think you should be aware of.While Skyworks Solutions isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The benchmark S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) is up nearly 15% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) has risen just 1.7%.Friday's jobs report showed the US economy added 209,000 jobs in June, missing Wall Street estimates and reflecting a slowdown from the previous month, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed Friday.The unemployment rate now stands at 3.6% while hourly wages rose 4.4% over the same month last year.Economists and market strategists were largely in agreement that although nonfarm payrolls decreased from May, the 0.1% drop in unemployment and a continued increase in hourly wages warrant additional action from the Fed.""The Fed would need to see more evidence of a sustained cooling of wage growth for it to stay on the sidelines,"" economists at Oxford Economics wrote on Friday. ""That was not evident in the latest jobs report, which included another month of sturdy wage increases. Workers are still in the driver’s seat as labor conditions, while easing, remain historically tight.""Story continuesEntering the week, data from the CME Group showed investors pricing in a ~93% chance the Fed raises rates this month and a roughly 40% chance at least two more 0.25% rate hikes are announced by the central bank through November.This week will shape expectations around the Fed's longer term plans, with CPI data expected to show a continued slowdown in inflation pressures. Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 3.1% annually in June, a slowdown from the 4% rise seen in May. May's data was the slowest year-over-year inflation reading since April 2021. Prices are set to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to rise 5% over last year in June, a slowdown from the 5.3% increase seen in May. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%.""We look for the core CPI to downshift alongside a decline in core goods prices,"" Wells Fargo's team of economists wrote on Friday.""The ongoing improvement in supply chains has helped to ease pressure on goods, and we expect vehicle prices to contract in June. At the same time, core services are likely to stay firm. Shelter inflation is only slowly cooling off, while medical care and recreational services have scope to rebound in June. The Fed will welcome the continued moderation in price growth, though the road back to 2% inflation remains long.""On the corporate side, earnings from Delta Air Lines (DAL) and PepsiCo (PEP) are expected on Thursday, followed by a slew of earnings from the financial sector on Friday morning with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citi, and BlackRock all set to report.Investors will be keenly focused on how banks continue to grapple with the fallout from this spring's bank failures and the subsequent deposit drains across the system. As ever, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's comments on the state of the US economy and banking sector will be closely monitored.""JPM could surprise to the upside in terms of the revenue synergies from the [First Republic] deal,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Richard Ramsden wrote in a note on July 5. ""WFC should benefit from less capital markets exposure, given expected weakness in these businesses in the quarter, as well as potentially better, idiosyncratic margin trends.""JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon looks on during the inauguration the new French headquarters of JP Morgan bank in Paris, France June 29, 2021.

(NYSE:PFE) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 5th of September, with investors receiving $0.41 per share. This makes the dividend yield 4.6%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer Pfizer's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, Pfizer's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 37.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 54%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendPfizer Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.88 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.64. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.4% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Pfizer has grown earnings per share at 7.1% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.Pfizer Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Pfizer might even raise payments in the future. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

But healthcare is a space that remains highly skeptical, according to a new GE HealthCare (GEHC) survey.At least 55% of medical professionals say AI is not ready for medical use, the international GE survey revealed. Of those asked, 42% globally — and only 26% in the US — think AI can be trusted. The survey included 7,500 clinicians, such as doctors, physician assistants, and public health medics, as well as patients and patient advocates in eight countries.GE HealthCare's chief technology officer Dr. Taha Kass-Hout, who has been an advocate of AI and technology's use in health care, said he understands the apprehension found in the study, which was also reflected in recent work by BMJ, a medical journal. (""The risks associated with medicine and healthcare include the potential for AI errors to cause patient harm (and) issues with data privacy and security,"" said BMJ.)...the experience sucks. Getting data out [is] really, really hardDr. Taha Kass-Hout, GE HealthCare's CTOKass-Hout said it is important to start addressing the needs and pain points of clinicians, who have often had to deal with technology that is not intuitive or easy to use for the work they do. Electronic health records, also known as electronic medical records (EMRs), are a prime example.""Right now, you have techies designing the systems. EMR is the system of record for the data, and aggregating all that information. But every clinician has to go there and, I mean, the experience sucks. Getting data out (is) really, really hard,"" Kass-Hout said.Bringing clinicians into the fold as systems are designed is also key, especially since 42% of those surveyed said they are actively looking to leave the industry.The departures are a result of significant burnout from the pandemic and a general shift in overall job satisfaction. AI implementation could push many workers, especially older ones, over the edge.Story continuesWorld's first installation and clinical use of GE Healthcare’s Discovery IGS 730 at the Lille University Hospital in France. (Business Wire)But, he pointed out, there are already many areas where AI is being used successfully, including medical imaging and collecting and analyzing health data.Kass-Hout noted that radiologists, for example, can spend several hours dissecting layers and angles of images in order to help target the exact location of cancer. AI could cut the search down to 15-20 minutes.""You can imagine now, that time will go back to the radiologists. So we're really....working on heavy lifts and problems that we are solving in this clinical workflow,"" he said.But he also knows that trust is a huge barrier, both for patients and clinicians. Thirty-nine percent of patients said they don't feel their health data is kept safe, according to the GE survey.""Training is very important. It's not just about giving them a manual to read,"" Kass-Hout said.Meanwhile, there is widespread concern about how to regulate AI at large, and the FDA is grappling with how to regulate the use of AI and digital tools in the industry. New rules could go a long way in helping workers feel more comfortable with the new technology.That said, Kass-Hout is hopeful AI will be adopted easily and soon.""When Fahrenheit invented the thermometer,"" he said, ""it took 100 years for it to be adopted and trusted. Hopefully, it won't take 100 years for AI.""Follow Anjalee Khemlani on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

According to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), the EV giant sold 93,680 vehicles in China during June, up 18.72% on the year.The Texas-based company's strong sales in China were the second-largest there behind China-based challenger BYD (SZ:002594) (OTC:BYDDY) - which itself sold more than 250,000 EVs in June, marking a surge of 88.16% year over year, according to the CPCA.Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ:LI), a Chinese startup, achieved a significant milestone in June 2023 by delivering over 32,575 vehicles, surpassing the 30,000 monthly delivery mark for the first time. This achievement reflects a growth rate of 150.1% as compared with the previous year. Notably, the company's second-quarter deliveries reached an impressive 86,533 vehicles, showcasing a year-over-year increase of 201.6%. These outstanding figures have already exceeded Li Auto's total vehicle deliveries for the entirety of 2022.Rival EV startup Nio (NYSE:NIO) delivered 10,707 vehicles in June - a 17.4% drop from the same time last year, but a significant 74% increase from numbers reported in May. That brought its 2Q total to 23,520 vehicles.Xpeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV), a Chinese automaker headquartered in Guangzhou, Guangdong with offices in California, reported 8,620 EVs delivered in June, bringing their 2Q total to 23,205 units, representing a quarter-over-quarter increase of 27%. As of June 30, 2023, Xpeng has delivered over 300,000 EVs.Story continuesBack in the U.S., Ford (NYSE:F) maintained a top spot with the help of their combustion engine trucks. The Detroit-based company's electric vehicle sales also continue to grow. According to Ford's release, EV sales dropped 2.8% compared with last year, but were up 11.9% year to date at 25,709 units. Its EV model Mustang Mach-E suffered from factory disruptions, with the vehicle's sales reportedly sinking 21.1% in the second quarter to 8,633 (down 20.6% year to date). However, following the retooling of its plant in Cuautitlán Izcalli, Mach-E sales jumped in June, indicating potential growth for third quarter.“Our EV sales continue to grow,” said Andrew Frick, vice president, sales distribution, and trucks. “Improved Mustang Mach-E inventory flow began to hit at the end of Q2 following the retooling of our plant earlier this year, which helped Mustang Mach-E sales climb 110% in June.”General Motors (NYSE:GM) reported a 19% year-over-year sales gain Wednesday, and dominated the U.S. auto industry in sales for the first half with 1.3 million vehicles sold. The automaker reported selling 36,322 electric vehicles, 33,659 of which were Bolt and Bolt EUV vehicles.GM's EV revolution meets red tapeGM has dominated the U.S. auto sales market, but the company may also have to contend with U.S. regulators. The company announced Wednesday that it could face compliance challenges under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed vehicle emissions rules and other state and federal regulations.According to comments submitted to the EPA by GM, there are six state and federal regulations that ""could require each automaker to exceed 50% EVs in at least a dozen vehicle averaging sets in the approximate 2030 timeframe.""GM said it is ""concerned that either a potential lack of clarity or a lack of coordination across the agencies may hinder an automaker’s ability to remain in compliance, year after year, across each of these regulatory programs even while meeting EPA’s overall EV targets.""The Detroit automaker, which pledged in 2021 to halt the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, said Wednesday that it is confident ""in its approach to transition to 50% EVs by 2030, and towards 100% in 2035, but our ability to meet such precise EV shares in every applicable averaging set in each model year is less clear.""The EPA said in April the proposed reduction targets for the period 2027-2032 are projected to cut emission by 56% compared with the existing 2026 requirements, or 13% annual average pollution cuts. The EPA further estimates that by 2030, approximately 60% of newly manufactured vehicles will be electric and that, by 2032, this number will rise to 67%.Rivian's shocking price sagaRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), another American EV startup, was told Monday that they would have to face a lawsuit brought by Sjunde AP-Fonden, on behalf of shareholders from Nov. 10, 2021 to March 10, 2022.The suit alleges that the electric automaker purposely underpriced its electric vehicles, leading to unpopular price hikes in order for it to stay afloat.U.S. District Judge Josephine Staton indicated that shareholders can attempt to demonstrate that Rivian, despite being unprofitable, had foreknowledge of the need to raise prices on its R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck due to higher materials costs.Following Rivian's decision to increase the price of the R1S and R1T on March 1, 2022, the company experienced a 39% decline in its share price over a span of 10 days. This move triggered dissatisfaction among customers, who expressed their frustration on social media and other platforms. Two days later, Rivian reversed its decision and announced that customers who had pre-ordered vehicles prior to March 1 would not be subjected to the higher prices.In her July 3 decision, Judge Staton called the alleged higher costs a ""major obstacle to profitability unique to Rivian,"" not merely a ""garden-variety"" problem.""The inference that Rivian senior executives knew that the [bill of materials] cost for each R1 EV exceeded its retail price by approximately $40,000 leading up to the IPO is far more plausible than the inference that those executives were in the dark about the issue,"" Staton added.Related ArticlesTesla, Ford, GM report hefty deliveries; shareholders vs. Rivian: This week in EVsFrance upbeat on attracting major Tesla investment - Le Maire'Chinese storm' looming over Europe's EV sector, Renault chairman warns]"
52,59b0bf18-8993-3f20-9fb7-382ce8ce22f1,PNW,2023-07-10,Dividend Powerhouses: 7 Stocks to Outrun Inflation and Grow Your Wealth,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dividend-powerhouses-7-stocks-outrun-013745995.html,1688434665,STORY,"['PNW', 'DOC', 'IP', 'CCI', 'KMI']","[I’m willing to bet every reader of this article is sick and tired of inflation, which, although falling, remains above 4%. It has hurt stock portfolios, the economy overall, and seems to exact its toll everywhere you go. The good news is dividend stocks to beat inflation offer one method by which investors can safely navigate through it. Dividends pay periodic cash that acts as a counterbalance to rising prices. In this case, all of the shares listed below include a dividend exceeding 4%. Therefore, they effectively erase the negative effects of inflation currently running at 4%. Further, the stocks listed below each represent equity in stable firms which are almost guaranteed to continue, one, continue paying dividends, and two, grow your investment. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStocks to Beat Inflation: Physicians Realty Trust (DOC)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comREIT stocks (real estate income trust) like Physicians Realty Trust (NYSE:DOC) consistently offer income to investors. They own and/or finance real estate which, in general, is an appreciating asset. Therefore, investors have come to expect returns over the long run. REITs are also required to pay at least 90% of taxable annual income back to investors in the form of dividends. Given those factors, the allure becomes clearer. But at the same time, the real estate sector is known for volatility and risks that can seemingly mount out of nowhere. In turn, what once seemed like a strong investment can quickly sour. But here’s the important point as it relates to Physicians Realty Trust: Investing in less-risky areas of real estate can shield investors. DOC stock is exactly that. Healthcare properties are more stable given the inelastic demand for healthcare in general. People spend on healthcare at a relatively constant pace even as the economy sours. In short, DOC shares fit that bill. It also pays a dividend yielding 6.67% that was last reduced in 2017. Story continuesStocks to Beat Inflation: Kinder Morgan (KMI)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is a midstream/downstream oil firm. That means it owns and operates oil pipelines, storage facilities, and terminals that form the infrastructural backbone of the energy industry. That infrastructure spans the continental U.S. and offers relative stability due to the ongoing necessity of energy transportation. That isn’t to say that Kinder Morgan isn’t without risk. The company did reduce its dividend in 2016 after a period of excess leverage and equity issuance to fund expansion. It worked until it didn’t: slumping oil prices in 2015 caused a cascading effect that led to the dividend reduction. The company basically got the message and reduced debt, began self-funding, and in essence, smartened up. It currently offers a dividend yielding 6.57%. The relative recent reduction might cause investor fear but the company has instituted changes that make it less-risky overall. The dividend more than covers inflation at current levels, which again, goes a long way currently. Stocks to Beat Inflation: International Paper (IP)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockInternational Paper (NYSE:IP) manufactures paper and packaging products. It’s the kind of stock in a ‘boring’ company that screams dividend overall, but more likely a low-yield dividend. That’s arguably why International Paper is so interesting. It is a stable firm and investors can leverage that stability to outpace inflation, and is another one of the top stocks to beat inflation.IP stock includes a dividend yielding a 5.9% forward rate. The company reduced the dividend after spinning off its printing papers business in 2022. There’s positive news here as it relates to the dividend, though. Management argued that it would reduce the dividend in line with the decrease in printing papers business line revenues – 15-20%. The goal was to result in a payout ratio between 40-50%. It’s currently at 41%, on the low end. Therefore, it’s reasonable to anticipate that IP will slowly increase the dividend given it has plenty of room left to reach that 50% payout ratio. IP isn’t particularly interesting to talk about when discussing investments with friends but that doesn’t matter when it steadily pays income. Crown Castle (CCI) sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) offers something that investors seem to be more and more interested in these days: A stock investment in infrastructure and income. The income side of that equation is obvious. Crown Castle pays a dividend yielding 5.52%. It is also a REIT, having become one in 2014. I won’t beat a dead horse here, you understand why it makes sense in the context of this article. The infrastructure it owns is in cell towers. Crown Castle operates more than 40,000 cell phone towers and 85,000 miles of fiber in the U.S. In general, the push toward 5G domestically offers a great opportunity for the firm and has put in into the spotlight. The dividend payout ratio is high but has come down drastically since 2017. Importantly, it did not reduce its dividend even as payouts soared then. In fact, it hasn’t reduced its dividend since it reorganized as a REIT back in 2014.Phillip Morris (PM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockPhillip Morris (NYSE:PM) can certainly help investors grow their wealth. The tobacco stock offers what its competitors offer: A strong dividend that provides income for investment as the company pivots toward a new era. Cigarette smoking is out, or at least much less common than it used to be. Health campaigns hav ehad their intended effect. That has left tobacco titans like Phillip Morris pivoting toward a more modern suite of products. Those products go by differing names like smoke-free tobacco and reduced-harm products but it all points to one truth: Phillip Morris and others need to find products other than cigarettes through which to sell tobacco. That pivot toward novel tobacco revenue sources is an opportunity for investors. Dividends across the sector remain steadily high as an enticement for those willing to ride out the pivot. PM stock includes a dividend above 5%. And the transition is working with revenues growing by 3.5% in Q1 and smoke free revenues up by 14.5%(1). Ennis (EBF)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockEnnis (NYSE:EBF) pioneered the business of business forms, labels, tags, folders, and envelopes over a century ago. A normal reaction to the company’s 4.9% dividend might naturally be that it’s an enticement for investment into a dying business. A sort of trap, of you will. Digital products have long been available and print businesses have been in decline for quite some time. Yet, Ennis has found a way to navigate the transition. It offers custom-specification products to its customers. Big deal, right? But the kicker here is that more thna 90% of its revenues is now attributable to that particular part of its business. Had it continued to do what it made it name in, it likely would have failed. It didn’t, and it’s now the better for having adapted. Revenues are growing and earnings are steady. It’s a simple company executing a strategy that has allowed it to adapt and pays investors nicely for believing in that narrative.  Pinnacle West (PNW)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockPinnacle West (NYSE:PNW) is an Arizona-based utilities that poroduces and distributes electricity to over 25% of the state’s households. Its 4.2% yield is pretty much exactly in line with inflation, effectively mitigating its overall effects. PNW shares are oversold currently, at $81,  based on their target price of $78.40. So, it’s arguable that investors might wait for prices to fall below that threshold before establishing a stake. That’s fine but what’s also important to know here is that Pinnacle West is a regulated utility firm meaning its customer base and operating rights are essentially ensured. No other firms are going to but in on its territory because it is simply mandated that they cannot by law.  The result is that Pinnacle West doesn’t truly face competition in the typical capitalist sense. It all means stable, predictable business and the ability to pay dividends with high, high predictability. If Pinnacle West isn’t the exact right utility by which to gain those benefits there are plenty of other such utility firms that offer a similar risk profile and business opportunity. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at News’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for News What Is News Worth?Great news for investors – News is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $31.16, but it is currently trading at US$19.71 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because News’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of News look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for News. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since NWSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NWSA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy NWSA.

In recent months, The Los Angeles Times newspaper announced that it is eliminating 13% of its staff due to declining advertising revenue. BuzzFeed News announced it is shutting down its operations entirely. Hundreds of journalists who work for Gannett Co. (NYSE:GCI), the largest newspaper publisher in the U.S., have gone on strike to demand an end to ongoing cost-cutting measures.According to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, the U.S. media industry has announced more than 17,400 job cuts so far in 2023, the highest number of cuts on record. Many of the job losses have been at smaller community newspapers and local news stations, which are struggling financially.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsYet it’s not all doom and gloom. Amid the carnage, a select few media companies are thriving thanks to a combination of strong content and savvy business moves. These publicly traded companies are worth consideration, given the outperformance of their share prices. Here are the three best media stocks to buy for July 2023.Thomson Reuters (TRI)newspapers folded and arranged in row like books on a shelf. gray background.Source: ShutterstockThomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) is a highly successful global news organization despite a declining industry. Toronto-headquartered Thomson Reuters owes its success to the 2008 acquisition of the British company Reuters Group. This move gave it the Reuters News Agency, a newswire that spans the globe. It has 2,500 journalists and 600 photographers stationed at 200 bureaus around the world. Literally billions of people view Reuters news coverage each day. It clients include eight of the top 10 global newspapers and every U.S. TV network.Media outlets are shrinking in size by closing news bureaus and laying off staff. Consequently, they are increasingly relying upon Reuters news stories to provide content. This has led to strong earnings and share price appreciation for TRI. For this year’s first quarter, the company reported that its revenue grew 4% year over year to $1.7 billion. Its operating profit increased 23% to $508 million, while its free cash flow rose 58% to $133 million. Thomson Reuters also maintained its 2023 outlook despite a slowing economy.Story continuesTRI stock is up 25% over the last 12 months and has gained 188% in the past five years.New York Times Co. (NYT)The headquarters of the New York Times (NYT) at night.Source: Osugi / Shutterstock.comNicknamed the “Gray Lady” for its serious tone, The New York Times (NYSE:NYT) is one of the few media companies to have successfully transitioned its news coverage online. Currently, 9.7 million worldwide subscribers read the Times,  710,000 of whom subscribe to print, while the other nine million read digital. The New York Times is clearly profitable from its subscriptions alone. This fact makes the company less reliant on advertising revenue, which can be cyclical and prone to ups-and-downs.In Q1 of this year, NYT reported its ad revenue fell 8.6% to $106 million, dragged lower by declines in advertising among technology and finance companies. However, the Times added 190,000 net new digital subscribers in the quarter, helping to offset the drop in ad spending. Increasingly, The New York Times is becoming a multi-media company, adding podcasts, video documentaries, and even animation to its news coverage.In 2022, the company bought the popular online sports news site The Athletic for $550 million. They are beginning to offer it to readers in bundled subscriptions. The Times recently reported that The Athletic had 3.3 million subscribers in Q1, more than double the number it had a year earlier. NYT stock has risen 42% in the last 12 months, including a 20% gain so far this year. Over five years, the stock is up 51%.News Corp. (NWSA)News Corp.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 67% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.NVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 5.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is the owner of 3.5% of the company's shares.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. Insiders own US$42b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with NVIDIA , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn’t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia’s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time.

Despite the sharp run up, we believe the company’s long-term runway remains compelling due to its advantaged positioning in a very large addressable market for GPUs.

Unfortunately, 70% of Nvidia's meager cash yield of 0.45% is further eroded by stock-based compensation (SBC) for its employees and management. The company's stock compensation plan consumes $2.8 billion of the company's $28 billion annual revenue but shares outstanding have not decreased. Nvidia's market capitalization is 37% greater than Berkshire Hathaway. However, when comparing fundamentals, Berkshire Hathaway generated $23 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters while Nvidia generated only $2.6 billion (SBC adjusted). Furthermore, Berkshire Hathaway does not dilute shareholders with stock-based compensation. Despite a wide array of available investment options, market participants have overwhelmingly favored a select few dominant technology companies.At its current price of $423, Nvidia is valued at forty times its annual revenue. If one heroically assumes that the company manages to compound revenue by 50% per year for three years, it will ""only"" trade at a multiple of twelve times hypothetical sales in 2026...hardly a screaming bargain. Of course, market history has an interesting way of repeating itself. The most exaggerated technology bubble occurred in 1928-29 when the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) captured the imagination of every speculator on Wall Street. RCA's trading volume sometimes accounted for 20% of the total volume on the New York Stock Exchange. At the stock price peak in September 1929, the company was ""valued"" at $665 million. Sales increased from $65 million in 1927 to $102 million in 1928 to $182 million in 1929. Therefore, at the peak of the RCA stock buying frenzy, the company was ""valued"" at a multiple of ""only"" 3.6 revenue. Forty-five years later, in 1974, RCA's annual sales were $4.6 billion, yet the stock price bottomed that year at $38, about one-third of its 1929 stock price high.?While most rational investors consider Nvidia 'slightly' overvalued, market momentum could push fantasy valuations higher. Comparing the 1929 period of RCA and the current situation with Nvidia in 2023, one observes a similar pattern where most stocks experience decline while a handful of large companies powered the major indices higher.

(NYSE:APD) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$805.2m-US$674.7mUS$2.39bUS$3.76bUS$4.87bUS$5.90bUS$6.81bUS$7.59bUS$8.25bUS$8.80bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 29.38%Est @ 21.20%Est @ 15.47%Est @ 11.46%Est @ 8.66%Est @ 6.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% -US$745-US$578US$1.9kUS$2.8kUS$3.3kUS$3.7kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$4.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$27bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.1%) = US$151bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$151b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$70bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$96b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$287, the company appears quite good value at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Air Products and Chemicals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.999. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Air Products and ChemicalsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatPaying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney How Much Debt Does Walt Disney Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Walt Disney had US$48.5b of debt in April 2023, down from US$52.0b, one year before. However, it also had US$10.4b in cash, and so its net debt is US$38.1b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Walt Disney's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Walt Disney had liabilities of US$28.1b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$66.4b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$10.4b in cash and US$12.8b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$71.3b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This deficit isn't so bad because Walt Disney is worth a massive US$162.0b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Walt Disney has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 4.8 times. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. It is well worth noting that Walt Disney's EBIT shot up like bamboo after rain, gaining 31% in the last twelve months. That'll make it easier to manage its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Walt Disney can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. In the last three years, Walt Disney's free cash flow amounted to 30% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt.Our ViewOn our analysis Walt Disney's EBIT growth rate should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. However, our other observations weren't so heartening. For example, its net debt to EBITDA makes us a little nervous about its debt. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about Walt Disney's debt levels. While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can view this interactive graph of Walt Disney's earnings per share history for free.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

75,5f30fa00-f115-3855-9ec8-9dda21aef7e9,CL,2023-07-10,7 Stocks to Buy Now if You Still Think a Recession Is Ahead,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-still-002204359.html,1688430124,STORY,"['SRE', 'KR', 'FIVE', 'ADM', 'WTRG', 'WM', 'CL']","[Preparing for a recession at this juncture seems a ridiculous concept at this juncture. As CNBC pointed out late last week, the Federal Reserve’s key inflation measure showed that prices increased by just 0.3% in May, favorably below expectations. Put another way, disinflation is occurring which means that recession-proof stocks are only for worrywarts, right?Well, maybe not. While the inflation data is encouraging, it’s also worth pointing out that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Biden’s plan to forgive student debt. That will likely weigh on discretionary retail sectors as affected individuals face a harsh reality check. Thus, it’s still a good idea to at least consider safe stocks in a recession.Also, credit card debt hit a record high, implying that the Covid-19 pandemic failed to teach financial prudence. Should circumstances go awry, many if not most households lack the wherewithal to navigate effectively. Therefore, the below recession stocks to buy remain relevant despite the latest headline numbers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRecession-Proof Stocks: Waste Management (WM)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the case for Waste Management (NYSE:WM) as one of the recession-proof stocks to buy practically sells itself. As the leading provider of waste and environmental services in North America, the company commands a serious moat. You can’t just ask for land for the purpose of making a landfill. Therefore, Waste Management enjoys an entrenched natural monopoly.On the financial side, about the only major source of hesitation toward WM as a vehicle for investing during a recession is the valuation prospect. Trading at a forward multiple of 28.64, acquiring WM commands a hefty premium since the underlying sector’s median forward price-earnings ratio is only 19.23 times.Nevertheless, what I appreciate about WM is its strong three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 9.5%. This stat beats out 60.71% of its peers. Unsurprisingly, the company benefits from consistent profitability. As a result, it’s one of the safe stocks in recession because everybody generates trash, downturn or not.Story continuesRecession-Proof Stocks: Colgate-Palmolive (CL)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAnother almost self-explanatory case for recession-proof stocks to buy, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is a major player in the personal care segment. Fundamentally, what I appreciate about Colgate is its namesake products for toothcare. Irrespective of whether a recession materializes or not, people will brush their teeth. It’s also one of the easiest processes involved regarding preventative care.Regarding the financial aspect, Colgate again suffers a similar dilemma to Waste Management. Basically, as one of the more obvious ideas for recession stocks to buy, several folks have already piled into CL. Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 24.62. In contrast, the underlying sector median stat is 16.63 times. Thus, we’re talking about a sizeable premium.On the other hand, Colgate also benefits from consistent profitability, making it an appropriate idea if you’re preparing for a recession. Put another way, business predictability should command its own premium during a down cycle.Recession-Proof Stocks: Kroger (KR)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker StocksSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAgain, Kroger (NYSE:KR) presents an intuitive canvas for recession-proof stocks to buy. As a major player in the supermarket segment, Kroger stands to benefit from the trade-down effect. This concept involves consumers trading down their common purchases for cheaper alternatives (rather than going cold turkey). By logical deduction, Kroger represents a trade-down for consumers who previously went out to restaurants or ordered food deliveries.Financially, Kroger presents a very intriguing argument for investing during a recession. Sure, the company only features a trailing-year net margin of 1.71%, which is slightly worse than the sector median of 1.82%. At the same time, Kroger carries a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.3%, outpacing nearly 70% of sector rivals.Most enticingly, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of 10.44. As a discount to projected earnings, Kroger ranks better than 83.08% of enterprises in the defensive retail space. Also, it trades at 0.23 times trailing sales, favorably below 69.9% of its peers. Thus, it’s one of the safe stocks in recession.Five Below (FIVE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comWhile I’m a big fan of discount dollar stores as a frontline strategy for recession-proof stocks, they can also be problematic. Let’s face reality: dollar stores tend to be grimy affairs that might not attract customers during non-recession years. Fortunately, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) fills a nice niche in the discount retail space.Offering products priced mostly at five bucks but also select products that run to $25, Five Below delivers a bargain and a touch of class. Therefore, it should be relevant irrespective of whatever’s happening with the economy.On a financial basis, Five Below benefits from a strong three-year revenue growth rate of 18.8%, above 80.44% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate clocks in at 18.6% during the same period. Additionally, concerned investors will likely appreciate Five Below’s consistent profitability. To be fair, FIVE carries a rich premium to both earnings and sales. Still, if circumstances go awry, Five Below will likely swing much higher from here.Sempra Energy (SRE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Speaking of natural monopolies, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) commands one of the most lucrative. First, Sempra of course represents a major player in the public utility space. No matter what happens with the market or the economy, you must still pay your bills. And not that I know from personal experience but these folks hunt you down if you forget to pay.Second, Sempra serves large portions of the Southern California market, which isn’t surprising given its San Diego headquarters. As you know, California – despite its criticisms – is the economic engine of this nation. By logical deduction, Sempra serves the residents of this economic engine. Stated differently, it’s going to get its bills paid, downturn or no downturn.Therefore, SRE easily ranks among the recession-proof stocks to buy. In all fairness, Sempra’s financials leave much to be desired on paper. However, the biggest takeaway is that it’s consistently profitable, which isn’t a shocker. Thus, put shares on your radar if you’re investing during a recession.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) offers a complete portfolio of ingredients and solutions to meet any taste and a commitment to sustainability, according to its corporate profile. As with the other recession-proof stocks to buy, the case for ADM truly sells itself. If you want to know, it’s that humans obviously have to eat.What’s really interesting about ADM centers on its value proposition. A cursory glance at its business model will reveal that ADM presents an obvious case for safe stocks in recession. You’d think people would be all over Archer Daniels. Instead, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of only 11.34. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 76.52% of its peers.In addition, Archer features a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.4%, beating out 76.67% of entities in the consumer packaged goods space. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same frame clocks in at an impressive 30.8%. Thus, it’s one of the recession stocks to buy.Essential Utilities (WTRG)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comBased in Pennsylvania, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) is one of the largest publicly traded water, wastewater, and natural gas providers in the U.S. Per its public profile, it serves approximately 5 million people across 10 states under the Aqua and Peoples brands. Essential is committed to excellence in proactive infrastructure investment, regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and environmental stewardship.Despite what should be a clear case for recession-proof stocks to buy, Essential suffered badly so far this year. Since the January opener, WTRG slipped more than 17%. Even with that magnitude of red ink, shares appear overvalued against both trailing and forward earnings.Still, Essential carries one of the most important attributes when it comes to investing during a recession: consistent profitability. Also, it packs a stout top line with a three-year revenue growth rate of 28.3%, beating out 91.87% of its peers. On a final note, analysts peg WTRG as a moderate buy with a price target of $50.50. That implies almost 27% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Comcast’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Comcast What's The Opportunity In Comcast?Great news for investors – Comcast is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $64.69, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Another thing to keep in mind is that Comcast’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What does the future of Comcast look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Comcast. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CMCSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CMCSA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CMCSA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you'd like to know more about Comcast as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

79,456f3111-5302-3292-bfba-34b953710a35,ORCL,2023-07-10,Oracle Corporation's (NYSE:ORCL) institutional investors lost 3.8% over the past week but have profited from longer-term gains,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-corporations-nyse-orcl-institutional-130047667.html,1688907647,STORY,['ORCL'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Oracle's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 3 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 44% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 3.8% in value last week. Still, the 62% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. But they would probably be wary of future losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Oracle. See our latest analysis for Oracle ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Oracle?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Oracle does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Oracle, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthOracle is not owned by hedge funds. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Oracle's case, its Top Key Executive, Lawrence Ellison, is the largest shareholder, holding 42% of shares outstanding. With 5.1% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 3 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company's shares, implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of OracleThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Oracle Corporation. Insiders own US$132b worth of shares in the US$311b company. That's quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Oracle. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Oracle better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Oracle (including 1 which is a bit concerning) .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Brands fair value estimate is US$99.25Yum! Brands is estimated to be 34% overvalued based on current share price of US$133 The US$147 analyst price target for YUM is 48% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Yum! Brands The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.69bUS$1.85bUS$1.98bUS$2.08bUS$2.17bUS$2.25bUS$2.33bUS$2.39bUS$2.46bUS$2.52bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x2Est @ 6.70%Est @ 5.32%Est @ 4.36%Est @ 3.68%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.65%Est @ 2.49% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.4% US$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.4%– 2.1%) = US$35bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$35b÷ ( 1 + 9.4%)10= US$14bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$28b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$133, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Yum! Brands as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.221. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Yum! BrandsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For Yum! Brands, we've put together three fundamental factors you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Yum!

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Coca-Cola is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$12b ÷ (US$97b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Coca-Cola has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Beverage industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Coca-Cola compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Coca-Cola.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsOver the past five years, Coca-Cola's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Coca-Cola to be a multi-bagger going forward. That being the case, it makes sense that Coca-Cola has been paying out 67% of its earnings to its shareholders. These mature businesses typically have reliable earnings and not many places to reinvest them, so the next best option is to put the earnings into shareholders pockets.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWe can conclude that in regards to Coca-Cola's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 56% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.If you want to continue researching Coca-Cola, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Coca-Cola isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Coca-Cola Consolidated's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola Consolidated is:37% = US$455m ÷ US$1.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.37 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Coca-Cola Consolidated's Earnings Growth And 37% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Coca-Cola Consolidated has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 17% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, Coca-Cola Consolidated's considerable five year net income growth of 52% was to be expected.Story continuesWe then compared Coca-Cola Consolidated's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 7.9% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is COKE worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether COKE is currently mispriced by the market.Is Coca-Cola Consolidated Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Coca-Cola Consolidated has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 4.2%, meaning that it has the remaining 96% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Moreover, Coca-Cola Consolidated is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Coca-Cola Consolidated's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

As CNBC pointed out late last week, the Federal Reserve’s key inflation measure showed that prices increased by just 0.3% in May, favorably below expectations. Put another way, disinflation is occurring which means that recession-proof stocks are only for worrywarts, right?Well, maybe not. While the inflation data is encouraging, it’s also worth pointing out that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Biden’s plan to forgive student debt. That will likely weigh on discretionary retail sectors as affected individuals face a harsh reality check. Thus, it’s still a good idea to at least consider safe stocks in a recession.Also, credit card debt hit a record high, implying that the Covid-19 pandemic failed to teach financial prudence. Should circumstances go awry, many if not most households lack the wherewithal to navigate effectively. Therefore, the below recession stocks to buy remain relevant despite the latest headline numbers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRecession-Proof Stocks: Waste Management (WM)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the case for Waste Management (NYSE:WM) as one of the recession-proof stocks to buy practically sells itself. As the leading provider of waste and environmental services in North America, the company commands a serious moat. You can’t just ask for land for the purpose of making a landfill. Therefore, Waste Management enjoys an entrenched natural monopoly.On the financial side, about the only major source of hesitation toward WM as a vehicle for investing during a recession is the valuation prospect. Trading at a forward multiple of 28.64, acquiring WM commands a hefty premium since the underlying sector’s median forward price-earnings ratio is only 19.23 times.Nevertheless, what I appreciate about WM is its strong three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 9.5%. This stat beats out 60.71% of its peers. Unsurprisingly, the company benefits from consistent profitability. As a result, it’s one of the safe stocks in recession because everybody generates trash, downturn or not.Story continuesRecession-Proof Stocks: Colgate-Palmolive (CL)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAnother almost self-explanatory case for recession-proof stocks to buy, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is a major player in the personal care segment. Fundamentally, what I appreciate about Colgate is its namesake products for toothcare. Irrespective of whether a recession materializes or not, people will brush their teeth. It’s also one of the easiest processes involved regarding preventative care.Regarding the financial aspect, Colgate again suffers a similar dilemma to Waste Management. Basically, as one of the more obvious ideas for recession stocks to buy, several folks have already piled into CL. Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 24.62. In contrast, the underlying sector median stat is 16.63 times. Thus, we’re talking about a sizeable premium.On the other hand, Colgate also benefits from consistent profitability, making it an appropriate idea if you’re preparing for a recession. Put another way, business predictability should command its own premium during a down cycle.Recession-Proof Stocks: Kroger (KR)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker StocksSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAgain, Kroger (NYSE:KR) presents an intuitive canvas for recession-proof stocks to buy. As a major player in the supermarket segment, Kroger stands to benefit from the trade-down effect. This concept involves consumers trading down their common purchases for cheaper alternatives (rather than going cold turkey). By logical deduction, Kroger represents a trade-down for consumers who previously went out to restaurants or ordered food deliveries.Financially, Kroger presents a very intriguing argument for investing during a recession. Sure, the company only features a trailing-year net margin of 1.71%, which is slightly worse than the sector median of 1.82%. At the same time, Kroger carries a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.3%, outpacing nearly 70% of sector rivals.Most enticingly, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of 10.44. As a discount to projected earnings, Kroger ranks better than 83.08% of enterprises in the defensive retail space. Also, it trades at 0.23 times trailing sales, favorably below 69.9% of its peers. Thus, it’s one of the safe stocks in recession.Five Below (FIVE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comWhile I’m a big fan of discount dollar stores as a frontline strategy for recession-proof stocks, they can also be problematic. Let’s face reality: dollar stores tend to be grimy affairs that might not attract customers during non-recession years. Fortunately, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) fills a nice niche in the discount retail space.Offering products priced mostly at five bucks but also select products that run to $25, Five Below delivers a bargain and a touch of class. Therefore, it should be relevant irrespective of whatever’s happening with the economy.On a financial basis, Five Below benefits from a strong three-year revenue growth rate of 18.8%, above 80.44% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate clocks in at 18.6% during the same period. Additionally, concerned investors will likely appreciate Five Below’s consistent profitability. To be fair, FIVE carries a rich premium to both earnings and sales. Still, if circumstances go awry, Five Below will likely swing much higher from here.Sempra Energy (SRE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills.

First, Sempra of course represents a major player in the public utility space. No matter what happens with the market or the economy, you must still pay your bills. And not that I know from personal experience but these folks hunt you down if you forget to pay.Second, Sempra serves large portions of the Southern California market, which isn’t surprising given its San Diego headquarters. As you know, California – despite its criticisms – is the economic engine of this nation. By logical deduction, Sempra serves the residents of this economic engine. Stated differently, it’s going to get its bills paid, downturn or no downturn.Therefore, SRE easily ranks among the recession-proof stocks to buy. In all fairness, Sempra’s financials leave much to be desired on paper. However, the biggest takeaway is that it’s consistently profitable, which isn’t a shocker. Thus, put shares on your radar if you’re investing during a recession.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) offers a complete portfolio of ingredients and solutions to meet any taste and a commitment to sustainability, according to its corporate profile. As with the other recession-proof stocks to buy, the case for ADM truly sells itself. If you want to know, it’s that humans obviously have to eat.What’s really interesting about ADM centers on its value proposition. A cursory glance at its business model will reveal that ADM presents an obvious case for safe stocks in recession. You’d think people would be all over Archer Daniels. Instead, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of only 11.34. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 76.52% of its peers.In addition, Archer features a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.4%, beating out 76.67% of entities in the consumer packaged goods space. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same frame clocks in at an impressive 30.8%.

The platform includes dual PCs and a quick-refresh camera that ensure fast and reliable performance and data processing.Another feature of the guidance system is that it is implant agnostic, which means that it can work with any implant that the surgeon chooses. This gives the surgeon more flexibility and options, enabling the facilities to meet the needs of the entire service line using one platform.The system also supports different surgical approaches, such as anterior, posterior, or lateral hip replacement, or partial or total knee replacement.The advanced guidance system has a Triathlon implant dedicated software, designed for Stryker's Triathlon knee implants.

As CNBC pointed out late last week, the Federal Reserve’s key inflation measure showed that prices increased by just 0.3% in May, favorably below expectations. Put another way, disinflation is occurring which means that recession-proof stocks are only for worrywarts, right?Well, maybe not. While the inflation data is encouraging, it’s also worth pointing out that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Biden’s plan to forgive student debt. That will likely weigh on discretionary retail sectors as affected individuals face a harsh reality check. Thus, it’s still a good idea to at least consider safe stocks in a recession.Also, credit card debt hit a record high, implying that the Covid-19 pandemic failed to teach financial prudence. Should circumstances go awry, many if not most households lack the wherewithal to navigate effectively. Therefore, the below recession stocks to buy remain relevant despite the latest headline numbers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRecession-Proof Stocks: Waste Management (WM)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the case for Waste Management (NYSE:WM) as one of the recession-proof stocks to buy practically sells itself. As the leading provider of waste and environmental services in North America, the company commands a serious moat. You can’t just ask for land for the purpose of making a landfill. Therefore, Waste Management enjoys an entrenched natural monopoly.On the financial side, about the only major source of hesitation toward WM as a vehicle for investing during a recession is the valuation prospect. Trading at a forward multiple of 28.64, acquiring WM commands a hefty premium since the underlying sector’s median forward price-earnings ratio is only 19.23 times.Nevertheless, what I appreciate about WM is its strong three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 9.5%. This stat beats out 60.71% of its peers. Unsurprisingly, the company benefits from consistent profitability. As a result, it’s one of the safe stocks in recession because everybody generates trash, downturn or not.Story continuesRecession-Proof Stocks: Colgate-Palmolive (CL)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAnother almost self-explanatory case for recession-proof stocks to buy, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is a major player in the personal care segment. Fundamentally, what I appreciate about Colgate is its namesake products for toothcare. Irrespective of whether a recession materializes or not, people will brush their teeth. It’s also one of the easiest processes involved regarding preventative care.Regarding the financial aspect, Colgate again suffers a similar dilemma to Waste Management. Basically, as one of the more obvious ideas for recession stocks to buy, several folks have already piled into CL. Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 24.62. In contrast, the underlying sector median stat is 16.63 times. Thus, we’re talking about a sizeable premium.On the other hand, Colgate also benefits from consistent profitability, making it an appropriate idea if you’re preparing for a recession. Put another way, business predictability should command its own premium during a down cycle.Recession-Proof Stocks: Kroger (KR)Man holding stacks of money.

94,2878f68e-416c-3b29-a543-8d0cf23e0266,VLO,2023-07-10,Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 81% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-corporation-nyse-vlo-110024563.html,1688986824,STORY,['VLO'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Valero Energy implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price51% of the business is held by the top 22 shareholdersUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyEvery investor in Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Valero Energy. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Valero Energy?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Valero Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Valero Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Valero Energy is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.8% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.2% and 7.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Valero EnergyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Valero Energy Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$193m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Valero Energy  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Remember, 2023’s strong first-half performance was primarily a result of gains from just half a dozen companies — mostly buzzy tech names like Meta.So what are the top stock plays for the market’s youngest generation of investors? We put that question to some Yahoo Finance Live regulars, and it turns out, some of the year's first-half winners are among the best buys.AI frenzy: Nvidia and Microsoft AI-related stocks have skyrocketed this year, and two stocks among the biggest winners of the latest investor frenzy still have room to run, pros contend.""All the rage this year and going forward is and will be AI,"" Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management told Yahoo Finance Live, naming Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) as his top picks for Gen Z investors.Nvidia’s growing dominance in the AI chip race and Microsoft’s $10 billion investment in OpenAI have helped propel these two stocks since the start of the year, with shares surging 195% and 42% respectively.That first-mover advantage is what’s going to keep these stocks among the leaders of the AI boom, according to Mahoney. Finding leaders in particular fields with stocks trading at a fair value is always key in investing, an important reminder for Gen Z investors surveying the landscape.""We see the market really ramping into Nvidia and Microsoft as they will be at the forefront of this AI revolution,"" Mahoney added. ""While Nvidia’s P/E is high, there aren’t any other cars speeding as fast down the highway.""Story continuesEV Boom: Tesla To no one's surprise, Tesla (TSLA) should be a top stock pick for Gen Z investors, according to Jay Woods, Freedom Capital Markets' chief global strategist.You've got to invest in a company that you believe in, and ""they [Gen Z] love the cars, the technology and Elon Musk,"" Woods told Yahoo Finance Live.The stock has more than doubled this year, surging about 125% since the start of January. That blistering rally has prompted a handful of analysts to move to the sidelines. But despite skepticism about its current valuation, many still see a long-term opportunity for the next generation of investors seeking to own what they know and trust (in this example, Tesla).Barclays analyst Dan Levy, who downgraded the stock last month, wrote in a client note that the team still sees ""Tesla as the long-term winner amongst carmakers in the race to an EV world,"" while Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said Tesla is still a ""must own"" in the auto space.Sounds ripe for the picking for Gen Zers.The Building Out of America: Lennar, D.R. HortonHomebuyers are turning to new home construction amid a shortage in the resale market, and that’s boosting homebuilder stocks, a trend that Portfolio Wealth Advisors CEO Lee Munson says will stay intact for some time.Munson named Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) two top picks for Gen Z investors.""You add up delayed demand from millennials, the drop in new housing from the great financial crisis, and impossible zoning restrictions in most highly populated cities, and now demand is far outstripping supply,” Munson told Yahoo Finance Live.Munson added: ""Bottom line, if you want to bet that millions of homes need to be built, D.R. Horton and Lennar are far and above the biggest volume players.""Once again, Gen Z would be wise to own the winners taking advantage of important demand trends.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Performed by researchers from Johns Hopkins University, Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX) and eight other laboratories participating in the Quest-led Global Diagnostics Network (GDN), the analysis is believed to be the largest ever to evaluate worldwide variability in lipid levels.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated logo. (PRNewsFoto/Quest Diagnostics Incorporated)The analysis finds that people tested in seven of 17 countries had suboptimal total cholesterol levels relative to the World Health Organization (WHO) target, suggesting heightened disease risk, and that dangerous cholesterol levels reached their zenith during middle age in both sexes in most countries, although males peaked a decade earlier than females.  Published in European Heart Journal, the analysis includes medically recognized laboratory markers of cardiovascular disease risk, including levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride. The WHO and clinical practice guidelines in different countries recognize lipid testing's clinical value. Yet, little research on lipid levels has been attempted on a global scale. The new study aims to identify geographical differences to highlight and share best practices and focus global public policy resources on high-risk populations. Story continues""With nearly half a billion lipid results, this analysis included a huge scale of recent data that was examined across the globe to inform public health,"" said lead author Seth S. Martin, MD, MHS, Professor of Medicine, Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""As these results inform the conversation that patients and clinicians have when selecting therapy, the distributions observed in our study might be useful to laboratories in refining interpretative ranges and alert values.""Based on analysis of results of laboratory tests performed between 2018 and 2020, the study's key findings include:Highest total cholesterol levels in two European countries: Seven countries evaluated had mean total cholesterol levels exceeding the WHO-defined risk threshold of 5.00 mmol/L (193 mg/dL): Japan, Australia, North Macedonia, Switzerland, Germany, Slovakia, and Austria. Of these, the highest mean total cholesterol levels were in Austria (5.40 mmol/L, 208.8 mg/dL) and Germany (5.35 mmol/L, 206.9 mg/dL).Countries with lowest cholesterol levels spanned the Americas, Middle East and Asia: The countries with the lowest mean total cholesterol levels were the Republic of Korea (4.58 mmol/L, 177.1 mg/dL), Turkey (4.74 mmol/L, 183.3 mg/dL), and the United States (4.75 mmol/L, 183.6 mg/dL).The Americas region showed strikingly similar patterns, with age group-based patterns of total cholesterol in females and males remarkably similar among three countries in the Western Hemisphere (Brazil, Canada, and the United States).Differences by sex held steady in most countries, with total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels peaking in males between ages 40-49 years, roughly a decade earlier than females' peak at ages 50-59 years. Yet, a higher proportion of females than males had rates of LDL cholesterol levels at or above 4.91 mmol/L, a level the WHO considers highly elevated, in all but four countries (Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Spain and United Arab Emirates). In every country except India, total cholesterol levels among females were highest in the 50-59-year age group.North Macedonia had the highest proportions of LDL cholesterol results greater than 4.91 mmol/L (&gt;190 mg/dL) for both females (9.9%) and males (8.7%).The authors speculate that the country-based variations in test results may reflect different ""cultural dietary and physical activity patterns,"" economic conditions and access to lipid testing and treatment. The authors also cite the possible role of genetic differences between countries and give the example of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH is an inherited genetic disorder that causes dangerously elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and is estimated to affect 30 million people worldwide, with significant variability in prevalence across countries.The study involved lipid testing performed by 9 laboratories that are members of the Global Diagnostics Network, a strategic working group of 12 laboratories organized in 2018 by USA-based Quest Diagnostics, a leading U.S. provider of laboratory services, to improve global laboratory innovation, insights and quality. The members that participated in the study include Healius (Australia), DASA (Brazil), Life Labs (Canada), Strand Life Sciences (India), LSI Medience (Japan), GC Labs (Republic of Korea), Al Borg Diagnostics (Saudi Arabia), SYNLAB (Austria, Germany, North Macedonia, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom) and Quest Diagnostics (United States). Data was deidentified and aggregated by participating laboratory prior to analysis.""The GDN study is important for demonstrating what has long been suspected: that cardiovascular disease is an urgent public health problem in multiple countries, not just the U.S.A., and cultural and genetic factors likely contribute to development of this largely preventable disease,"" said co-author Harvey W. Kaufman, MD, senior medical director, Quest Diagnostics. ""We hope our study ignites greater focus of public health resources on the global problem of cardiometabolic disorders.""Strengths of the study include its uniquely large size while limitations include lack of patients' medical data to contextualize test data. While the laboratories involved in the analysis are leaders in their respective countries, their laboratory data may not fully represent any particular country or geography.Click here to access the full study online via European Heart Journal.About Heart DiseaseThe WHO states ischemic heart disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 16% of the world's total deaths. Since 2000, the largest increase in deaths has been for this disease, rising by more than 2 million to 8.9 million deaths in 2019. Advanced age, hypertension, diet, physical activity, tobacco use, overweight and obesity, diabetes, genetics and other factors influence risk.About the GDNThe Global Diagnostics Network (GDN) is a strategic working group of diagnostic laboratories, each committed to unleashing and sharing local innovation to increase global access to diagnostic science and services — ultimately generating diagnostic insights and enhancing global healthcare.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$17.2bUS$18.4bUS$16.7bUS$17.3bUS$17.3bUS$17.4bUS$17.6bUS$17.9bUS$18.2bUS$18.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.04%Est @ 0.66%Est @ 1.09%Est @ 1.40%Est @ 1.61%Est @ 1.76% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$15.9kUS$15.7kUS$13.2kUS$12.6kUS$11.7kUS$10.9kUS$10.2kUS$9.5kUS$8.9kUS$8.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$117bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$310bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$310b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$141bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$258b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$51.0, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.025. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Cisco SystemsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.
