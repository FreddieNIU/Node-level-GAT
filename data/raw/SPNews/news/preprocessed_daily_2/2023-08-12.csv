Though this does not offer dramatic price appreciation, the strategy is a major source of consistent income for investors in any market.This is especially true as dividend-focused products offer safety in the form of payouts and stability through mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. Dividend-paying securities are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from equity markets are at risk. Further, these products are proven outperformers over the long term.While there are plenty of options in the dividend ETF world, zeroing in on the dividend aristocrats could be a wise move in the current market environment, which has been ruffled by concerns over slower economic growth (read: 5 ETFs to Buy for Safety &amp; Stability Amid Market Downturn).Why Dividend Aristocrats?Dividend aristocrats are blue-chip dividend-paying companies with a long history of increasing dividend payments year over year. These generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis. Additionally, aristocrats tend to skew the portfolio to less-volatile sectors and mature companies.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These companies have a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates a likely hike in the future.Investors should note that the dividend aristocrat funds offer more dividend growth opportunities compared to the other products in the space but might not necessarily have the highest yields. Further, these products lead to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to the simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields.As a result, these products provide a nice combination of annual dividend growth and capital appreciation opportunity, and are mainly suitable for risk-averse, long-term investors. For them, we have highlighted some popular ETFs that could be excellent choices:Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is the largest and the most popular ETF in the dividend space, with AUM of $69.3 billion and an average daily volume of 979,000 shares.

Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF holds 314 securities in the basket, with key holdings in technology, industrials, healthcare, financials and consumer discretionary. The fund charges 6 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.SPDR S&amp;P Dividend ETF (SDY)With AUM of $22 billion, SPDR S&amp;P Dividend ETF provides well-diversified exposure to 121 U.S. stocks that have consistently increased their dividend for at least 20 consecutive years.

PVH (PVH), which belongs to the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 28%.For the last reported quarter, PVH came out with earnings of $2.14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.93 per share, representing a surprise of 10.88%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.38 per share, delivering a surprise of 45.12%.For PVH, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.PVH has an Earnings ESP of +1.02% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Cintas What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Story continuesGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.55bUS$1.71bUS$2.02bUS$2.09bUS$2.25bUS$2.38bUS$2.48bUS$2.58bUS$2.66bUS$2.74bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.48%Est @ 4.48%Est @ 3.78%Est @ 3.29%Est @ 2.95% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.2%) = US$62bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$62b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$32bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$48b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$490, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cintas as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.907. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for CintasStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

8,96041aff-1e56-3a0e-8456-3af99afde42d,WMT,2023-08-12,Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) Upcoming Dividend Will Be Larger Than Last Year's,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmarts-nyse-wmt-upcoming-dividend-120553609.html,1691841953,STORY,['WMT'],"[The board of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.57 on the 2nd of January, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. The payment will take the dividend yield to 1.4%, which is in line with the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Walmart's earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 81.9% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 31% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.88 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.28. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.9% over that duration. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Walmart has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.9% per year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Walmart Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Walmart that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip stocks, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Out of these, a mere handful manages to catch public attention due to a variety of factors. These firms can either be popular household names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), firms that have created new industries like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or companies that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and are known for their financial stability and strength.Firms at the top of the stock market food chain are often referred to as Blue Chip stocks. The term 'Blue Chip' is more than a century old, and as you might have guessed, it comes from poker where players assign a monetary value to chips and then gamble on them with cards. A blue chip stock in the 1920s would typically have a share price greater than $200 and the term was coined by a reporter for Dow Jones. These days, there are no fixed criteria to define a firm as a blue chip, however, the typical classification normally includes the 30 stocks included in the Dow 30 index.Investing in blue chip stocks typically offers a variety of benefits that one might be unable to accrue when investing in other stocks such as penny stocks or small cap stocks. These firms are typically quite resilient to significant share price drops due to their size and stability, and their popularity also provides the market with plenty of liquidity. Not to mention, several blue chip stocks also pay dividends. We took a closer look at blue chip firms with large market capitalization and stable dividend growth as part of our 12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy coverage and determined that the top dividend paying stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesAugust is an important month for the stock market as it will see several large firms report their earnings for the second quarter of 2023. These earnings come at a time when high interest rates take their toll on corporate spending, but lowering inflation provides consumers with more leeway to make expensive purchases. To add to this, the earnings also provide important hints about the current state of the U.S. economy, to enable analysts and economists to determine whether a recession might materialize just when everybody starts looking the other way.One blue chip stock that reported its earnings in August is Apple. The largest technology company in the world saw its quarterly revenue drop for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the revenue for the first three quarters also fell. However, Apple still beat analyst EPS estimates due to lower costs in administrative and other expenses. Another blue chip firm and one whose sales are closely watched to measure consumer spending power is Coca-Cola. It is the largest beverage company in the world and one that had a strong second quarter as it managed to beat analyst EPS estimates by a wide margin. Coca-Cola reported $12 billion in net revenues for the quarter, which marked a 6% annual growth. The results indicated that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation, and the revenue growth also enabled Coca-Cola to report a 34% GAAP EPS growth.However, for the beverages company, the biggest takeaway from its second quarter of 2023 earnings was not the revenue or the EPS figures. Instead, it was Coca-Cola's guidance, as the company upgraded its non-GAAP revenue guidance to predict an 8% to 9% organic growth for the full year 2023. Corporate guidance is a crucial factor in an earnings season like the one we're currently in the middle of. This is because firms have a real time view of their operations which leaves them in a better position to predict future outcomes. These outcomes, when put together, can also provide the tea leaves to make a prediction of the broader economic performance.Joining Coca-Cola as an important company whose earnings guidance and financial performance are also an economic barometer is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The retailer has direct contact with consumers due to its business model, and while it has not reported its latest earnings, investment bank Credit Suisse has some good news for the stock as it has increased Walmart's share price target to $180 from $170. Credit Suisse believes that Walmart is positioned well to handle any volatility in consumer spending as its entire approach is based on providing customers with value.With this context, let's take a look at the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to Wall Street.

11,42b440ec-00a3-3d13-bdab-782e2777b072,WMT,2023-08-12,Retail Earnings Looming: What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-earnings-looming-expect-213500799.html,1691789700,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'TGT', 'WMT', 'AMZN']","[Walmart WMT and Target TGT shares lost roughly a quarter of their value in response to the disappointing April-quarter results on May 17th and 18th, 2022.Leading up to May 2022, these two stocks had performed roughly in line with each other, with Walmart slightly doing better than Target and both outperforming in the S&amp;P 500 index.Target shares never got their mojo back after the May 2022 beating and have actually lost ground in response to each of the following four quarterly releases. Walmart shares have had the opposite behavior, with the stock steadily gaining ground following subsequent quarterly releases.The performance comparison of these two stocks since the beginning of May 2022 clearly tells the story, as the chart below shows. Please note that we added the S&amp;P 500 index to the mix (the green line) to the chart.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis performance context is important to keep in mind as we look ahead to the Target and Walmart quarterly results this week, the former before the market’s open on Wednesday, August 16th, and Walmart the day after on Thursday morning (August 17th).Walmart's quarterly EPS estimates coming into this report have been very stable, with the current Zacks Consensus of $1.67 per share unchanged over the past two months. Unlike Walmart, there has been notable pressure on Target estimates, with analysts cutting their estimates on continued near-term challenges. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for Target of $1.49 is down from $1.57 a month ago, $1.58 two months ago, and $1.94 three months back.The stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart’s ‘value orientation’ allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers ‘trade down’ during times of ‘economic stress.’One key point of differentiation between these two retail giants is Walmart’s bigger grocery business which gives its results greater stability given the ‘staply’ nature of that otherwise low-margin business. The relatively low-margin nature of groceries notwithstanding, they bring in foot traffic and are also responsible for the aforementioned ‘trade down’ phenomenon that is helping Walmart gain share.Story continuesAnalysts see relatively greater momentum in Walmart’s business on the back of higher average selling prices and flat traffic, gains on the e-commerce side, and better margin results relative to what they reported last on May 18th. Target is seen as suffering from weak traffic during the period, with the price trend only marginally positive.Both companies struggled with evolving consumer behavior as the pandemic entered the rearview mirror. We saw this in their April 2022 quarterly results that we referenced at the top of this note, for which the market punished them.While both took drastic steps to steady their floundering ships, Walmart clearly did a better job adjusting to the new environment than Target. The ‘shrinkage’ aspect of inventory was also front and center when Target put a dollar number on the phenomenon the last time around. However, market participants appreciate that this aspect of ‘inventory shrink’ is hardly restricted to Target.With respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 19 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the realm in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor’s standard industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon (AMZN) and restaurant players. The 19 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q2 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q2 earnings for these 19 retailers that have reported are up +49% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues, with 78.9% beating EPS estimates and 52.6% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, the online players and restaurant operators easily beat earnings expectations but struggled with beating revenue estimates.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 19 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q2 earnings were up +526% on +10.8% higher revenues, beating top-and-bottom-line expectations.As we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q2 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne recurring theme in the Q2 earnings season has been the continued resilience and stability of the U.S. consumer. We heard this from the banks, the leisure and hospitality players, and consumer-facing digital operators.There is undoubtedly stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. Other issues, like the resumption of student loan payments, are seen as weighing on spending trends. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.We will hear more about that on the Walmart and Target earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods. But on the whole, consumer spending trends remained intact in 2023 Q2, and these results will reconfirm.Q2 Earnings ScorecardAs of Friday, August 11th, we have seen Q2 results from 457 S&amp;P 500 members, or 91.4% of the index’s total membership. The Q2 reporting cycle has now come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors.We have more than 300 companies reporting results this week, including 17 S&amp;P 500 members. The notable companies reporting this week include, besides the aforementioned Walmart and Target, include Home Depot, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, Deere &amp; Co.Total Q2 earnings for the 457 S&amp;P 500 members are down -9.5% from the same period last year on +0.48% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 65.2% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts nevertheless put the Q2 results from these 457 index members with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 457 index members in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Earnings Big Picture The chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q2, the following three quarters, and actual results for the preceding four quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the -8.2% decline for Q2 earnings on -0.2% lower revenues is the blended growth picture for the quarter, which combines the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies.As you can see in this chart, Q2 is on track to be the third quarter in a row of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. As noted earlier, a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector.Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -2.1% on +4.6% higher revenues.The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, 2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressures expected to be in the Energy, Medical, Basic Materials, and Construction sectors.With the earnings focus lately on the Tech sector, it is instructive to see how much distance has been covered on the margins front in this key sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tech Sector’s Earnings Outlook Reflects Improvement  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""What has been left out is discretionary goods, things like consumer electronics, apparel, home-related products.""Lasser outlines how investors will be eyeing the performance of big-ticket retail items and increased sales driven by price hikes. He shares his outlook on Walmart's omnichannel approach for shoppers and Target's inventory concerns.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: The focus is going to be on retail next week with some of the sector's biggest names set to report earnings results. Walmart, Target, and Home Depot are among the companies that will give us a closer look at the health of the consumer and some of the shopping trends.Here to break it all down, we want to bring in Michael Lasser, UBS retail analyst. Michael, it's great to see you. Before we get into individual names, just first give us your sense of the consumer because we've been talking about for months and months and months that the consumer has been so resilient. Is that going to be the case this earnings season?- I think this earnings season we're going to see a mixed picture of the consumer. The consumer has had to spend more money to buy basic necessities like food, household products given all the inflation that's happened over the last year. At the same time, the consumer has increasingly wanted to spend on things like vacations, concerts, going out to eat, and that's also been more expensive.What has been left out is discretionary goods. Things like consumer electronics, apparel, home-related products. And we are likely to see the composition of this spend in the upcoming reports of these retailers. Now, the question is, what happens in the back half of the year and in the next year as some of this excess savings work down, the labor market becomes a little less certain. And so I'm expecting mixed results and a cautious tone from some of these retailers as the pressures linger on the consumer.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, it feels like it's more of a continuation of some of the narrative that we've heard from some of these big-box retailers. You know, those like Target as well as Walmart over the last few quarters talking about consumers spending more on groceries less on big ticket items as well. What are you going to be looking for when they report next week in terms of where things are likely to go? I mean, to your point consumers are still spending, but it is services over goods.MICHAEL LASSER: Yeah. So here's a couple of things we're going to be looking for. Number one, is the pressure on those big ticket items, is it starting to stabilize? Meaning is it just not getting worse even though it might not be getting better. Because obviously, that would be a prelude to an eventual recovery in those big ticket discretionary items.Number two, a lot of these retailers because they report their sales in nominal dollars, they've been seeing significant growth simply from raising prices. So what is the outlook for seeing growth from either more people going to their stores buying more products while they're there because they're going to rely less on raising prices as a way to drive growth into the back half of the year? So those are going to be two critical areas to watch as we get into the reporting season over the next few weeks.SEANA SMITH: So Michael, Walmart is one of the names that you cover. It's been able-- it's been faring relatively well given some of the pressure that consumers have been under-- a number of consumers have been trading down. How do you think Walmart is then positioned in this environment?MICHAEL LASSER: I think Walmart is positioned really well. Not only because consumers have been trading into Walmart because Walmart is as good of a retailer as any to help consumers stretch their budgets, but also Walmart's been more effective at doing things like rolling out Walmart Plus to make it easier and more cost effective to do online shopping and delivery of online purchases.They've been expanding their assortment into more value-oriented products. I think all of those factors along with some price inflation, and the contribution from rapidly expanding demand of weight loss drugs, GLP-1 drugs, all of that's going to contribute to very strong sales for Walmart in the second quarter.The most likely case, though, is they take a prudently cautious outlook for the back half of the year. The stock is in a nice run. We think it's in the midst of a continued appreciation cycle. We like the stock. From here we would own it not only into the earnings report but also for the longer term as well.SEANA SMITH: How does that compare with somebody like Target? So Target has more of a lean to discretionary categories like home, consumer electronics, apparel. It also has less exposure to fresh food. So it's mix is going to act as a drag on its total performance in the quarter.And we expect that with that being said, it's been recovering from some of the inventory disposition that it incurred last year. Really the key for target here is what does the ongoing long-term profitability of this business look like? We think as the sales stabilize and it continues to execute its strategy, which is to make it easy to do business with Target, we're going to see that its profitability is much higher than where it is today. And as that comes into view, that's going to be very bullish for the stock.SEANA SMITH: Michael, retail shrink-- when we speak of Target, they were the one company that said that they could take up to a $500 million hit in its profits because of retail shrink. And we heard it from a number of Target competitors really across the retail landscape last quarter. Have retailers at all-- have they been able to mitigate some of this pressure, and what do you think that pressure then looks like still?MICHAEL LASSER: Well, so we think it's going to still be a source of pressure. We don't think it's going to get worse. We don't think it's going to get that much better. But shrink has proven to be cyclical over time, especially during difficult periods where the consumer is facing a lot of pressure. The consumer is more likely to engage in malicious acts, and that's in addition to some of the more cyclical challenges that have occurred with organized retail crime.Our view is that as we move into 2024, these retailers are going to act more aggressively, deploy more strategies to try and address the shrink. If that's not successful and it doesn't work, they're simply going to close some of these stores because it's not going to be economical to run those locations that are being most afflicted from this issue.It is a industry-wide issue, but we think it does get better eventually. And Target, as you rightfully mentioned, is the one that has the most leverage to the upside as shrink gets better.AKIKO FUJITA: One of many factors no question investors are going to be focused on when those results start to come in next week.MICHAEL LASSER: No doubt.AKIKO FUJITA: Michael Lasser, thanks so much for joining us today.MICHAEL LASSER: Have a wonderful weekend.]"

Walmart (WMT) stock rises, locking in a fourth record close this month, as the company is set to report earnings next week. Chinese ADRs slide over concerns about China's real estate sector. Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita discuss the top stocks to watch.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right. Well, let's take a look at some of the individual movers of the day. And first up, we got to start with GM and Ford, both under pressure amid labor contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers. As the September expiration date for the contracts approaches, fears of a strike are beginning to creep in. We saw that reflected not only today but really the weekly moves that we saw in both stocks here, Akiko.And I think the thought process is, at least the thinking along the lines of some of the analysts out there is that the workers, the unions might have the upper hand in this type of environment. Wells Fargo is out with a note saying that the expiring UAW contract on September 14 is the most imminent risk to GM and Ford, calling the demands audacious and really raising that risk of a strike.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, there's two-fold, right, Seana? On the one hand, there's the risk of a strike and how much that would cost to the carmakers if there is a work stoppage. There's also the realization that if they do reach some kind of contract, that's going to mean higher expenses. For these companies, you had that number out from Bloomberg this week saying that it would add more than $80 billion in expenses for each one of these American car companies.When you consider what exactly the UAW is asking for right now in their contracts, and you don't need to look further than UPS to understand where those higher costs are going to come from. They averted a strike, and yet they had expenses go up significantly as a result of the higher wages, more benefits, all of that.Story continuesSo it feels like when you look at these carmakers, there's a bit of a lose-lose situation. But certainly, investors are not looking for a strike here, but either way, looking at higher costs as a result of these negotiations. Shares of Walmart closing higher, locking in a fourth record close this month. The company also gearing up to report its quarterly results next week.Seana, we were talking to UBS' Michael Lasser earlier about the strength that Walmart has when you compare it to some of its competitors. There's a lot of expectation riding on these results in part because of Walmart's mix and where consumers are right now. You talked about Target not being a little more discretionary. Walmart in a stronger position when it comes to fresh foods, sort of these key items that consumers are going for right now, increasingly seeking out value. You could argue Walmart is in a stronger position in that space and certainly, higher expectations here going into next week's results.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. There certainly are higher expectations, especially on the heels of what we heard last quarter from these two companies, like you were just saying there, Akiko. Target, obviously, when you compare it to the position of Walmart, Walmart in a stronger position than Target just given Target's heavier reliance on some of those more discretionary items.But when it comes to Walmart and what we are expecting, Credit Suisse maintaining their outperform rating on the stock, also raising their price target to $180 this year. They are very confident just in terms of Walmart's positioning right now, what those returns will potentially look like.It was interesting though to me what we heard from Michael Lasser just about the outlook. He expects a cautious outlook here from Walmart. Despite the fact that he thinks they are going to be able to weather some of the downturn, some of the cautious consumer, at least in the coming months, he would not be surprised if we do get a cautious guidance here from Walmart given some of those macro pressures.All right. Also Chinese ADRs sliding today as concerns over China's real estate sector is coming to the forefront yet again. Country Garden issuing a profit warning, deepening fears over China's property sector, this coming two years after we had the Evergrande group's default. When you take a look at the losses across the board, Akiko, I know you're following this very closely, but really just highlights the troubling economy that China faces right now. The fact that we haven't seen this recovery pick up steam, like we initially anticipated. And obviously, some of that has to do with the massive weakness that we're seeing within the property sector.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah I mean, when you think about Country Garden the reason we're so focused on that is because that's the last of the big developers that have been able to avoid a default up until now. And when you think about this incredible growth that we have seen from China over the years, not over the last few years but over the years, it has been on the back of real estate. These developers taking on massive loads of debt to expand in a big way.And what we saw with Country Garden reporting saying they expected a loss of $7.6 billion over the first six months of the year, a lot of investors thinking back to what happened with Evergrande, and that has really brought back in the jitters there. You see Alibaba, JD.com, Baidu, all the big Chinese AVRs, they're pulling back in a big way. And by the way, Country Garden traded over in Hong Kong, seeing massive losses on the day on the back of these numbers.]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

21,ca7e9690-02b5-30cd-a354-b358f39ac9da,MET,2023-08-12,Why MetLife (MET) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-metlife-met-great-dividend-154511266.html,1691768711,STORY,['MET'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.MetLife in FocusHeadquartered in New York, MetLife (MET) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -13.42% so far this year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.52 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.32%. This compares to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.1% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.62%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.08 is up 5.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.44%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. MetLife's current payout ratio is 33%, meaning it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MET expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.75 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 13.14%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That pushed Russia's seaborne crude shipments to $64.41 a barrel on a weighted average, the IEA said, above the $60 cap agreed upon by G7.""Tightening physical balances in the wake of Saudi output cuts and lower Russian loadings added additional momentum to the price rebound, pushing crude forward curves deeper into backwardation,"" the IEA said in its monthly oil market report.Researchers also noted that higher crude prices, combined with narrowing discounts for Russian grades, boosted Russia's export revenues up by $2.5 billion to $15.3 billion in the month.Still, that figure remains about $4.1 billion below the levels reached at the same time in 2022. Russia's oil exports averaged about 7.3 million barrels a day in July, according to the IEA.Last year, Western nations imposed the price cap in an attempt to keep Russian supplies on the market while curbing Russia's ability to fund its war in Ukraine.Historically one of the biggest oil exporters in the world, an all-out ban on Russian supplies would likely cause too severe a supply shock and oil price spike.As far as the price cap mechanism, companies can only move Russian oil if they pay less than $60 a barrel. One key consequence has been the emergence of China and India as big buyers of discounted barrels.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip stocks, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Out of these, a mere handful manages to catch public attention due to a variety of factors. These firms can either be popular household names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), firms that have created new industries like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or companies that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and are known for their financial stability and strength.Firms at the top of the stock market food chain are often referred to as Blue Chip stocks. The term 'Blue Chip' is more than a century old, and as you might have guessed, it comes from poker where players assign a monetary value to chips and then gamble on them with cards. A blue chip stock in the 1920s would typically have a share price greater than $200 and the term was coined by a reporter for Dow Jones. These days, there are no fixed criteria to define a firm as a blue chip, however, the typical classification normally includes the 30 stocks included in the Dow 30 index.Investing in blue chip stocks typically offers a variety of benefits that one might be unable to accrue when investing in other stocks such as penny stocks or small cap stocks. These firms are typically quite resilient to significant share price drops due to their size and stability, and their popularity also provides the market with plenty of liquidity. Not to mention, several blue chip stocks also pay dividends. We took a closer look at blue chip firms with large market capitalization and stable dividend growth as part of our 12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy coverage and determined that the top dividend paying stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesAugust is an important month for the stock market as it will see several large firms report their earnings for the second quarter of 2023. These earnings come at a time when high interest rates take their toll on corporate spending, but lowering inflation provides consumers with more leeway to make expensive purchases. To add to this, the earnings also provide important hints about the current state of the U.S. economy, to enable analysts and economists to determine whether a recession might materialize just when everybody starts looking the other way.One blue chip stock that reported its earnings in August is Apple. The largest technology company in the world saw its quarterly revenue drop for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the revenue for the first three quarters also fell. However, Apple still beat analyst EPS estimates due to lower costs in administrative and other expenses. Another blue chip firm and one whose sales are closely watched to measure consumer spending power is Coca-Cola. It is the largest beverage company in the world and one that had a strong second quarter as it managed to beat analyst EPS estimates by a wide margin. Coca-Cola reported $12 billion in net revenues for the quarter, which marked a 6% annual growth. The results indicated that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation, and the revenue growth also enabled Coca-Cola to report a 34% GAAP EPS growth.However, for the beverages company, the biggest takeaway from its second quarter of 2023 earnings was not the revenue or the EPS figures. Instead, it was Coca-Cola's guidance, as the company upgraded its non-GAAP revenue guidance to predict an 8% to 9% organic growth for the full year 2023. Corporate guidance is a crucial factor in an earnings season like the one we're currently in the middle of. This is because firms have a real time view of their operations which leaves them in a better position to predict future outcomes. These outcomes, when put together, can also provide the tea leaves to make a prediction of the broader economic performance.Joining Coca-Cola as an important company whose earnings guidance and financial performance are also an economic barometer is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The retailer has direct contact with consumers due to its business model, and while it has not reported its latest earnings, investment bank Credit Suisse has some good news for the stock as it has increased Walmart's share price target to $180 from $170. Credit Suisse believes that Walmart is positioned well to handle any volatility in consumer spending as its entire approach is based on providing customers with value.With this context, let's take a look at the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to Wall Street.

""We are establishing a powerful global house of iconic fashion brands.""Tapestry shocked Wall Street on Thursday by announcing it will spend $57 a share to buy rival Capri Holdings (CPRI) for a total enterprise value of $8.5 billion. The transaction will see Tapestry — the steward of Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman — gain control of Versace, Michael Kors, and Jimmy Choo by sometime in 2024.Capri's stock surged 55% to $53.90 on Thursday. But Tapestry stock fell 15.93% to $34.67 as some experts began to question whether the company needed to pull the trigger and if it overpaid for Capri.Tapestry paid ""a healthy multiple on a company that I just don't think was that healthy,"" Pauline Brown, former LVMH Chairman of North America, told Yahoo Finance.Crevoiserat thinks the deal will be proven right over time as her C-suite extracts cost efficiencies from the combined company and expands it in the fast-growing Asia luxury market.Here are several high-level points from the term sheet:The purchase price for Capri marked a 39% premium to its closing price on Wednesday.$200 million in cost synergies are expected by three years after deal closes.A 17% quarterly dividend was approved despite the transaction.The deal will be funded through a mix of new debt and cash on the balance sheet.The transaction marks the next chapter for Crevoiserat at Tapestry.Crevoiserat joined Tapestry in 2019 as CFO after a successful stint at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch as CFO and COO. In October 2020, Crevoiserat was named CEO amid deep struggles for the owner of Coach and the newly acquired Kate Spade brand.A person carries a bag from the Michael Kors store on Aug. 26, 2018, in Central Valley, New York.

She also sharpened how new handbags and accessories are brought to market — and doing so has helped keep inventory under control and margins solid.Story continues""We will now have 33,000 team members across the globe,"" Crevoiserat said when reflecting on the deal and her 35-year retail career. ""I think that is a powerful opportunity, one we don't take lightly. I think it will solidify our growth going forward.""Meanwhile, the transaction also represents an ongoing current of deals in the luxury goods space.Within the last three years, LVMH (LVMUY) spent $15.8 billion to buy Tiffany &amp; Co. and $3.5 billion for a majority stake in Birkenstock.And just this year, Kering bought a 30% stake in Valentino for $1.7 billion and spent $3.8 billion to scoop up high-end fragrance maker Creed.For its part, Capri spent $2.1 billion to buy Versace in 2018 and $1.2 billion on Jimmy Choo in 2017.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Thus, you can purchase Moody's' shares before the 17th of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 8th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.77 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.08 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Moody's has a trailing yield of approximately 0.9% on its current stock price of $336.7. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Moody's's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Moody's Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately Moody's's payout ratio is modest, at just 38% of profit.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Moody's, with earnings per share up 8.2% on average over the last five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Moody's has delivered 17% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineHas Moody's got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Moody's has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. Overall, Moody's looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Moody's you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Adjusted segment revenues decreased 14%.Revenues in Move fell 24% to $146 million primarily as a result of lower real estate revenues.

Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 29% of total circulation and subscription revenues in the quarter as compared with 23% in the prior year.Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were more than 4.6 million, reflecting a 5% increase from the prior year, primarily due to the growth in streaming subscribers driven by BINGE and Kayo.

Digital revenues at Dow Jones represented 79% of total revenues compared with 76% in the prior year.Circulation and subscription revenues decreased $2 million year over year.

Digital circulation revenues accounted for 70% of circulation revenues compared with 68% in the prior year.Advertising revenues decreased 14% year over year, primarily due to 18% and 10% declines in digital and print advertising revenues, respectively.

Todays conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Michael FlorinThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call.

The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.Story continuesRobert J. ThomsonThank you, Mike. Before we discuss the results for the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2023, I'd like to acknowledge that we have now completed a decade of the new News Corp's existence. So this is surely an appropriate moment to reflect on our profound transformation, a transformation faithful to the company's founding principles. Consider the then and now. Our revenue base has changed fundamentally and expanded dramatically. News and Information Services, accounted for 72% of total revenues in fiscal 2014, which included News America Marketing and Dow Jones. By fiscal 2023, News Media was 23%, and revitalized Dow Jones segment was 22%. And Digital real estate comprised 5% of total revenues 10 years ago, and that has tripled to over 15% this past year, which includes the acquisition of Move, where revenues have more than doubled.Subscription Video services revenues increased from 6% of News Corp's total to 20%, bolstered by the consolidation and control of Foxtel, a business renewed and Foxtel's imminent completion of a refinancing is expected to facilitate repayments of our outstanding shareholder loans beginning this fiscal year. Candidly, since our reincarnation, we have increasingly digital recurring revenues, higher margins, significantly more free cash flow, robust finances and bright prospects for long-term growth and value creation for all our shareholders. A few facts to demonstrate our digital scale today. Based on our June metrics, we had 79 million unique visitors at Dow Jones, 159 million at the Sun, 74 million at realtor.com, 21 million at Housing.com in India and 145 million at the increasingly influential New York Post. And that digital momentum is surely gathering pace in the age of generative AI. Along with this relentless focus on digitization, we have been intent on simplifying the company and heightening our cost consciousness. That cost discipline was clearly evident during a year that had a complicated plot line for books, while digital real estate was naturally inevitably affected by the interest rate hikes, which appear to be plateauing in the U.S. I would like to pay sincere tribute to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and our directors who have been steadfast in their strategic support and all our employees and our loyal insightful investors. Thanks to their collective committed efforts, News Corp achieved its 3 strongest fiscal years ever in the last 3 fiscal years, 2021, 2022 and 2023. In fact, fiscal '23 was our second most profitable year following fiscal '22 despite the difficult macro conditions in a couple of core segments. And our fourth quarter profitability was significantly higher than last year. There have certainly been fundamental changes in the media landscape. We have led the quest for appropriate compensation for content from the big digital platforms. And that quest begun publicly in 2007 when I testified before the House of Lords about the challenges for publishers and society in the Internet age has entered a new fascinating phase with the rise of generative AI. Clearly, negotiations are well underway with the relevant companies. And once again, News Corp hopes to set precedents that benefit creators, publishers and journalists around the globe. It is crucial for our societies that AI is replete with EI. That recomposition does not lead to the decomposition of creativity and integrity. We have been characteristically candid about the AI challenge to publishers and to intellectual property. It is essentially a triptych. In the first instance, our content is being harvested and scraped and otherwise ingested to train AI engines. Ingestion should not lead to indigestion. Secondly, individual stories are being serviced in specific searches. And thirdly, original content can be synthesized and presented as distinct when it is actually an extracting of our editorial essence. These super snippets, distilling the effort and insight of great journalism are potentially designed so the reader will never visit a new site, thus, fatally undermining journalism and damaging our societies. It is reassuring that the prescient executives at the largest digital companies can see these complexities and understand that our shared responsibilities extend far beyond the commercial that generative AI cannot be degenerative. That we are paving a platform for future generations and that we will be collectively held to account and not just by accountants. From the philosophical to the functional, there is no doubt that AI articulations will affect most sections of most companies, whether it be customer service, subscription management, chatbots, chit-chat bots, text to audio and audio to video. Experiences, efficiencies will be exponential. And we are absolutely clear in our company, there must be a confluence of the technological, the commercial and the culture. Last earnings, I mentioned the plight of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, unjustly incarcerated by Russia for being a journalist, seeking facts, seeking the truth both the journal and the U.S. government vehemently deny the allegations against it. Evan has now spent almost 5 months in prison, and we thank the many thoughtful people from all around the globe who have rallied to his course and sought his release. And we thank those who are continuing to press determinedly for his emancipation and providing support to his courageous family. Turning now to our results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023. The aforementioned macroeconomic factors, that is inflation, supply chain complications and volting interest rates, along with volatile foreign exchange rates patently presented challenges, some of which are more ephemeral than internal. Nonetheless, we still saw significant progress across several segments. And thanks to our digital and international strategic focus and acute cost consciousness including the announced 5% headcount reduction, which we expect to yield more than $160 million in annual gross savings. Not only was this fiscal year, the second best ever in terms of profits, we believe we are poised for greater growth in the years ahead. As for the fourth quarter, revenues were over $2.43 billion, 9% lower year-over-year. Though a majority of that decline is attributable to foreign exchange rates and an extra week last year, a 53rd week to balance out the multiyear calendar. Mathematically, that 1 extra week accounts for almost half of the difference and will obviously not be a factor in the current year. Profitability in the quarter rose 8%, which is especially notable in that it comes after a 50% rise a year earlier. We are building on our positive performances even when the headwinds are blustery. Full year revenues were $ 9.879 billion, down 5% on our record prior year. And total segment EBITDA was over $1.4 billion, 15% lower, though still the second highest profits recorded for the new News Corp. Dow Jones posted its highest profitability for both the quarter and the full year since we acquired the company, helped by impressive results in the professional information business. In fact, taking a step back Dow Jones has doubled it's profitability in the past 4 years. And for the first time, Dow Jones was the highest contributor of profits across all of News Corp in fiscal 2023 as we continue to develop the higher-margin B2B offerings. We are focused on Dow Jones as a pillar of News Corp's future growth with significant value appreciation for shareholders. Dow Jones is nearing an important threshold, with the lucrative B2B business expected to be the highest contributor to profitability in fiscal 2024 and a key driver for future margin expansion. Dow Jones has been bolstered over the past year by the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical market analytics and by continuing double-digit growth of risk and compliance. It is worth noting that risk and compliance revenues have risen sixfold over the past decade. We believe prospects remain decidedly bright as the corporate imperative to minimize risk and maximize compliance, grows in an ever more complex regulatory regime. We believe the energy transition is an enormous global opportunity for Opus, and we will capitalize on it through new products, the establishment of compelling benchmarks and the generation of must-have data, pricing and analytics, whether it be for fossil fuels, hydrogen, solar, lithium, cobalt, EVs or carbon credits and offsets. The industry relies on Opus for pricing transparency which is critical to day-by-day decision-making in a market that is undergoing massive transformation. Dow Jones digital subscription growth accelerated in the second half. partly helped by bundling of our products to capitalize on our clients' needs for a sophisticated market analysis and analytics. We want to channel market watch readers to WSJ, then to Barron's and Investors Business Daily and from there to our specialist business products. That is a pathway to profits for the company. Moreover, we are increasing our international digital focus for the Wall Street Journal, which currently has only 12% of subscriptions outside the U.S., where there is much untapped potential. Subscription Video Services reported adjusted revenue and profit growth, which excludes currency impact for the second straight year and also for the fourth quarter, a remarkable turnaround from the recent past. We have long-term rights to the key Australian sports and the prime international sports for Australians and have created a model that streamers around the world are now trying to emulate. Our streaming revenue growth again outpaced broadcast declines in both Q4 and the full year, with paid subscribers scaling at a double-digit rate to nearly 3.1 million. So we are particularly confident about Foxtel's future and our optionality given the imminent completion of our refinancing. We were asked frequently in the past how much more capital we would need to commit to Foxtel. But the question now is how much cash we will receive in coming years. REA continued to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges in the Australian housing market. So we do see an easing of those challenges as the interest rate cycle peaks. Home prices have again started to increase, and the auction completion rate crossed 70% in June, up from 55% in the prior year. REA's audience share against its nearest competitor continued to expand to north of 3.5x in June. While visits to the site have expanded year-over-year for 4 consecutive months. REA did benefit from product price increases linked to improvements in the quality of those products while India remains a source of ongoing potential, given that Housing.com is already the market leader in a country on a positive economic trajectory with a rapidly expanding middle class. In the U.S., we have new leadership at Move, operator realtor.com. Move experienced much success under David Doctorow and broadened its offerings with the acquisitions of Opcity, UpNest and Avail. We sincerely thank David for his positive contribution, which will resonate for years to come, Damian Eales brings vast digital experience, a fiercely competitive spirit and much knowledge of how to leverage News Corp's powerful U.S. platforms. Whether that be the New York Post or the Wall Street Journal or Barron's to build the brand and expand market share. Damian has just returned from Australia, where the Realtor team spent time at REA and the creative collaboration between the 2 companies will certainly intensify. Scale is crucial. And to put our scale in perspective, based on June Comscore data, Realtors valuable and engaged audience is well over 2x of that of Homes.com. Not only do we have scale in residential sales, we believe that we can continue to monetize that audience successfully. For HarperCollins and for other book publishers, Q4 and fiscal '23 generally was a challenging period with the post-COVID market resetting, logistical issues at Amazon and acute inflationary pressures. Some particular signs of success were Joanna Gaines Magnolia Table Volume 3 and Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt, and we have reason for optimism in the near future with books like Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, The Collector by Daniel Silva. And in the U.K., TV, Big Adventures on the Small Screen by Peter Kay.In Q2, we are looking forward to the next Pioneer Woman Cooks by Ree Drummond and The Little Liar by Mitch Albom. In News Media, advertising trends vary distinctly by geography, with the U.K. and the U.S. performing best in the quarter. In the U.K., the Sun had a successful year with digital outpacing print ads again in the fourth quarter and for the full year. This strength was accentuated by the year-over-year growth of the Sun in the U.S. which reported a substantial surge in page views and even higher yields than the successful U.K. side. The Times and Sunday Times also hit 565,000 digital subscriptions at the end of June, an 11% increase, underscoring the strength of their journalism and the global potential of the brand. News Corp Australia achieved almost 1.1 million digital subscriptions, an increase of 10%. News.com.au was the leading news website in Australia according to the Ipsos rankings, while the Australian was also in the top 10. In the U.S., the New York Post reported another year of strong profits after decades, if not centuries, of endless losses. As I mentioned, the Papers improved commercial fortunes have been accompanied by growing influence in New York, Washington and beyond. As the papers Founder, Alexander Hamilton, safely observed those who stand for nothing fall for everything. In a fiscal year affected by the reverberations of war, inflation, interest rate hikes, supply chain disruption and other macroeconomic challenges and in a business inevitably impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations News Corp is proud to report its second most profitable year since its reincarnation a decade ago. Our teams have been tested and have clearly passed that exacting test. We ended the year on an upswing with the company returning to profit growth in the quarter with inflation showing signs of abating, interest rates plateauing and incipient signs of stability in the housing market, we have sound reasons for optimism. All specious macro conditions will surely work to the benefit of a company that has become more digital, more global and with more recurring revenues in higher-margin segments. We have navigated the sometimes perilous media waters adroitly and are particularly proud of our providence, a providence based on commitment, curiosity and integrity. We look forward with a sense of genuine of tangible excitement in the potential of our people and our businesses, and we remain utterly determined to deliver positive results for our customers, our employees and most certainly for our shareholders. I will now pass you to our erudite CFO, Susan Panuccio, who will provide more insight into our financial coordinates.Susan Lee PanuccioThank you, Robert. Our second half results show marked improvement from the first half of the year, with fourth quarter profitability up year-over-year, highlighting the diversity and durability of our revenue streams and our ongoing cost efficiencies as we navigated the ever-changing macro conditions, supply chain pressures and currency headwinds. As the company continues to transition to digital. Digital revenues now comprise over half of the company's fiscal 2023 revenues. We have also transformed the revenue base away from cyclical advertising revenues to one that is much more recurring and subscription base with strong growth prospects. We have made strategic acquisitions that we believe have fundamentally strengthened the company. The acquisitions of OPIS, CMA, HMH, Mortgage Choice and IBD during fiscal 2021 and 2022 have essentially replaced the revenues from News America Marketing, providing a much stronger base for long-term growth. The company has changed and evolved since 2013 and is well positioned for future success. We have maintained a very healthy balance sheet while we strengthened the asset base, transform digitally generated healthy free cash flow and continue to improve our operating efficiencies. Turning to our financials. I will focus on the fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down 9% year-over-year, which was heavily impacted by the $110 million or 4% negative impact related to the extra week last year and the $72 million or 3% impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Impressively, total segment EBITDA was $341 million, up 8% year-over-year despite very difficult year-over-year comparisons and weak trading conditions at HarperCollins. Margins improved by over 2 percentage points to 14%. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues declined 7% compared to the prior year, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 2% versus the prior year. Both revenues and total segment EBITDA were also negatively impacted by the extra week last year. Adjusted revenue and total segment EBITDA did not exclude that impact. Earnings per share in the quarter were a loss of $0.01 compared to income of $0.19 in the prior year. The current quarter reflects $85 million of restructuring and impairment charges, mostly related to our company-wide headcount reduction that we communicated on the last earnings call and an $81 million noncash write-down in equity losses of affiliates related to REA's investment in Property Guru. The prior year income of $0.19 benefited from $149 million tax benefit. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.14 in the quarter compared to $0.37 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $369 million, down 17% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic pressures, a negative impact of $15 million or 4% from foreign currency fluctuations, and $14 million or 3% of negative impact from the extra week last year. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues decreased 14%. Segment EBITDA declined 11% to $108 million, impacted by lower revenues, partially offset by the lower discretionary costs, compensation and broker commissions. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 5%. REA revenues were $223 million, which declined 11% on a reported basis or down 5% on a constant currency basis. The revenue decline was due to the impact of lower national listings and a decrease in financial services revenue driven by lower settlement activity. New buy listings for the fourth quarter were down 18% year-over-year with the higher-yielding metro areas of Sydney and Melbourne showing improvement each month of the quarter, yet ended down 17% and 16%, respectively. Those declines were partially offset by the annual price increases in the residential and commercial businesses increased uptake in premium products, including Premier Plus, favorable death penetration and continued strong performance from REA India, which maintained its audience leadership. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. At Move, revenues were $146 million, down 24% compared to the prior year, which reflects the $14 million or 7% negative impact related to the absence of the extra week. Excluding the extra week impact, revenue declined 17%, similar to the third quarter results with yield optimization in the lead generation products, partially offsetting lower lead and transaction volume. Lead volumes moderated to down 14% year-over-year compared to a decline of 30% in the third quarter while Realtor's average monthly unique users declined 20% from the prior year to $74 million in the fourth quarter based on internal metrics yet up from $72 million in the third quarter. We remain focused on driving both usage and Engagement through continued product enhancements And improvements to SEO while expanding our core adjacencies of seller, rentals and new homes.Turning to the switch and Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 4% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year, the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 23% in the prior year. OTT revenue growth again more than offset broadcast revenue declines, benefiting from both increased subscribers and price increases at Kayo and BINGE. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group improved to over $4.6 million at quarter end, up 5% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers approached $3.1 million, increasing 14% versus the prior year and accounted for approximately 66% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Binge continued to expand advertising inventory on the basic product generating both modest incremental revenues and some upgrade activity to the higher tiered subscription offerings. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down only 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down more than 260 basis points year-over-year to 11.1%, the lowest level since fiscal 2016, while broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over AUD 84 Foxtel announced a price rise beginning in July across some of the broadcast tiers, the first since fiscal 2019, which will benefit the fiscal 2024 results. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $78 million was down 4% versus the prior year, but was up 4% on an adjusted basis despite higher programming costs, mostly related to contractual escalators across key sports rights. On the product front, following the successful growth in streaming, the business will be launching a streaming aggregation device leveraging the Sky glass technology. Expectation is for a commercial launch later in fiscal 2024 and we will keep you updated on our progress. Moving to Dow Jones, Dow Jones had another strong quarter with revenues of $546 million, down 3%, which includes the negative impact of $40 million or 7% related to the absence of the extra week from last year. We lapped the Opus acquisition in March and CMA in June. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 3 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represent over 79% of total revenues, up over 2 percentage points from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6% but would have delivered a modest improvement, excluding the extra week. We are continuing to see strong momentum in our professional information business with revenues rising 10% year-over-year, benefiting from the continued integration of Opus and CMA coupled with strong revenues from risk and compliance. Results were partly offset by the extra week last year, which led to a $14 million or 8% negative impact on the performance. Excluding the extra week, PIB revenues grew 18%. PIB revenues this quarter accounted for 37% of segment revenues. And while we don't disclose specific margins, PIB margins are higher than the overall Dow Jones margin and are contributing strongly to segment EBITDA. Underscoring the uniqueness and durability of the Dow Jones asset mix. Risk &amp; Compliance revenues rose 10% despite the extra week in the prior year and continued to grow at a high teens rate on a like-for-like basis. While 60% of the customers are in the financial services sector, the fastest growth is now coming from corporates with demand driven by the anti-money laundering financial corruption and ESG screening and monitoring products. Retention remains over 90%. Opus and CMA's revenue performance remained robust, benefiting from price escalators, new products and new customers. Retention rates for Opus and CMA subscription products remain in the mid-90s, which is underpinning the transformation of Dow Jones revenue base. Circulation revenues declined 6% due to the absence of the extra week lower print volume and weakness at IBD, as we noted in the third quarter. Excluding the extra week impact of $17 million or 7%, circulation revenues were up 1% year-over-year, which is slightly higher than the third quarter rate. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions grew 12% year-over-year or by $163,000 sequentially, with the year-over-year rate improving from last quarter. Advertising revenues declined 14% to $100 million and accounted for 18% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, with digital down 10% and print down 18%. Excluding the negative impact from the absence of the extra week of $9 million or 8%, the decline rate moderated from the third quarter to down 6%. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 25% to $133 million as cost growth moderated from the first half. Margins improved to 24%, up from 19% last year. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter increased 17%, a notable improvement over the third quarter and the full year performance. At Book Publishing, both HarperCollins and the industry more broadly faced challenging headwinds in the quarter, revenues fell 13% to $446 million, which included approximately $20 million or 4% of negative impact from the absence of the extra week. Consumer demand slowed in the fourth quarter more than we initially expected, leading to lower frontlist sales and higher returns, particularly in Christian Publishing and General books. Most of the weakness was in North America. Segment EBITDA declined 66% year-over-year to $16 million, a 4% segment EBITDA margin. Segment EBITDA was impacted by the weak top line performance as well as higher-than-normal levels of royalty write-offs due to the underperformance of certain titles further compressing profit margins. Despite some unusual headwinds, we are seeing moderation in freight and manufacturing costs, while headcount reduction initiatives are expected to exceed the 5% target. The backlist represented 59% of revenues for the quarter, up 3 points from last year but down slightly from Q3. Digital sales declined 10% this quarter, mostly driven by lower e-book sales and accounted for 25% of consumer sales, up from 24% last year. On an adjusted basis, revenues fell 13% and segment EBITDA fell 17%. Turning to News Media. Revenues were $571 million, down 9%, primarily due to the absence of the extra week, which negatively impacted revenues by $36 million or 6% and the impact from foreign currency of $18 million or 3%. Adjusted revenues declined 7%. And Advertising declined around 15%, reflecting a $15 million or 6% negative impact related to the absence of the extra week and a $6 million or 2% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact from the extra week in currency, advertising revenues declined approximately 7% due to weaknesses at News Australia, which was impacted by last year's federal election and some softness in real estate and retail. News U.K. and New York Post were relatively stable versus the prior year. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 7% due to the absence of the extra week negatively impacting revenues by $19 million or 6% and at a $9 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Excluding the extra week and currency impact, circulation and subscription revenues rose 2% and with growth driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and double-digit subscriber growth across News Australia and, The Times, and The Sunday Times. Segment EBITDA of $45 million rose 36% due to a 12% decline in cost driven by ongoing cost saving initiatives and lower costs related to Talk TV and other digital investments. Adjustment segment EBITDA rose 42%. Turning to the outlook. Market trends remain mixed geographically. That said, we have taken aggressive action over the years to improve our asset base including a shift to more recurring and digital revenues, coupled with strong cost initiatives and focused reinvestment in our core pillars. We still expect some inflationary pressures, but are hopeful that they will be at a more modest rate. We exited the fiscal fourth quarter with a return to total segment EBITDA growth, and we hope to see improvements in fiscal 2024. Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for July declined 5%. REA should benefit from double-digit residential yield growth as price increases have been successfully implemented. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, while we anticipate improvements in lead volume and transactions across the full year, they will likely remain challenging in the short term. We also expect higher marketing spend compared to the fourth quarter, together with ongoing investment in adjacencies, which we will balance with cost reductions. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn as we complete the migration of customers from cable in the first half. We expect modestly higher expenses for the full year driven by sports rights and product investment, which will be more weighted to the first half. We expect full year CapEx and profitability will be relatively stable in local currency. At Dow Jones, we hope to see improvement in advertising declines, but as is typical, visibility is limited. We also expect to see continued strong growth from PIB. We expect modestly higher overall expenses in the first quarter and for the full year in contrast to the fourth quarter. In Book Publishing, HarperCollins in the industry exhibited more volatility last year than normal. That said, July was encouraging, with a return to revenue growth, EBITDA margins lifting from the fourth quarter lows, and prior year comparisons are easing. At News Media, July advertising trends remain mixed geographically. We expect Talk TV costs will be similar, if not lower than the prior year in local currency. We have also seen moderating newsprint cost pressures in the U.K. We expect CapEx in fiscal 2024 to be moderately higher than in fiscal 2023, primarily due to digital reinvestment. That being said, our CapEx came in notably lower than we expected this fiscal year, and we will be monitoring it closely with respect to macro and business conditions as we did during the current year. We expect to generate strong cash flows and expect to return a high percentage of shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.David KarnovskyMaybe Susan, just on the cost initiatives. I don't know if there's a way you could frame how much of that was a contributor in the quarter. And then I think last earnings, you stated you thought the majority of the benefit would come through in the fiscal first quarter. Is that still the case? And then just on other segment EBITDA that was better sequentially. Is that from the cost savings and should we think about that line as sustainable?Susan Lee PanuccioThanks, David. Look, I think we did have a really good quarter in Q4 in relation to the cost savings, and that certainly helped some of the segments, particularly News Media. You can see that coming through in the results. And yes, I did say last quarter that we would expect to see the full benefit coming through into fiscal 2024. I think that still is the case as we sit here today. We do expect to exceed that $160 million of gross cost savings from the 5% headcount reduction.But I would note, as we go into 2024, we will have some inflationary pressures related to wages, newsprint prices and manufacturing costs, and we will continue with our digital reinvestment initiatives across the various businesses. So that number quoted was gross cost savings, and that will help offset those increases in investments. Just in relation to the other segment, there are a couple of things going on. We had the NAM settlement, the legal fees in the quarter last year. So we got the benefit of that in this quarter. We also had lower bonus accruals coming through in this year than what we did relative to the prior year. I think if you want to think about the next year, I'd probably have a look at the Q3 rate as sort of an indicative performance for going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital.Alan Steven GouldRobert, I've got 2 actually. On the generative AI, can you give us an indication of this consortium? Are you in a consortium, what the process is? Is there any legislative movement? And secondly, can you give some discussion on Simon &amp; Schuster. I realize that they have one offer that could be very productive, but it does seem like the multiple was quite expensive.Robert J. ThomsonYes, Alan. Look, first of all, on AI, you're right by instinct that this is an important moment in the history of news and knowledge with commercial and social implications and a profound impact on creativity and integrity. If fake news and deep fakes are a concern, the potential for sophisticated forgeries for counterfed content is almost endless. And separately, generative AI has the potential to recycle itself in what you might call, endless perfidious permutations. And that's why the provenance of the archival base is so crucial and why refreshing daily weekly with incremental improvements is imperative. So the potential is enormous, but garbage in, garbage out and garbage all about. We've invested billions of dollars in knowledge creation, actually tens of billions of dollars. And that content certainly has a value in this editorial epoch. For almost 2 decades, we've genuinely led the digital debate about Providence, which is echoed in Washington and London, Brussels and Canberra and Tokyo and Rome. For us, what gives me confidence for our company and our community, is that the leaders of the largest digital companies are clearly sincerely focused on the issue. They understand our collective responsibility, and we are actively individually engaged in fruitful discussions. I can't be more specific at this moment. but we see a positive financial result through consensual negotiation, not through litigation. We would like to reward journalists, not lawyers. As for Simon &amp; Schuster, normally, we don't speculate on speculation about M&amp;A. But candidly, as you intimate, we wouldn't be prepared to go that high, given that, in our case, you could reasonably expect 18 months of scrupulous scrutiny by the antitrust authorities with all the related legal costs and the financial opportunity cost. We obviously have great respect for the company and resources. But given the regulatory risk, we were quietly hoping that, frankly, Simon &amp; Schuster would be remanded and that we would get the company for a bargain. But it obviously didn't end up in the Barnes &amp; Noble bargain Ben.OperatorOur next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.Kane HannanJust on Foxtel, should we still think about the 5 million subs, $3 billion revenue target you guys set out for next year, I think back at the Investor Day? And just given those CapEx comments, I mean do we still think it will eventually come down to that 4% target or something changed there?Robert J. ThomsonWell, Kane, we're certainly aiming high when it comes to Foxtel. And you can see from the success that we've had in streaming. Our total streaming subs rose 14% to $3.1 million, and our streaming revenues rose 26%. So that's also a healthy growth in ARPU. At the same time, our broadcast churn fell sharply and was 11.1% in the quarter compared to 13.8% in the prior year, while broadcast ARPU rose 2%. So, where else in the world are you actually witnessing a decline in the broadcast churn rate while experiencing a continuing surge in streaming? That really is the Foxtel success story.Susan Lee PanuccioAnd Kane, just in relation to the CapEx. Yes, we still think that's a relevant target over time. As I've mentioned in my comments, we expect CapEx to be relatively stable in the coming year because we've got the reinvestment in relation to the aggregation service that we're about to launch.OperatorOur next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evanson Partners.Entcho RaykovskiRobert. Susan. My question is around the Foxtel shareholder loan. Obviously, you flagged the intention for it to be repaid. Just interested, once that's repaid, do you expect any recourse to News Corp from lenders? In other words, will you have to guarantee any of the Foxtel refi? And I guess as part of answering that question, is there anything in particular which has driven the ability of Foxtel to refinance, particularly if you're not guaranteeing the loan. And sorry, I will just extend it a little bit further. Should we read this into a preparation for a potential spin out of Foxtel down the track? Obviously, that's been speculated for a little while.Susan Lee PanuccioEntcho , maybe I'll take the first couple. So no, we don't have a guarantee on there. And no, we don't that there will be anything to do with the guarantee going forward in relation to the refi. Actually, the reason that we could refi it so successfully is really because of the underlying business performance of Foxtel. They've had a great couple of years and really reinvented themselves. And it's a real credit to the team down there that they've got themselves into this position. So that's really what's driving the strong refi outcome. And maybe I'll hand over to Robert to comment on the IPO.Robert J. ThomsonYes. Entcho, obviously we can't comment specifically about an IPO. But what I can say with absolute certainty is that the success we've had with Foxtel has given us absolutely the option of optionality.OperatorOur next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.Craig Anthony HuberBook Publishing, obviously, the margins and the profit dollars there were much lower than I think most people expect it, certainly me, but also they are much lower than pre-COVID and stuff. Is there any reason to think this environment that this revenue performance and the margins won't continue for at least a few more quarters?Robert J. ThomsonCraig, look, obviously, the 53rd week comparison exaggerates the decline, but the inflationary pressures are beginning to abate and some of the costs around royalty write-offs were relatively unique. So the team at HarperCollins have obviously been taking a remedial action to improve our fortunes for this fiscal. We've implemented a price rise across various categories. And actually, the team is particularly confident about the impact of our current releases.And it's safe to say that our expectation, our firm expectation is that there will be significant margin improvement this year. This very week. We have Three of the top 10 fiction bestsellers in the U.S. with the #1 seller Ann Patchett's Tom Lake, which has already sold more than 100,000 copies across print and digital in the first week on sale. As well in that top 10, we have Demon Copperhead from Barbara Kingsolver and The Collector by Daniel Silva. Now that success in the top 10 will be reflected in the bottom line.OperatorOur next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.Lucy HuangI just have one question on Professional Information Services. Are you able to talk through kind of what drove the growth over the fourth quarter. What's the contribution from subscriber growth versus price growth in that business? And I guess maybe if you can talk through some of your margin expectations coming into the fourth quarter. Is there expected to be more incremental investment in this space? Or could we see margins continue to expand into next year?Robert J. ThomsonWell, Lucy, safe to say we're delighted with the progress in the Dow Jones B2B business. You can see the impact on our margin more broadly at Dow Jones and longer term, you'll see it at News Corporation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the EBITDA margin at Dow Jones was adding 0.8% in the last quarter, it was 24.4%, and the overall margin at News Corp rose from 11.8% to 14%, and in a year where we were presented with real macro challenges. Net margin increase is, of course, a measure of growing profitability, but it's also a measure of our robustness. So quarter after quarter, year after year, we've seen double-digit growth increases at Risk &amp; Compliance. We now expect the same for Opus and CMA and we're frankly, delighted with the speed of integration of both Opus and CMA and ensuing quarters, will see the benefits of that.OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.Brian HanOn the Wall Street Journal, can you please provide some color on digital subscription pricing in terms of how much it rose in the June quarter and what the outlook may be for '24?Robert J. ThomsonBrian, difficult to be too specific. What you're seeing in the circulation patterns at Dow Jones is partly a matter of phasing and a modest decline in print subscriptions. The emphasis is on the digital bundle with the combination of Mark Wash Barns and The Wall Street Journal. And sometimes in the shorter term, that means the average price of age is a little lower, but we are building loyalty and reducing churn in each of the products and in the long term, increasing the price elasticity. I mean, the biggest problem for any Richemont business, apart from acquisition itself is churn.OperatorOur next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.Darren LeungJust a quick one on Move, please. It looks like the revenues declined 24 -- odd % but listing is obviously only down 20%. So I just wanted a bit of clarity in terms of this seems to be the first period where we've actually seen revenue growth declined more than volume growth. So I just wanted a bit of clarity at what's happening to the yield and other products base, that's usually been a bit of an offset for the business, please?Robert J. ThomsonObviously, the housing market slowdown in the U.S. is having a profound impact on all digital property companies. And that is being reflected to a certain extent at REALTOR but I have to say the company is core to News corporation, it's complementary to other assets. And you're going to see that irrefutable fact in coming months with the impact of Damian Eales, who knows our company intimately. And what you will see with a lot of digital property companies is the cost of marketing. And we're remaking our marketing and have strong plans for leveraging our platforms. And look, we're talking about enormously influential digital platforms. It helps the Wall Street Journal, by the way, to have exposure in Florida via Realtor. And it helps Realtor to have the Florida audience in the New York Post, which is in the many, many millions. As I mentioned, the post has about 145 million monthly uniques. We have about 80 million at Dow Jones. And in the U.S. alone, about $110 million at the Sun depending on the month. And so in building both listings and yield, we're going to be obsessively focused on leveraging that comparative advantage.Susan Lee PanuccioAnd Darren, there's a little bit of noise in the numbers because of week 53. If you exclude the week 53 impact, it was actually down 17%, which was consistent with what it was down last quarter.Robert J. ThomsonAnd I would just make one further observation about the Australian property market, as Susan alluded to earlier. I would say that we are seeing some particularly positive signs in Australian housing market, which will surely benefit REA and us. There's no doubt that activity has already picked up this quarter, and that should be reflected in our results. It's a very transparent market. Anyone can track listings and the auction completion rate. So I would encourage investors to do the math in coming weeks. Sometimes we've forgotten that thanks to Lachlan Murdoch, REA is an integral part of News Corporation, and it has a market cap today of around AUD 21 billion.OperatorNext question will be a follow-up from Craig Huber from Huber Research .Craig Anthony HuberI appreciate the much better results in this quarter and you guys have had some really good results you know ever since COVID happened in particular. But it comes up all the time with investors, why is this company News Corp so complicated? And is there any potential movement here to to simplify the company going forward? I guess, I'd love to have updated thoughts on that with what you can tell us.Robert J. ThomsonLook, we are constantly reviewing our structure to ensure the optimal use of resources and the best outcomes for investors. That's why we were prepared to contemplate a sale of REALTOR for rather generous price. And why we've done much underlying structural and regulatory work that gives us more flexibility in our collective decision-making. So we're conscious, acutely conscious of our responsibilities to investors, but also acutely aware of the value of our assets. And we've been building a portfolio for a reason. You can see, since our split, annual print-related revenues have decreased almost $3.2 billion. That is correct, $3.2 billion. And we've more than replaced that number with digital growth and made the company far more profitable with far greater free cashflow. So we know that we do need to provide more transparency so that the value and the potential of our assets are better understood as you made clear. That's why we broke out Dow Jones. And you can see the rapidly increasing revenues, particularly in the professional information business, which was the largest contributor to profitability this year. And that has already been noticed by investors.OperatorAt this time, we have no further questions. So I'll hand over to Michael Florin for closing remarks.Michael FlorinGreat. Well, thank you, Leila, and thank you all very much for participating. Have a wonderful day, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care.]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Patterson Cos. (PDCO) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.42 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on September 7, 2023.PDCO has an Earnings ESP figure of 5.66%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.42 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.40.PDCO is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Align Technology (ALGN) as well.Slated to report earnings on October 25, 2023, Align Technology holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.28 a share 75 days from its next quarterly update.Align Technology's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.35% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.25.Story continuesPDCO and ALGN's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The outperformance reflects strong domestic oil and gas production.However, the company’s bottom line fell from the year-ago adjusted profit of $1.32 due to weaker oil realizations and higher production costs in the United States.The company reported revenues of $1.5 billion, which came 0.4% above the consensus mark but fell 34.3% from the year-ago sales of $2.3 billion.Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote Segmental PerformanceThis Texas-based energy explorer’s total net production (from U.S. and International units) in the quarter under review came in at 399,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared to 343,000 BOE/d in the year-ago period.U.S. E&amp;P: This U.S. upstream unit reported an income of $365 million, down from $846 million in the year-ago period due to lower oil realizations and higher costs, partly offset by stronger production. We modeled the segment income at $378.9 million.Marathon Oil’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $72.49 per barrel were significantly lower than the year-earlier level of $110.10 and marginally missed our projection of $72.72. Additionally, natural gas liquids’ average price realizations decreased 53.6% to $18.72 a barrel. Finally, average realized natural gas prices plunged 72.4% year over year to $1.89 per thousand cubic feet though it managed to beat our estimate of $1.79.Meanwhile, production costs were $5.88 per BOE, representing a 1.4% year-over-year rise.Net production of 356,000 BOE/d was up 25.8% from second-quarter 2022. Total U.S. output, which came ahead of our projection of 346 BOE/d, comprised approximately 51% oil, or 181,000 barrels per day (bpd).Significantly higher year-over-year production from Eagle Ford favorably affected the company’s quarterly performance, which was partly offset by lower volumes from the Bakken and Oklahoma areas. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 156,000 BOE/d, surging 85.7% from the level in second-quarter 2022, while output from Bakken was 109,000 BOE/d compared with 114,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma output came in at 50,000 BOE/d, down from the year-ago level of 56,000 BOE/d.International E&amp;P: The segment, which explores and produces oil and gas in Equatorial Guinea, reported earnings of $30 million compared with $160 million in the year-ago period and our projection of $89.2 million. These results could be primarily blamed on lower output.Marathon reported production available for sale of 43,000 BOE/d, down from 60,000 Boe/d in second-quarter 2022 and below our expectation of 49 BOE/d.Marathon’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $53.64 per barrel reflected a 32.7% deterioration from the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas and natural gas liquids’ average price realizations came in at 24 cents per thousand cubic feet and $1 a barrel, respectively, the same as the corresponding period of 2022.Story continues Financial PositionTotal costs in the quarter were $1.1 billion, $50 million higher than the prior-year period and marginally above our expectations. Marathon Oil reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for the second quarter, down 29.3% from a year ago.As of Jun 30, 2023, it had cash and cash equivalents worth $215 million and long-term debt of 5.7 billion.

52,d64fa082-66ab-38be-a2c8-051ec69094c8,MSFT,2023-08-12,20 Countries With Highest Rate of Economic Growth in 5 Years,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-highest-rate-economic-121800158.html,1691842680,STORY,"['XOM', 'AAPL', 'MSFT']","[In this article, we look at 20 countries with the highest rate of economic growth in 5 years. You can skip our detailed analysis on the global economic dynamics, and head over directly to the 5 Countries With Highest Rate of Economic Growth in 5 Years.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the market value of all goods and services produced in a country within a given time period. It is a widely accepted metric to gauge the health and size of a nation’s economy. According to the OECD, the global GDP growth dropped from 3.3% in 2022 to 2.7% in 2023, but is expected to rebound and pick up to reach 2.9% in 2024. This is being driven by declining energy prices, improving consumer sentiment, and the reopening of China after Beijing eased Covid-19 restrictions.One of our recent articles, the 20 Largest Economies in the World by 2050, covered the projected rise of several Asian, African, and Latin American economies, and talked about how the Emerging 7, or E7 markets, will surpass the advanced economies in the coming decades. The 21st century has been dubbed by economic experts to be Asia’s century with countries such as China, India, and Indonesia continuing to take big strides. However, we often overlook the silent economic rise of the African continent and some of the lesser known island nations in the Caribbean and Oceania.Guyana has been the fastest growing economy in the world in terms of real GDP since 2018, recording an average economic growth of 27.14% in the last five years – including 62.3% in 2023 according to the IMF. Located on South America’s North Atlantic Coast, Guyana was one of the poorest countries in the region until 2015 when Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) discovered major oil deposits some 100 miles off Guyana. The oil deposits are expected to generate $10 billion per annum for the country, with that figure expected to rise to $157 billion by 2040. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and its partners earned $5.8 billion last year from oil production in Guyana. In April this year, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced plans to invest in a $12.7 billion oil project – their fifth in the country.Story continuesOn the other hand, nine of the 20 countries with the highest rate of economic growth in the last five years are African economies. Africa is the second fastest growing region in the world after Asia. Despite facing challenges such as the pandemic, followed by disruption of global supply chains in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the African region remains resilient and had a real GDP growth of 3.8% in 2022, according to the African Development Bank. Economic growth is expected to rise to 4.1% in 2023-24.The continent is known for having vast mineral resources, because of which is it is home to some of the largest mining companies in the world, including some that are even listed on stock exchanges of the United States, such as AngloGold Ashanti Limited (NYSE:AU), Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI), and Sasol Limited (NYSE:SSL). You can read more on this in our article, the 30 Biggest Economies in Africa.Asia continues to remain a powerhouse, due to its large population and subsequently a large market size. A number of western corporations have shifted part of their operations to Asian economies to take advantage of cheap skilled and unskilled labour. One such example is that of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). 95% of its iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices are made in China. The country was also the source of nearly one-fifth of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s revenue in 2022. The company is also making inroads in India, where earlier this year, Tim Cook inaugurated Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s first retail store in India in Mumbai.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also been increasing its footprint in Asia. The company announced in 2021 about its plan to set up a data center in Indonesia, which is likely to boost its annual revenue by $6 billion. In the United Arab Emirates, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects its cloud services portfolio to add $39 billion to the Emirati economy.Homegrown Asian companies themselves contribute $19 trillion to the global economy. One among them is Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), an e-commerce giant that holds the dominant share in China’s wholesale and retail markets. Japanese car manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) holds an 11.5% share in the world’s automobile industry, while the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited accounts of 60% of the global output in the foundry industry. Moreover, the Reliance Industries Limited in India recently outranked companies like BMW, Nestle, Sony, and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in Forbes’ Global 2000 list of the world’s largest companies.MethodologyWe have ranked the 20 countries with the highest rate of economic growth in 5 years, using real GDP growth rates between 2018 and 2022. The data was sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip stocks, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Out of these, a mere handful manages to catch public attention due to a variety of factors. These firms can either be popular household names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), firms that have created new industries like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or companies that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and are known for their financial stability and strength.Firms at the top of the stock market food chain are often referred to as Blue Chip stocks. The term 'Blue Chip' is more than a century old, and as you might have guessed, it comes from poker where players assign a monetary value to chips and then gamble on them with cards. A blue chip stock in the 1920s would typically have a share price greater than $200 and the term was coined by a reporter for Dow Jones. These days, there are no fixed criteria to define a firm as a blue chip, however, the typical classification normally includes the 30 stocks included in the Dow 30 index.Investing in blue chip stocks typically offers a variety of benefits that one might be unable to accrue when investing in other stocks such as penny stocks or small cap stocks. These firms are typically quite resilient to significant share price drops due to their size and stability, and their popularity also provides the market with plenty of liquidity. Not to mention, several blue chip stocks also pay dividends. We took a closer look at blue chip firms with large market capitalization and stable dividend growth as part of our 12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy coverage and determined that the top dividend paying stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesAugust is an important month for the stock market as it will see several large firms report their earnings for the second quarter of 2023. These earnings come at a time when high interest rates take their toll on corporate spending, but lowering inflation provides consumers with more leeway to make expensive purchases. To add to this, the earnings also provide important hints about the current state of the U.S. economy, to enable analysts and economists to determine whether a recession might materialize just when everybody starts looking the other way.One blue chip stock that reported its earnings in August is Apple. The largest technology company in the world saw its quarterly revenue drop for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the revenue for the first three quarters also fell. However, Apple still beat analyst EPS estimates due to lower costs in administrative and other expenses. Another blue chip firm and one whose sales are closely watched to measure consumer spending power is Coca-Cola. It is the largest beverage company in the world and one that had a strong second quarter as it managed to beat analyst EPS estimates by a wide margin. Coca-Cola reported $12 billion in net revenues for the quarter, which marked a 6% annual growth. The results indicated that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation, and the revenue growth also enabled Coca-Cola to report a 34% GAAP EPS growth.However, for the beverages company, the biggest takeaway from its second quarter of 2023 earnings was not the revenue or the EPS figures. Instead, it was Coca-Cola's guidance, as the company upgraded its non-GAAP revenue guidance to predict an 8% to 9% organic growth for the full year 2023. Corporate guidance is a crucial factor in an earnings season like the one we're currently in the middle of. This is because firms have a real time view of their operations which leaves them in a better position to predict future outcomes. These outcomes, when put together, can also provide the tea leaves to make a prediction of the broader economic performance.Joining Coca-Cola as an important company whose earnings guidance and financial performance are also an economic barometer is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The retailer has direct contact with consumers due to its business model, and while it has not reported its latest earnings, investment bank Credit Suisse has some good news for the stock as it has increased Walmart's share price target to $180 from $170. Credit Suisse believes that Walmart is positioned well to handle any volatility in consumer spending as its entire approach is based on providing customers with value.With this context, let's take a look at the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to Wall Street. The stocks leading the pack are The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street AnalystsNorthfoto / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to analysts, we calculated the share price upside for blue chip companies based on their average share price target data from Yahoo Finance.

Our second quarter results demonstrate the demand for our platform and the strength of our business model. Amidst the ongoing uncertainty in the macro environment, we continue to see customers depend on AvePoint's confidence platform to rapidly reduce costs, improve productivity and make more informed business decisions as they advance their digital workplaces. This demand, coupled with our sustained focus on profitable growth, drove another quarter that surpassed expectations on both the top and bottom line. Jim will dive into our financial results shortly, but first, I want to discuss 2 main topics.First, generative AI, and how we're positioning AvePoint for continued long-term success amidst the massive and dynamic changes that are happening in our platform environment; and second, the journey of AvePoint's customers where our abilities to partner with them in every stage of their digital workplace transformation and cloud optimization journey remains a key competitive advantage for AvePoint and led to another strong set of results this quarter. Let's start with generative AI. We're excited about the potential AI to disrupt industries and drive innovation and as the earliest Microsoft SaaS cloud partner and today the most mature B2B SaaS data management vendor, AvePoint is well positioned to lead the way. In conversations I've had with our customers, our partners and my peers, 2 things are abundantly clear.First, the bedrock for impactful AI solutions is data, especially the powerful combination of proprietary data gathered from unique sources on top of foundational AI models, which together will pave the way for unprecedented commercial success and customer satisfaction. And second, the only way to create a successful AI strategy to unlock business value is by applying an advanced information management strategy to the organization's proprietary data. This is where the AvePoint confidence platform comes in. AvePoint has been working with customers for over 2 decades to modernize, control and apply resilience to their data management practices. And over the last several years, we have incorporated machine learning and AI into our platform, establishing the foundation for powerful insights, impactful recommendations and comprehensive protection of our customers' digital workplace investments.Our innovation has already helped customers achieve business value by swiftly detecting and guarding against ransomware attacks, ensuring policy enforcement for how information is accessed and improving the life cycle of the information through strong data governance. Today, we manage more than 250 petabytes of data for our customers on a daily basis, which gives us unparalleled insight into how data is used in different context. Now we have opportunity to go further in helping organizations extract value from their data. A great example of this is a private preview program we launched for our cloud record solution last quarter with 4 Australian government organizations, offering AI power capabilities that transform how organizations costed by content efficiently, accurately and at scale.One of the participants completed a migration of their data sets from a legacy platform to the cloud, but was unable to correctly classify much of the content due to resource constraints. Our automated intelligence model, which can rapidly identify and classify various type of content apply the appropriate business rules and life cycle to ensure business and legislative compliance. While completing this manually would have taken the organization years, our model [indiscernible] is so in weeks, yielding a factor of nearly 20x productivity improvement. This provided the government agency with better information at lower cost, which in turn will be used for more rapid and accurate reporting and decision-making. Our track record of innovation, combined with our unique features and platform capabilities, establishes our ability to continue releasing more AI-driven solutions that democratize insights, recommendations and protection for our customers and our build up on robust data management strategy.software, tehnology, laptopPhoto by Danial Igdery on UnsplashYou'll hear more from us in the months to come of our continued AI innovation, especially at our upcoming industry Shifthappens Conference in October. Turning now to the customer journey. This innovation aligns with how we see our customers continuing to evolve their digital workplaces and how our platform supports every stage of their transformation. This often means initially solving one problem and then leveraging our other platform solutions to address their additional needs. Before I share examples of this in action during the second quarter, let me remind you of the components of our platform, which supports every stage of organization's digital workplace transformation, including cloud consumption optimization use cases to help organization maximize their ROI on cloud.The AvePoint confidence platform consists of the control suite which delivers a sustainable ready-made framework for automated governance and policy enforcement, protecting business-critical information across collaborative workspaces, their resilience suite, which enables organizations to efficiently comply with data protection regulations and preserve critical records, ensuring business continuity and compliance and the modernization suite, which transforms legacy data and business processes for use by modern SaaS platforms, driving digital workplace transformation and enhancing the employee experience across the organization. Moving on to the examples. Starting with expansion from a modernization suite to the resilient suite. A global analytic company, headquartered in U.K., initially came to us to perform a migration to Microsoft 365, leveraging our data analytics capability to reduce the data estate to be moved into the cloud, while maintaining the fidelity of the information during the move.Our success here was just the beginning of the partnership as our Chief Information Officer was also concerned about protecting its Microsoft 365, Azure Active Directory, now known as Microsoft Entra ID and Azure storage environments. Our seamless migration engagement bolstered by our platform play to address the entirety of the data protection needs led to a competitive win with our resilient suite in Q2, ensuring it can secure its digital workplace for its 15,000 users. Second, an expansion from the control suite to the modernization suite. A Fortune 100 multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in the U.S. with more than 100,000 employees had deployed Microsoft 365 and needed additional capabilities for holistic data governance strategy.They originally leveraged our cloud governance product to operate their environment more effectively. They needed to understand how their content was being shared internally and that only the right people have the proper access in accordance with their rigorous security requirements. Once we demonstrate our ability to meet these needs, they added our tyGraph product in Q2, leveraging our platform's data orchestration engine with AI sentiment analysis model to assess the usage of their Microsoft 365 investments and gain better insights into employee engagement. And importantly, their journey with us will continue as we're in talks to extend our governance capabilities to improve their use of homegrown business workflows as well as our cloud records product in the resilient suite to drive a more comprehensive approach to information management.Third, expansion from the resilience suite to the control suite, a large Hawaii-based financial institution was concerned about data loss and ransomware tax and originally choose our resilience suite for data protection and frequent backups that were easy to use and met privacy statutes, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. Just 2 months later, they added our policies and Insight product from our control suite, empowering them to manage their digital workplace, trigger automated alerts that identify critical issues and enforce policies, mandates, which have never been more important for global financial service institutions. And we're already in discussions with them to expand their resilience suite deployment with our products specific to Microsoft Power Platform and Azure as they broaden their digital workplace adoption.As you can see from these examples, the AvePoint confidence platform offers a unique value proposition to companies of any size, in any industry located anywhere in the world regardless where they are in their digital transformation journey. We empower companies to optimize and secure the solutions that most commonly establish and underpin their digital workplace today. And going forward, we believe that the more automation will lead to even greater customer collaboration and efficiency. Our Q2 results made clear that our strategy is resonating both with the customers and with our partners who are critical to our long-term success and with whom we continue to do incredible work. Before I turn the call to Jim, I want to recognize the team for another strong quarter in signing new logos, which are the foundation of our future growth.One of the largest food and beverage companies in the world became AvePoint customer in Q2, purchasing our cloud governance and policy insights product to amplify the benefits of their data sources. The organization was looking to ensure the use of their data sets were safe, responsible and effective with our products they will now be able to process volumes of information by making sure the data is appropriately shared, accessible, interoperable and reusable. In other words, making information actionable. Our ability to generate proactive insights will allow their security team to understand the information's context and make sure their governance policies align to their regulatory requirements. In addition to taking more proactive posture, there is a clear cost benefit with reduced time spent on investigating data breach events.Our products provide the single pane of glass to monitor and analyze their data usage so they can protect their data and information from fraud and bad actors to safeguard their reputation and revenue. For more than 2 decades, AvePoint has pushed the boundaries of digital workplace transformation by innovating to meet the needs of our customers, especially as they navigate dynamic macroeconomic environments. As I hope my remarks today have made clear we're well positioned for continued success, and we're equally ready to maximize the massive opportunity ahead of us to unlock the value of generative AI to increase efficiency, boost productivity and drive critical innovation. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to discuss our financial results in more detail.James Caci: Thank you, TJ, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us as we review our strong second quarter results. And let me remind you that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to non-GAAP metrics. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2023, total revenues were $64.9 million, up 16% year-over-year and once again above the high end of our guidance. Within total revenues, second quarter SaaS revenue was $38.3 million, up 39% year-over-year. And in Q2, SaaS comprised 59% of total revenues compared to 50% a year ago. Looking at the business geographically, we saw solid performance across all regions, once again driven by year-over-year growth in our SaaS business. In North America, on a constant currency basis, SaaS revenues grew 35% while total revenue grew 16%.In EMEA, on a constant currency basis, SaaS revenues grew 41%, while total revenues grew 10%. And in APAC, on a constant currency basis, SaaS revenues grew 46%, while total revenues grew 28%. As of June 30, 2023, total ARR was $236.2 million, representing year-over-year growth of 26% and growth of 30% when adjusted for the impact of FX. We ended the second quarter with 495 customers with ARR of over $100,000, up 19% from the prior year period. As of the end of Q2, 49% of our total ARR came through the channel compared to 46% a year ago and 48% at the end of Q1. And for Q2 specifically, 61% of our incremental ARR came through the channel compared to 56% for Q1. While this percentage may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we expect the overall channel contribution to continue increasing, in turn, driving ARR growth and operating efficiencies.Turning now to our retention rates, which, as you know, are a primary area of focus for us and critical to our long-term growth strategies. Adjusted for the impact of FX, our trailing 12-month gross retention rate for the second quarter was 87%, in line with what we reported at the end of Q1. And we are pleased that our net retention rate for Q2 improved versus Q1 as NRR was 107% after adjusting for the impact of FX compared to 106% at the end of the first quarter. And as we see more and more examples of customer expansion, like TJ described, we expect this trend to continue. To remind you, our medium-term target for GRR is 90% plus and for NRR is 110% to 115%. Both GRR and NRR improved on a reported basis as Q2 gross retention rate was 85%, and Q2 net retention rate was 104%.This compares favorably to reported gross and net retention rates of 84% and 102% at the end of the first quarter, respectively. Turning back to the income statement. Gross profit for the quarter was $46.1 million, representing a gross margin of 71.1% compared to 73.4% in Q2 2022. The year-over-year gross margin decline is primarily the result of lower gross margins on services. Q2 operating expenses totaled $43.3 million or 67% of revenues compared to $42.1 million or 75% of revenues a year ago, representing a year-over-year growth in dollars of only 3% and a significant reduction as a percentage of revenue. As a result, Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $2.9 million or an operating margin of 4.4%, once again above the high end of our guidance.This compares to an operating loss of $1.2 million or an operating margin of negative 2.1% a year ago as our sustained focus on profitable growth drove year-over-year margin expansion of more than 650 basis points. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $222.9 million in cash and short-term investments. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, cash generated from operations was $9.3 million, while free cash flow was $8.5 million. This compares to cash used of $6.6 million and free cash flow of negative $8.8 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2022. Lastly, with regard to share repurchases, during the 6 months ended June 30th, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for a total cost of approximately $17 million.And through the close of trading yesterday, we have repurchased a total of 4.4 million shares for a total cost of approximately $23.8 million so far in 2023. As a reminder, our plan is to utilize $50 million for the year in repurchasing shares. I would now like to turn to our financial outlook where for the full year, we are pleased to once again raise our expectations for total ARR, total revenues and operating income. For the third quarter, we expect total revenues of $67.6 million to $69.6 million or 9% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP operating income of $5 million to $6 million, and for the full year, we now expect total ARR of $258 million to $263 million or 21% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We now expect total revenues of $261.9 million to $265.9 million or approximately 14% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.Lastly, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $15.9 million to $17.4 million. We'll open for Q&amp;A in a moment, but first, I wanted to provide some additional color on our guidance with a focus on our cost expectations for the balance of the year. While still early, we are beginning to see some signs of stabilization in the demand trends we closely monitor. And as such, we are starting to make some incremental investments to ensure we are well positioned for continued growth in 2024 and beyond. Second, we will meet conditions necessary to be deemed a large accelerated filer as of December 31, 2023. And as a result, we expect some incremental costs in Q3 and Q4 relative to our prior guidance. Taken together, these 2 factors are why we are not raising our full year operating income guidance beyond the outperformance we achieved in Q2, but we are extremely pleased that even after factoring this in, our Q3 operating margin guidance represents year-over-year expansion of nearly 450 basis points, and our new full year operating margin guidance represents year-over-year expansion of approximately 750 basis points.In summary, this was a strong quarter and a continuation of our momentum from Q1. While we remain mindful of near-term economic uncertainty, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we see in 2023 and beyond to deliver shareholder value by advancing the digital workplace, capturing large and growing markets and prioritizing profitable growth. Thanks for joining us today. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.

57,bcabf82b-bc05-3496-87ad-af88a2391705,MSFT,2023-08-12,Alibaba's Restructuring Is Reenergizing Its Businesses,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-restructuring-reenergizing-businesses-163621384.html,1691771781,STORY,"['9988.HK', 'MSFT', 'META', 'AMZN', 'BABA']","[On Thursday, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) reported solid quarterly results that outperformed both top and bottom line expectations, with revenue having its strongest expansion since 2021's September quarter. Alibaba reported a strong performance like its U.S. peer Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and with its AI efforts, it is going up directly against Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). Unsurprisingly, the company’s U.S.-traded shares rose by 4.5% in premarket trading.Quarterly HighlightsFor the quarter that ended on June 30th, Alibaba reported its revenue rose 14% YoY as it amounted to 234.16 billion yuan or $32.29 billion, topping the expected 224.92 billion yuan. Alibaba made 34.33 billion yuan in net income attributable to shareholders that rose at an impressive rate of 51% YoY, also topping the 28.66 billion yuan that Refinitiv’s survey of analysts expected.Alibaba’s Performance Per Business UnitThe two main businesses, Taobao and Tmall Group, experienced a 12% YoY rise to 114.95 billion yuan. Taobao, the app for online shopping, experienced a 6.5% YoY rise in daily active users in June, and more than 7% in July.Alibaba’s overseas efforts bore fruits as international commerce retail experienced a 60% YoY rise in revenue to 17.14 billion yuan. International revenue fueled Alibaba’s Cainiao logistics business that rose 34% to 23.16 billion yuan.The cloud business rose 4% as it brought in revenue of 25.12 billion yuan, with its results dragged down by a drop in revenue from top customers, reduced need for demand work, along with streaming and education services, as the country abandoned its strict and limiting COVID-19 measures. AI marks the beginning of a new eraStory continuesThe internet conglomerate is focusing on the long-term possibilities that are coming with an AI-shaped future as opposed to merely taking advantage of a short-term opportunity. Alibaba highlighted its strategy to continue investing in AI development, believing that the Taobao app has the biggest potential to become a one stop AI-powered portal for life and consumption.Catching Up To MicrosoftWith the popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, companies in China have been seeking for similar offerings as the Microsoft-backed offering isn’t officially available in the country. Due to the regulatory scrutiny in China, such products have been focused on business workings as opposed to publicly available chatbots. Embracing this momentum, Alibaba launched its large language model in April named Tongyi Qianwen that allows AI content creation in English and Chinese, with this kind of LLM being like the one that is powering ChatGPT that Microsoft integrated in its offerings. But earlier this month, Alibaba also announced it is opening a version of this model to third-party developers, directly challenging Meta. Last month, Alibaba also launched an AI service that generates images from prompts, named Tongyi Wanxiang.Challenging Meta By Open-sourcing Its AI ModelTongyi Qianwen has different model sizes and the seven billion parameters and the seven-billion-parameter model called Qwen-7B will be open-sourced, along with Qwen-7B-Chat, a version designed for conversational apps. By open sourcing, Alibaba aims to claim its leading tech role, challenging the U.S. tech giant Meta who made a similar move and threatening ChatGPT, its creator Open AI and partner Microsoft. Earlier this year, Meta has open-sourced its Llama large language model to researchers and it is actively working to boost its adoption by collaborating with tech firms. Last month, Microsoft also revealed is Llama 2 will be available on its Azure cloud-computing service.Reorganization Aims To Unleash New Energy Across Alibaba’s BusinessesCEO and Chairman Daniel Zhang summarized that Alibaba’s international push has already bore fruits although the domestic consumer demand remain sluggish as the Chinese economy didn’t rebound as quickly as anticipated, with second quarter GDP being lower than expected. Zhang will be stepping down as CEO to take charge of the cloud computing business that is marching towards its public debut. Alibaba veteran Eddie Wu will be getting at the CEO helm and Joe Tsai will be the new chairman. On one hand, regulatory pressure is easing as Chinese authorities desire to support the confidence in the private sector, yet on the other, Alibaba is facing significant competitive pressure amid a sputtering economy. But the latest results show encouraging trends for the Chinese e-commerce giant.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip stocks, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Out of these, a mere handful manages to catch public attention due to a variety of factors. These firms can either be popular household names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), firms that have created new industries like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or companies that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and are known for their financial stability and strength.Firms at the top of the stock market food chain are often referred to as Blue Chip stocks. The term 'Blue Chip' is more than a century old, and as you might have guessed, it comes from poker where players assign a monetary value to chips and then gamble on them with cards. A blue chip stock in the 1920s would typically have a share price greater than $200 and the term was coined by a reporter for Dow Jones. These days, there are no fixed criteria to define a firm as a blue chip, however, the typical classification normally includes the 30 stocks included in the Dow 30 index.Investing in blue chip stocks typically offers a variety of benefits that one might be unable to accrue when investing in other stocks such as penny stocks or small cap stocks. These firms are typically quite resilient to significant share price drops due to their size and stability, and their popularity also provides the market with plenty of liquidity. Not to mention, several blue chip stocks also pay dividends. We took a closer look at blue chip firms with large market capitalization and stable dividend growth as part of our 12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy coverage and determined that the top dividend paying stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesAugust is an important month for the stock market as it will see several large firms report their earnings for the second quarter of 2023. These earnings come at a time when high interest rates take their toll on corporate spending, but lowering inflation provides consumers with more leeway to make expensive purchases. To add to this, the earnings also provide important hints about the current state of the U.S. economy, to enable analysts and economists to determine whether a recession might materialize just when everybody starts looking the other way.One blue chip stock that reported its earnings in August is Apple. The largest technology company in the world saw its quarterly revenue drop for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the revenue for the first three quarters also fell. However, Apple still beat analyst EPS estimates due to lower costs in administrative and other expenses. Another blue chip firm and one whose sales are closely watched to measure consumer spending power is Coca-Cola. It is the largest beverage company in the world and one that had a strong second quarter as it managed to beat analyst EPS estimates by a wide margin. Coca-Cola reported $12 billion in net revenues for the quarter, which marked a 6% annual growth. The results indicated that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation, and the revenue growth also enabled Coca-Cola to report a 34% GAAP EPS growth.However, for the beverages company, the biggest takeaway from its second quarter of 2023 earnings was not the revenue or the EPS figures. Instead, it was Coca-Cola's guidance, as the company upgraded its non-GAAP revenue guidance to predict an 8% to 9% organic growth for the full year 2023. Corporate guidance is a crucial factor in an earnings season like the one we're currently in the middle of. This is because firms have a real time view of their operations which leaves them in a better position to predict future outcomes. These outcomes, when put together, can also provide the tea leaves to make a prediction of the broader economic performance.Joining Coca-Cola as an important company whose earnings guidance and financial performance are also an economic barometer is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The retailer has direct contact with consumers due to its business model, and while it has not reported its latest earnings, investment bank Credit Suisse has some good news for the stock as it has increased Walmart's share price target to $180 from $170. Credit Suisse believes that Walmart is positioned well to handle any volatility in consumer spending as its entire approach is based on providing customers with value.With this context, let's take a look at the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to Wall Street. The stocks leading the pack are The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street AnalystsNorthfoto / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to analysts, we calculated the share price upside for blue chip companies based on their average share price target data from Yahoo Finance.

Schultz et al., No. 22-00267, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Washington"" instead of ""Craig v. Target Corp. et al., No. 23-00599, U.S. District Court, Middle District Of Florida."")By Jody GodoyAug 11 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday dismissed as frivolous a conservative activist investor's lawsuit against Starbucks' board for the coffee chain's diversity, equity and inclusion policies.The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) sued in August 2022 over Starbucks' setting hiring goals for Black and other people of color, awarding contracts to ""diverse"" suppliers and advertisers, and tying executive pay to diversity.The nonprofit, which holds around $6,000 in Starbucks stock, said those policies require the company to make race-based decisions that violate federal and state civil rights laws.Chief U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian in Spokane, Washington, rejected the allegations at a hearing in the case on Friday, saying the lawsuit centered on public policy questions that are for lawmakers and corporations, not courts, to decide.""If the plaintiff doesn't want to be invested in 'woke' corporate America, perhaps it should seek other investment opportunities rather than wasting this court's time,"" he said.Starbucks said it was pleased with the decision and said it remains committed to ""creating a culture of warmth and belonging.""Starbucks' attorney Gregory Watts argued at the hearing that NCPPR has condemned the ""evils"" perpetrated by ""woke"" corporate America, and that the group has made demands of many other corporations, including JPMorgan Chase and American Airlines Group Inc.""The use of such language shows what is motivating plaintiffs, and it is not the business interests of Starbucks,"" he said.Story continuesThe lawsuit is similar to those recently by conservative activist groups opposing corporate diversity and inclusion efforts in the wake of a June Supreme Court ruling.The ruling declared unlawful the race-conscious student admissions policies used by Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.On Friday, Daniel Morenoff of The American Civil Rights Project, who represents NCPPR, argued that Starbucks policies seeking to increase racial diversity among its suppliers, vendors, and employees were discriminatory and that NCPPR's cause was in the corporate interest.Bastian rejected that argument, saying the group's complaint did not represent the interests of Starbucks shareholders and failed to follow required legal procedure.NCPPR may not refile its complaint, and Starbucks may seek legal fees, he said.NCPPR spokesperson Scott Shepard called the judge's comments ""surprising and disappointing.""""We will continue to pursue relief from illegal discrimination on behalf of shareholders and employees,"" he said.The case is National Center for Public Policy Research v.

Schultz et al., No. 22-00267, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Washington,' not 'Craig v. Target Corp. et al., No. 23-00599, U.S. District Court, Middle District Of Florida,' in paragraph 16)A U.S. judge on Friday dismissed as frivolous a conservative activist investor's lawsuit against Starbucks' board for the coffee chain's diversity, equity and inclusion policies.The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) sued in August 2022 over Starbucks' setting hiring goals for Black and other people of color, awarding contracts to ""diverse"" suppliers and advertisers, and tying executive pay to diversity.The nonprofit, which holds around $6,000 in Starbucks stock, said those policies require the company to make race-based decisions that violate federal and state civil rights laws.Chief U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian in Spokane, Washington, rejected the allegations at a hearing in the case on Friday, saying the lawsuit centered on public policy questions that are for lawmakers and corporations, not courts, to decide.""If the plaintiff doesn't want to be invested in 'woke' corporate America, perhaps it should seek other investment opportunities rather than wasting this court's time,"" he said.Starbucks said it was pleased with the decision and said it remains committed to ""creating a culture of warmth and belonging.""Starbucks' attorney Gregory Watts argued at the hearing that NCPPR has condemned the ""evils"" perpetrated by ""woke"" corporate America, and that the group has made demands of many other corporations, including JPMorgan Chase and American Airlines Group Inc.""The use of such language shows what is motivating plaintiffs, and it is not the business interests of Starbucks,"" he said.Story continuesThe lawsuit is similar to those recently by conservative activist groups opposing corporate diversity and inclusion efforts in the wake of a June Supreme Court ruling.The ruling declared unlawful the race-conscious student admissions policies used by Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.On Friday, Daniel Morenoff of The American Civil Rights Project, who represents NCPPR, argued that Starbucks policies seeking to increase racial diversity among its suppliers, vendors, and employees were discriminatory and that NCPPR's cause was in the corporate interest.Bastian rejected that argument, saying the group's complaint did not represent the interests of Starbucks shareholders and failed to follow required legal procedure.NCPPR may not refile its complaint, and Starbucks may seek legal fees, he said.NCPPR spokesperson Scott Shepard called the judge's comments ""surprising and disappointing.""""We will continue to pursue relief from illegal discrimination on behalf of shareholders and employees,"" he said.The case is National Center for Public Policy Research v.

That is because the Sep 15, 2023 $17.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Parker-Hannifin shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Parker-Hannifin is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Manufacturing - General Industrial industry that ranks in the Top 21% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimate. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $5.26 per share to $5.29 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Parker-Hannifin right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

She sued Southwest and won.Starr, nominated to the bench by former President Donald Trump, said Southwest didn't understand federal protections for religious freedom. So this week, he ordered three of the airline's lawyers to undergo religious-liberty training. And he said that the Alliance Defending Freedom, or ADF, “is particularly well-suited"" to do the training.The group has gained attention — and high-profile court victories — opposing abortion, defending a baker and a website designer who didn't want to work on same-sex marriages, and seeking to limit transgender rights. It frequently cites First Amendment rights in its litigation.ADF declined to describe its training or to make a representative available for an interview. In an emailed statement, its chief legal counsel, Jim Campbell, said, “The judge’s order calls for ADF to provide training in religious liberty law — not religious doctrine. It is baseless to suggest that people of faith cannot provide legal instruction if their beliefs differ from their audience’s.”Southwest has appealed Starr's sanctions, which also include emailing a statement that the judge wrote to its flight attendants to say that airline is not permitted to discriminate based on employee's religious beliefs. The airline, which is based in Dallas, is already appealing the jury verdict in the flight attendant's favor.Story continuesDavid Lopez, who was general counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the Obama administration, said Southwest could argue that training by a conservative Christian group violates the religious rights of its lawyers, especially if any follow other faiths or none at all.Lopez said the EEOC often insisted on training for employers found to have discriminated, but that the agency and the company would agree on who would conduct that training.“What happened here, I've never seen that,” said Lopez, who is now a law professor at Rutgers University.ADF is “just one voice” on the subject of religious freedom, Lopez said, “and they are a voice that many people view as being very controversial and very narrow.”Douglas Laycock, an authority on religious-liberty law who recently retired as a law professor at the University of Virginia, said judges can order extra measures such as training to make sure defendants comply with the rest of an order, but Southwest still has avenues to appeal.Southwest could argue “that ADF has extreme views on these issues and will give distorted training, and there is something to that,” Laycock said. Or, he said, the airline could argue that ADF is essentially a religious organization, and that requiring Southwest lawyers to take training from the group would violate their rights.“ADF presents itself as a religious-liberty organization, but it is really a Christian organization,"" Laycock said. ""It isn’t much interested in anyone else’s religious liberty.”Steven Collis, director of a law and religion clinic at the University of Texas at Austin, said it is within a judge's authority to order this kind of training.“I do think it's questionable ordering that training to be done by a group that is clearly partisan on issues related to religious freedom,” Collis added. “He could have avoided criticism by ordering this from someone who is a little more neutral ... use an academic instead.”Judge Starr was nominated by Trump in 2019 and confirmed by the Senate, then under Republican control, in a party-line, 51-39 vote.The nephew of Kenneth Starr, a former federal judge who led the investigations into former President Bill Clinton that led to Clinton's impeachment in a sex scandal, Starr graduated from Abilene Christian University and earned a law degree from the University of Texas at Austin, where he was editor of a conservative law journal.Starr held senior jobs in the Texas Attorney General’s office. According to a questionnaire he filled out for the Senate Judiciary Committee, he worked on a lawsuit against the Obama administration for telling public schools to let transgender students decide which restrooms to use, defended a state law that banned sanctuary cities for immigrants, and sued to block a plan to defer deportation of some undocumented immigrants.Starr, who had not previously served as a judge at any level, is a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group.The Southwest case stems from the airline's decision to fire Charlene Carter, a flight attendant for more than 20 years, after a series of social media posts and private messages aimed at the president of the flight attendant's union for attending an anti-Trump, pro-abortion-rights march in Washington in January 2017.In one message Carter told the union president, “You truly are Despicable in so many ways,"" and attached video that purported to show an aborted fetus. An hour later, she sent another video of an aborted fetus.Carter took the case to arbitration but lost. She then sued, and last year a jury in Dallas awarded her $5.1 million from Southwest and the union. Starr later reduced the judgment to about $800,000 to, he said, comply with federal limits on punitive damages.Both the airline and the union are challenging the decision before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has not decided whether to hear the case.Carter is represented by lawyers from the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which argues that union-represented workers should not be required to pay dues.After Starr's ruling this week, foundation President Mark Mix said, ""Hopefully this order provides hope to other independent minded workers that their right to express their religious dissent against union and company political agendas cannot so easily be waved away.”]"

Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) should not be ignored. The company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) a hidden gem or a value trap?Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV): A Brief OverviewSouthwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) is the largest domestic air carrier in the United States by passengers boarded. The company operates over 700 aircraft in an all-Boeing 737 fleet. Despite offering some longer routes and a few perks for business travelers, the airline predominantly specializes in short-haul, leisure flights, using a point-to-point network. Southwest operates a low-cost carrier business model.Southwest Airlines Co (LUV): A Hidden Gem or a Potential Value Trap?Declining Revenues and Earnings: A Bearish SignOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV), both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 40.23; 2021: 16.33; 2022: 34.57; 2023: 40.01) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-5.1%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory.Story continuesSouthwest Airlines Co (LUV): A Hidden Gem or a Potential Value Trap?Sluggish Earnings Growth: A Red FlagThe company's earnings picture does not look much brighter. The 3-year EPS without NRI growth rate (-41.2%) is sluggish, and the future 3 to 5-year EPS growth estimate (37.66%) does not show a promising uptick.Is Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) a Value Trap?Despite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV)'s falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.Finding Growth Stocks with Low ValuationInvestors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The tie-up aims to provide an advanced digital platform, which can be accessed at myCigna by specific employer-sponsored plan clients of Cigna Healthcare from the very beginning of 2024.The new platform is an initiative to extend a connected and more customized experience to bring enhanced whole-person well-being for around 11 million customers of Cigna. And taking the help of Virgin Pulse seems to be an apt move on the part of CI since the former leverages AI-powered technology and behavior change science, which imparts clients the ability to manage their mental, physical and social health. Subsequently, an individual can make better health choices, set attainable targets and earn financial rewards.The platform empowers users with the flexibility to connect a compatible fitness device or input some basic daily metrics, like weight or number of hours slept, and consequently, keep a check on their progress. On the basis of the customers’ information, preferences and claims experience, myCigna will direct them to other suitable programs of Cigna Healthcare linked with pre-diabetes management or behavioral health services.The latest initiative reflects Cigna’s ardent endeavor to extend advanced digital solutions to its health plan clients. This, in turn, might lure more plan sponsors and clients to opt for Cigna Healthcare’s plans and thereby, provide an impetus to the segment in the days ahead. Through this unit, Cigna serves customers of U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses.An increase in the customer base is expected to fetch higher premiums for Cigna, which remain the most significant contributor to any health insurer’s top line.

(NYSE:GS) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 69% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.6% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 0.4% for shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Goldman Sachs Group which might hurt individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Goldman Sachs Group, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Goldman Sachs Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Goldman Sachs Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Goldman Sachs Group is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.7% and 5.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$640m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 31% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Goldman Sachs Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Goldman Sachs Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +2.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.4% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 10% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share, indicating a change of +22.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.99 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +37.2%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 indicates a change of +24.9% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $8.33 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.4%. The $32.92 billion and $36.65 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.2% and +11.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.6%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.65%. The EPS surprise was +1.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Meaning, you will need to purchase Phillips 66's shares before the 17th of August to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.05 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.20 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Phillips 66 has a trailing yield of 3.6% on the current stock price of $116.64. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Phillips 66 has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Phillips 66 Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Phillips 66 is paying out just 17% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Luckily it paid out just 25% of its free cash flow last year.It's positive to see that Phillips 66's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Phillips 66's earnings per share have risen 20% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Phillips 66 has delivered 15% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayIs Phillips 66 an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Phillips 66 has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. There's a lot to like about Phillips 66, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Phillips 66 is facing. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Phillips 66 (1 doesn't sit too well with us) you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Yahoo Finance Live takes a look at the state of retail, looking back on analyst comments on retail demand heading into the latter half of 2023 and 2024, the Tapestry (TPR) and Capri (CPRI) acquisition deal, and average credit card spending by consumers and households.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: The spotlight shifts to retail next week with several earnings on tap along with retail sales. We've got big box retailers like Home Depot, Target, and Walmart first up to the plate. And so we wanted to look back at some of the tea leaves that we've gotten thus far and then look ahead to what we could hear next week.Among the various tea leaves that we got in the past week was a big deal within the retail industry--BRAD SMITH: HugeJULIE HYMAN: --in the form of Tapestry buying Capri for $8 and 1/2 billion. We talked to some folks about that. We've been sort of looking at what's been going on in specialty retail. And one of the things, one of our sort of takeaways or themes that we've been seeing here is-- and this has been a longer term thing, sluggish retail sales in the face of some of that spending going to services.And that seems to be continuing to some extent, although we've seen little glimmers of spending certainly on stuff.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And it was exciting putting together our what to watch for this earnings season for retail, specifically here because one of the other areas too that has continued to be brought up-- and, hey, there you see our little cartoon faces is the inventory. And we discussed this with Adrienne Yih. She brought this up in our conversation earlier this week, talking about how companies are needing to clean through that inventory.I believe we have a short clip of some of her commentary and what she's expecting this retail earnings season as well.ADRIENNE YIH: We're in the early, early phase of our wholesalers will go into retailers. If they can hold on to the guy and basically do the back half and get to those earnings and off margins with freight and promo recovery and below the top line, and then have top line on tight inventory, that's what you call the bout for 2024.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: And so the reason why inventory is so important is because of the promotional cycle we've seen companies have to deploy by not having that inventory marker correct. And so many of them right-sizing that kind of demand projection for what their inventory would look like. That's been key to making sure that they're more-- there are more full price sales.Think about what you hear from companies like Under Armor, which already reported and companies like Nike and many of the direct to consumer companies. The amount of the inventory that they're able to sell at full price, they're communicating that to investors, Adrienne Yih pointing out that earlier this week. And that tight inventory scenario that helps them out even further to ensure that they can hit some of those full price markers that they're looking for.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Inventory is also something that Simeon Siegel spoke about, one of BMO when we talked to him about the Tapestry Capri deal. And he also talked about where we are after a couple of roller coaster years for the retailers. He said in this moment, it's all about execution on the part of the individual retailers.SIMEON SIEGEL: We're actually back to an environment where retailers can run their businesses. Beginning of COVID, there was no supply chain, therefore there was no availability. So it didn't matter how good you were at predicting demand, you were at the whim of whatever product made it through the containers. That's no way to run a business. There's no winners and losers there.And then in the last year, it was the opposite, where everyone had so much success inventory, that it also didn't matter how good you were at predicting demand. You were just overflowed with this product that you had to move. We're back to normal, and again, that's a hard thing to say because what is normal, but we're back to an environment where I think the companies that are really good at understanding their consumer and predicting inventory accordingly will win.JULIE HYMAN: So that's kind of interesting, right, is that these retailers are no longer going to be subject to the winds of supply chain dynamics and consumer dynamics as to the same degree that they were over the past couple of years. It's going to matter more about how the management teams are doing when it comes to these companies.Now that said, the first thing that we talked about, sluggish retail sales perhaps in the face of services spending was highlighted by a couple of charts that we got from the Bank of America Institute in their monthly look at consumer spending when it comes to retail.And one of the things they looked at was the boost that we saw around the July 4th holiday here. But they compared 2022 to 2023. And we are seeing 2023 run at a little bit of a higher rate here. So that's something that should be encouraging perhaps when we await those overall July retail numbers.And they also have been tracking retail excluding restaurants and services-- including restaurants, excuse me. And basically, we are seeing those two sort of come back into line which suggests perhaps a little bit of a resurgence in good spending in line with services spending, which is intriguing. You know, who knows if that's what we're going to see writ large coming from these retailers and coming from the retail sales numbers.BRAD SMITH: It's particularly interesting on the credit side of the spending equation too because if there's one thing that we've talked about time and time again, consumers may not be breaking right now, but they certainly are pivoting how they are spending and where they're deploying cash that might be on the household balance sheet, or perhaps tapping to pay or swiping to pay that much more quickly because they know it's something that maybe they can pay off just later on down the line for a purchase that they want or maybe need right now.And that kind of contributes back into the data that came out of the New York Fed and how some of the household debt and credit report that they put forward.Right now, we're seeing credit card balances saw growth rising by $45 billion to a series high of over trillion dollars right now. And so that coming out from the New York Fed, you pair that with what some of the larger companies that are going to be reporting are already saying about how they're engaging with consumers. It's how the consumer is spending, but also where that spending and the guidance might dampen further.And so I'll just wrap on this, the impact of student loan payments resumption, that continues to come up in analyst conversation right now, could be something that impacts the guidance going forward.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, the student loan repayment buzzword and the excess savings buzzword are really going to be important for the outlooks for retail and services spending for that matter, just how are people spending money as they maybe have less of it. We'll see.]"

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $39.8 million, the contract is projected to be completed by June 2025. Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide lead yard support and development studies and design efforts related to Virginia class submarines.Work related to this contract will be executed in the continental U.S.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly due to upgrading and improvising defense systems with technologically advanced features. Military submarines with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form an integral part of any nation’s defense system.The increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Electric Boat business unit is a prime contractor of submarines.Looking ahead, General Dynamics, along with an industry partner, is currently working on Blocks IV and V in the Virginia Class program. The company has 17 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog, scheduled for delivery through 2032.Notably, nine of the boats in Block V include the Virginia Payload Module, an 84-foot Electric Boat-designed-and-built hull section that adds four additional payload tubes, more than tripling the strike capacity of these submarines and providing unique capabilities to support special missions.Electric Boat is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering, leading the construction of Virginia-class attack submarines. The aforementioned developments should usher in more contracts for General Dynamics, like the latest one. These contracts, in turn, are expected to boost the company’s growth.Story continuesPeer MovesNations are strengthening their defense capabilities. Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% during 2023-2028. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the military submarine space.A few defense primes that can reap the benefits of the expanding submarine market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines, the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines, can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.BAESY’s long-term earnings growth rate is 14.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 15.7%.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. It also provides launch systems for submarines. NOC’s eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.5%.Huntington Ingalls has a teaming agreement with Electric Boat to build Virginia-class fast-attack nuclear submarines. Its Newport News division is participating in the design and construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HII’s 2023 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 3.2%. Huntington Ingalls delivered an average earnings surprise of 1.76% in the last four quarters.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, General Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.NRG Energy in FocusBased in Houston, NRG Energy (NRG) is in the Utilities sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 16.06%. The power company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.38 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.09%. This compares to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.65% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.62%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.51 is up 7.9% from last year. In the past five-year period, NRG Energy has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 88.27%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. NRG's current payout ratio is 48%. This means it paid out 48% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.NRG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.66 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 77.86%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, NRG is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To have our workplace and culture recognized by our own employees and peers across our industry is demonstrative of the amazing workplace and work we have cultivated at NRG. Our team's number of talented, ambitious, creative, and dedicated people speaks volumes, but I will take every opportunity to laud and celebrate them.We believe our success begins and ends with the people we employ. They are our most important asset; as such, we continuously evolve to best meet their needs. We attract and retain standout talent by developing programs and approaches that ensure our people feel valued and connected, all while fostering a culture centered on safety and well-being.To achieve this ambition, we prioritize four key elements of the employee experience:Finding new and creative ways to draw in new talent and open avenues for recruitment to ensure we have a diverse applicant pool.Deploying and maintaining programs and initiatives to improve the employee experience by ensuring benefits remain competitive and by cultivating meaningful career progression and development opportunities.Prioritizing employees' physical, mental, and financial well-being through holistic wellness programs and comprehensive safety standards.Building a unified and inclusive culture where a strong sense of belonging leads to better teamwork and business performance.Over the years, these priorities have led us to implement a variety of new initiatives that have strengthened our workplace and corporate culture.

We also increased paid parental leave to six weeks, regardless of gender.Story continuesThese efforts do more than make us competitive -they make employees excited to be part of NRG.We envision a workplace defined by a sense of camaraderie and teamwork that values diversity and fosters inclusion, encourages collaboration, supports individual and team growth, and ensures work-life balance.

The company’s focus on cleaner power generation and growth in domestic operation acts as a tailwind.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s dependence on its subsidiaries and rising competition in the transmission business act as headwinds.TailwindsPPL expects a regulated capital investment of $12 billion during 2023-2026 and plans nearly $2.5 billion in capital investments for 2023. The company’s capital investment plan primarily focuses on infrastructure construction projects for generation, transmission and distribution. Customers have been experiencing far less outages, courtesy of the ongoing investments for strengthening PPL’s infrastructure.The company plans to achieve its carbon emissions target of 70% by 2035 and 80% by 2040, from its 2010 levels. It will do so through the introduction of new carbon capture technology and the addition of more renewable sources to its generation portfolio.The completion of the Narragansett Electric Company’s acquisition on May 25, 2022, gives PPL a more diversified asset portfolio, lowering income from coal generation and increasing the chances of investing in a sustainable energy future.The company is working to lower outstanding debt and strengthen the balance sheet. It is also focused on reducing its operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs by at least $175 million through 2026. In 2023, it expects to save $50-$60 million in O&amp;M costs. PPL expects to reduce total operating expenses in the coming years, owing to a decrease in fuel cost and energy purchases.HeadwindsThe company conducts all operations through its subsidiaries. PPL’s consolidated assets are also held by its subsidiaries. Its ability to repay debt, guarantee obligations and pay dividends is largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries.PPL’s Pennsylvania Regulated segment faces competition for transmission projects.

ALC is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 16, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) of 70 cents exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.67%. Moreover, its earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and were in line with estimates in one. The average earnings surprise was 8.85%.Let's see how things have shaped up before the announcement.Factors at PlaySimilar to the first quarter of 2023, strong commercial execution, new product launches and demand from resilient markets are expected to have contributed to the top line in the second quarter.Alcon’s Surgical business is expected to have been boosted by the strength of the company’s CENTURION and LEGION devices.  The company noted earlier that customers continue to be pleased with the performance of Centurion with Active Sentry, which enhances safety and confidence during surgery. Further, there remains a sizable installed base of Legacy, Infiniti, Laureate and other machines in the international markets.This is likely to have boosted the company’s Surgical business in this region.Further, Alcon might have benefitted from the high win rate of Argos Biometer. Results from a real-world study highlight that Argos delivers significant time efficiencies for patients during cataract evaluation. On the first-quarter earnings call, the company noted that it has started rolling out Argos across international markets and customer reception has been positive. This might have contributed to Alcon’s Surgical business in the second quarter.Alcon Price and EPS SurpriseAlcon Price and EPS SurpriseAlcon price-eps-surprise | Alcon QuoteHowever, the South Korean market might have faced a tough comparison owing toa change in PCIOL reimbursement in Korea last year, which increased demand during that period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 Surgical revenues is pegged at $1.33 billion. This suggests a 2.8% rise from the previous quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesWithin Alcon’s Vision Care segment, contact lens and ocular health franchises are expected to have contributed to the second-quarter top line.The company continues to receive favorable market feedback for its portfolio of innovative lenses and is focused on expanding its contact lens offerings. Alcon earlier envisioned its toric lens portfolio to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the contact lens market. Further, the company, on its first-quarter earnings call, particularly talked about the continued strong market uptake of its portfolio of SiHy lenses. This trend should have continued in the second quarter as well.The ocular health segment is likely to have performed well in the second quarter of 2023, driven by a wide range of SYSTANE preservative-free dry eye relief products, including HYDRATION PF, Ultra and Complete.However, similar to the first quarter of 2023, we believe Alcon is likely to have met ongoing supply-chain challenges in the to-be-reported quarter, affecting its revenue growth.Our model estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 Vision Care revenues is pegged at $964.6 million. This suggests an improvement of 6.7% from the previous quarter’s reported figure.The Estimate PictureFor the second quarter of 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $2.34 billion implies an improvement of 6.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.The consensus estimate for EPS is pegged at 62 cents, indicating a fall of 1.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has a higher chance of beating estimates.

The key medical product stocks that have released their earnings so far showed market share gain within their base businesses through the months of the second quarter compared with the corresponding period of 2022. These companies reported rising as well as better-than-expected earnings and revenues. However, ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in the form of inflation and currency woes put pressure on the bottom line.The Earnings Trends report indicates that as of Aug 9, 91.4% of the companies in the Medical sector, representing 96% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported quarterly earnings. About 86.8% of the participants beat on earnings while 77.4% beat on revenues. While earnings declined 30.7% year over year, revenues rose 5% from the year-ago period’s level. Revenues were driven by improving demand for medical products while the same remained subdued due to rising inflationary pressure and interest expense. Overall, second-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline 30% and sales are expected to increase 5.4% from the year-ago quarter’s respective reported figures.Zeroing in on WinnersBelow, we have highlighted three medical product companies — Neogen NEOG, Patterson Companies PDCO and Definitive Healthcare DH — that are expected to deliver a beat in their upcoming quarterly result.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining the stocks with the best chance to deliver an earnings surprise.

From December 2019 through November 2021, researchers at the British Columbia Centre on Substance Use and the University of California, Los Angeles surveyed 205 people who used cannabis and opioids without a prescription. Through their survey, researchers learned that nearly 60% of respondents used cannabis to reduce opioid cravings. Further analysis showed that the cannabis use of those surveyed ""was significantly associated with self-reported reductions"" in opioid use.""Increasing the accessibility of cannabis products for therapeutic use may be a useful supplementary strategy to mitigate exposure to unregulated opioids and associated harm during the ongoing drug toxicity crisis,"" the authors of the study wrote.As the longest-running dedicated cannabis investment firm, Poseidon has had the opportunity of working with many companies and a broad range of investors in our funds. We learned years ago that cannabis was a largely unavailable but highly sought after-exit drug for addiction clinics. It is great to see federal studies confirming these benefits, especially with the years-long opioid epidemic that continues to wreak havoc on communities nationwide. This study also arrives as work is being done around the potential rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule 1 under the Control Substances Act, which is long overdue.The Baked Big Apple: Study Crowns New York City as Cannabis Consumption CapitalIt is best to examine the health of the cannabis industry at the state level. In Missouri, the commencement of adult-use sales has led to great success for the state's overall cannabis industry. Similarly, the adult-use market in Maryland is experiencing great success after launching in July. However, there is one state that has not experienced the success that many had hoped it would, and that is New York. The Empire State's lack of early success in the adult-use market could be attributed to decisions by public officials thus far. Despite this, there are still reasons to believe that New York will eventually be one of the largest legal cannabis markets in the U.S. Among those reasons for optimism in New York is the love many of its residents have for cannabis.Story continuesThe 2023 Cannabis Global Price Index has crowned the Big Apple as the cannabis consumption capital of the world. New York City residents consume an average of 62.3 metric tons of weed combined every year. In comparison, residents of Sydney, which finished in second, consume 45.8 metric tons of cannabis each year. For those of us that have lived in New York, this is not a surprise. The city's relaxed attitude regarding cannabis consumption coupled with its population density make it a prime destination for those who love the plant and want the industry to thrive in the Empire State. And as Buffalo, N.Y. natives, we are rooting for the good people of New York as we still do for the Buffalo Bills — our day will come!Experts Say Maryland Adult-Use Market Could Grow to $1 BillionThere is plenty to unpack as many public cannabis companies move into the thick of the second-quarter earnings season. The industry is diverging from the few that are showing better capital allocation, cost controls and governance. However, there is a clear, bright spot in Maryland, as noted in some of the initial earnings calls so far.On July 1, residents and visitors across Maryland filed into dispensaries as the state's adult-use market launched. In a matter of weeks, cannabis sales skyrocketed from $42.7 million in June to $87.4 million in July. Retail store operators in Maryland are noting a 200% or more increase in sales volumes from the run rate of the medical market. As access to and awareness of the adult-use market improves, it is poised to cross the $1 billion market.""We're excited, we're optimistic,"" Andrew Garrison of the Maryland Cannabis Administration said about the future of the state's adult-use market. ""We're going to keep working with the industry to make sure that they're going to meet the demand and are doing so responsibly.""MasterCard Moves Away from Cannabis IndustryThe legal cannabis industry has received another painful reminder that Capitol Hill is far behind in its recognition of the industry. Without federal reform, cannabis is susceptible to elevated volatility from insurance firms, financial institutions and beyond. For example, Mastercard (MA) has instructed U.S. financial institutions this week to stop allowing purchases of cannabis on its debit cards.""In accordance with our policies, we instructed the financial institutions that offer payments services to cannabis merchants and connects them to Mastercard to terminate the activity,"" a spokesperson for MasterCard said.Unfortunately, this creates an elevated risk for retail operators across the country. The absence of debit transactions forces retailers to pivot to cash transactions, which makes them more susceptible to robberies.""It makes absolutely no sense that legal businesses are being forced to operate entirely in cash, and it's dangerous — and sometimes even fatal — for employees behind the register,"" Washington Senator Patty Murray said.Medical cannabis use is legal in 38 states, three territories and the District of Columbia. Adult-use cannabis is legal in 23 states, two territories and the District of Columbia. As the industry continues to grow, national sales could exceed $57 billion annually by 2030. With an industry this widespread, federal officials can't claim ignorance. Federal reform is needed now more than ever to legalize cannabis banking.Related contentTerrAscend Stock Now Trades on TSX: This Week in Cannabis InvestingMastercard Blocks Debit Card Purchases of Cannabis on Its NetworkBuying Marijuana in These States Helps Fight Substance AbuseCannabis Industry Updates From Capitol Hill]"

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study QUALCOMM's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:42% = US$8.6b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.42 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.QUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 42% ROEFirst thing first, we like that QUALCOMM has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 16% which is quite remarkable. As a result, QUALCOMM's exceptional 42% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that QUALCOMM's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 31% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for QCOM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is QUALCOMM Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The three-year median payout ratio for QUALCOMM is 32%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 68%. So it seems that QUALCOMM is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, QUALCOMM is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 34%. Regardless, QUALCOMM's ROE is speculated to decline to 33% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that QUALCOMM's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

111,4b5bc515-2e2e-37b0-99ab-55bba431bb15,PHM,2023-08-12,Investing in PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) five years ago would have delivered you a 215% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-pultegroup-nyse-phm-five-150154349.html,1691766114,STORY,['PHM'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. One great example is PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) which saw its share price drive 196% higher over five years. It's also good to see the share price up 21% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 9.1% in 90 days).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for PulteGroup In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, PulteGroup achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 37% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 24% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 6.62 also suggests market apprehension.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how PulteGroup has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at PulteGroup's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of PulteGroup, it has a TSR of 215% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that PulteGroup shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 90% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 26% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

(PHM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-inc-phm-trending-stock-130010659.html,1691758810,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned +3.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 2.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.70 per share, indicating a change of +0.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +29.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%. This estimate has changed +25.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.39 indicates a change of +2% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +24.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $3.9 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.1%. The $16.28 billion and $17.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.3% and +5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $4.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $3 for the same period compares with $2.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.9%. The EPS surprise was +21.46%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

RMTI is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 14, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s loss per share of 10 cents was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and lagged once, delivering an earnings surprise of 30.4%, on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the first-quarter 2023 earnings release, Rockwell Medical’s management stated that its quarterly results have highlighted its progress toward its new strategy and business plan, announced in 2022. Management believes that its first-quarter performance and a few notable announcements made in the second quarter (like reducing operating expenses) are likely to have enabled Rockwell Medical to continue to make significant progress toward these goals and objectives. This raises our optimism about the company’s performance in the second quarter of 2023.Effective Jan 1, 2023, Rockwell Medical assumed complete commercial responsibility for Baxter International Inc.’s BAX customers. These customers were previously serviced under an exclusive distribution agreement terminated on Nov 9, 2022, when Rockwell Medical announced that it is reacquiring its distribution rights to its hemodialysis concentrates products from Baxter.Rockwell Medical’s management confirmed that the majority of Baxter’s customers have transitioned successfully to its platform and are actively buying products. Rockwell Medical has been benefiting due to these changes and expects to realize the full impact of these actions during the second quarter of 2023 and beyond. This looks promising for the stock as it is likely to have contributed to its to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.Rockwell Medical, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRockwell Medical, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRockwell Medical, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Rockwell Medical, Inc. QuoteStory continuesRockwell Medical currently sells its hemodialysis concentrates products in various countries throughout North America, South America, Asia and Africa. In May, it expanded its geographic footprint by entering a long-term supply agreement with Global Medical Supply Chain LLC to begin selling its hemodialysis concentrates products in the United Arab Emirates. This looks promising for the stock.In July, Rockwell Medical acquired the hemodialysis concentrates business from Evoqua Water Technologies, which includes all contracts, intellectual property, the FDA’s 510(k) clearances and assets primarily associated with, and related to, Evoqua's concentrates business nationwide, including liquid and powder bicarbonate and liquid acid. In June, Rockwell Medical entered into a three-year co-promotion services agreement with B. Braun Medical Inc. These raise our optimism about Rockwell Medical.Rockwell Medical continued to reduce its operating expenses during the first quarter of 2023 by focusing on enhanced business performance and more efficient manufacturing processes. This had enabled it to narrow its operating loss during the reported quarter. We expect that the company has continued with its cost reduction strategy in the second quarter, thereby boosting its results in the to-be-reported quarter.Another notable announcement by Rockwell Medical was its international partner, Drogsan Pharmaceuticals, submitting a Marketing Authorization application and GMP application for Triferic AVNU to the Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency (April).The Estimate PictureFor second-quarter 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.1 million for total revenues calls for a decline of 3.2% from the prior-year reported figure.The consensus estimate for loss per share is pegged at 12 cents.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates. This is not the case here, as you can see below.Earnings ESP: Rockwell Medical has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

However, the earnings beat ratio of 86.6% and revenue beat ratio of 84.9% are impressive. Combining the actual results with the estimates for the still-to-report companies, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline 30% despite revenue growth of 5.4%.Many industry bigwigs reported solid results, with some beating on earnings or revenues or both.

On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues declined 67% and 54%, respectively. The U.S. drug giant narrowed its revenue guidance to $67-$70.0 billion from $67-$71.0 billion while maintaining its adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $3.25-$3.45.MerckMerck MRK reported better-than-expected results.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Johnson &amp; Johnson in FocusBased in New Brunswick, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) is in the Medical sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -2.54%. The world's biggest maker of health care products is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.19 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.76%. This compares to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.72% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.62%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $4.76 is up 7% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.85%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Johnson &amp; Johnson's current payout ratio is 46%. This means it paid out 46% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.JNJ is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $10.75 per share, with earnings expected to increase 5.91% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, JNJ presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down the story.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Welcome back. The big pharma battle escalates. The Supreme Court has pressed pause on Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy reorganization after President Trump's-- or President Biden's excuse me, objections over protections in the place for the Sackler family.""Yahoo Finance's"" Anjalee Khemlani has been tracking this. She's got the details. Hey, Anjalee.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Hey, Brad. Well, it's good you brought up President Trump because this does go back to that time. But let's fast forward to what happened just now. The US Supreme Court taking a look at what the bankruptcy deal would entail. That includes $6 billion from Purdue Pharma to the victims of the opioid epidemic.The hearing date for this is going to be in December. So that draws out what seemed like it had been a concluded episode in this saga. Purdue Pharma, of course, owned by the Sackler family, formerly, they did withdraw billions of dollars up to $11 billion back in 2020. And have also been seeking protection or indemnity against any future lawsuits.And that's the point of contention for the US government saying that they don't see that as a fair way to go about this. That it is an abuse of the bankruptcy system. And that's been the underpinning point that started this new court decision.And so we're going to have to wait to hear and see how this all plays out. It does have some potential impact on other similar bankruptcy filings by health care companies. And other companies 3M and Johnson&amp;Johnson, for example. We know that Johnson&amp;Johnson does have a bankruptcy filing going on for its TALC litigation. And similarly, has been holding it off in a separate entity.So while it's not quite exactly the same as this Purdue case, it could potentially have some implications for those others. The other one being 3M as well. So this is what experts are saying. That's why all eyes are on this.There has been some opposition from the victims against this new position. And we are going to just have to wait until December to hear the arguments in the Supreme Court. And then a decision likely early next year.BRAD SMITH: All right. ""Yahoo Finance's"" own, Anjalee Khemlani. Thanks so much, Anjalee, for tracking all this. Bringing it to our attention.]"

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 30% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up just 3.0% in the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Johnson &amp; Johnson managed to grow its earnings per share at 58% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Johnson &amp; Johnson's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Johnson &amp; Johnson the TSR over the last 5 years was 48%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveJohnson &amp; Johnson's TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 5.9%. It has to be noted that the recent return falls short of the 8% shareholders have gained each year, over half a decade. Although the share price growth has slowed, the longer term story points to a business well worth watching. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

The bottom line also surpassed the year-ago period’s reported figure of 40 cents due to higher-than-expected contributions from two major segments — West and Northeast G&amp;P.Williams’ revenues of $2.48 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.69 billion due to lower product sales. The top line also decreased from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $2.49 billion.Key TakeawaysAdjusted EBITDA was $1.61 billion in the quarter under review, up 7.3% from the prior-year quarter’s level. The figure also beat our estimate of $1.53 billion. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.38 billion, up 25.5% from that recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022.Segmental AnalysisTransmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico: The segment reported an adjusted EBITDA of $748 billion, up 14.7% from the year-ago quarter’s level. This was largely driven by much higher service revenues. The figure also outpaced our prediction of $636.5 million.West: This segment registered an adjusted EBITDA of $312 million, 5.4% higher than $296 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter. The figure also beat our estimate of $303.3 million. The improvement resulted from contributions from Trace Midstream and the benefits of realized gains on natural gas hedges.Northeast G&amp;P: Adjusted EBITDA for this segment was $515 million, up 14.4% from the prior-year quarter’s $450 million. The figure also beat our estimate of $442.5 million. This uptick in performance can be attributed to higher volumes at Ohio Valley Midstream, Marcellus South and Cardinal.Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services: This unit generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of 16 million against a profit of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. This was due to low commodity margins. The reported figure missed our predicted profit of $51.9 million.Story continuesCosts, Capex &amp; Balance SheetTotal costs and expenses were $1.61 billion in the reported quarter.Total capital expenditure was $715 million compared with $429 million a year ago.

123,24f127af-ff03-3b84-a6f3-501c4a8d32bf,WMB,2023-08-12,4 Oil Pipeline Stocks to Gain Despite Industry Challenges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-oil-pipeline-stocks-gain-123300002.html,1691757180,STORY,"['KMI', 'PAA', 'WMB', 'PAGP', 'MPLX', '^GSPC']","[Although the midstream energy business is less exposed to oil and gas price volatility, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry’s outlook is still subjected to uncertainties. Due to conservative capital spending by upstream players and possibilities of soft fuel demand, production volumes could get dented, hurting demand for partnerships’ midstream assets.Despite the uncertainties, pipeline players are better off than upstream and downstream firms since the partnerships generate stable fee-based revenues from their long-term contracts with shippers. The industry frontrunners include Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI, The Williams Companies Inc WMB and MPLX LP MPLX and Plains GP Holdings, LP PAGP.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry comprises companies that own and operate midstream energy infrastructure assets. The properties consist of extensive pipeline networks that transport crude oil, liquids and natural gas. The midstream energy players are also involved in the processing and storing of natural gas. The companies have interests in natural gas distribution utilities, serving millions of retail customers across North America. Some companies are ramping up investments in renewable energy and power transmission businesses. The firms invested in wind farms, solar energy operations, geothermal projects and hydroelectric facilities. Thus, with a diversified portfolio of renewable energy projects, the firms have room to generate extra cash flows in addition to stable fee-based revenues from the transportation assets.What's Shaping the Future of Oil &amp; Gas - Production and Pipelines Industry?Soft Pipeline Demand: The inflationary environment is probably leading to a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which could hurt fuel demand. The uncertainty in fuel demand is likely to affect the production of the commodity, which in turn will lower the demand for oil pipeline assets of the partnerships.Story continuesLower Fee-Based Revenues: Soft demand for midstream assets might ultimately lead to lower fee-based revenues for the master limited partnerships. Also, to sail through soft demand for pipeline networks, several energy players with midstream presence will likely have no option but to offer discounts to shippers.Shift to Renewables: Energy majors will increasingly face challenges in providing sustainable energy to the world while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, to address the issue of climate change, there will be a gradual shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy. This will lower the demand for the partnerships’ pipeline and storage networks for oil and natural gas.Explorers' Conservative Capital Spending: Oil and gas exploration and production companies are facing heightened pressure from investors to focus on stockholders’ returns rather than production. This is hindering the production growth of commodities, thereby denting pipeline and storage assets.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines is a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #186, which places it in the bottom 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the cloudy prospects, we present a few stocks that investors can retain or keep an eye on, given their solid potential. But before that, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and its current valuation.Industry Lags Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has fallen 3.9% over this period against the 4.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 and a 3.6% improvement of the broader sector.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing oil and gas production &amp; pipeline stocks, the industry is currently trading at 11.99X, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 13.14X. It is, however, above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.01X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.54X, as low as 8.88X and at a median of 12.90X.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio4 Oil &amp; Gas Pipeline Stocks Trying to Survive the Industry ChallengesPlains GP Holdings: Plains GP is a leading midstream energy services provider. Through its extensive pipeline network, Plains GP transports more than 7 million barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids, thereby connecting key market hubs with prolific basins in North America. Over the past seven days, Plains GP, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2023 earnings.Price and Consensus: PAGPMPLX LP: MPLX generates stable cashflows and has lower exposure to commodity price volatility since it is the operator of midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets. It also generates cashflows from a relatively stable fuels distribution business.Over the past 30 days, MPLX has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2023. The partnership, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has attractive organic growth capital projects and is pursuing low-carbon opportunities.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price and Consensus: MPLXKinder Morgan: With its operating interests in oil and gas pipeline networks spread across 83,000 miles, Kinder Morgan is a leading energy infrastructure company in North America. It derives most of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts, generating stable fee-based revenues.Kinder Morgan, with a Zacks Rank of 3, is poised to grow more on the back of its business model, which is relatively resilient to volume and commodity price risks.Price and Consensus: KMIThe Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market.

At the time, the Boeing 767-300 had not been repainted in Air Canada Cargo’s new, permanent livery. (Photo: Air Canada)Air Canada on Friday reported a 24% decline in second-quarter cargo revenue, a performance better than most international peers that was aided by the deployment of four additional Boeing 767-300 freighters during the past year.Canada’s largest passenger airline launched its own cargo airline in early 2022 and now has six cargo jets in the fleet. Two were directly purchased from the Boeing factory and four are former passenger jets converted by a specialty engineering firm to transport shipping containers in the main cabin. The freighters allow Air Canada (TO: AC) to target markets where there is a need for consistent capacity or where seasonal passenger flights might not operate. At the same time, the broader passenger network allows the cargo division to connect to the freighters at key hubs and serve more customers.Cargo revenues declined 24% year over year to $53.7 million (CA$72 million) on a mix of lower volume and lower yield, Air Canada said. One reason for the decline is that Air Canada was still using a handful of passenger aircraft as temporary cargo planes in the trans-Pacific and has since returned them to full passenger operations. The decline was partially offset by increased freighter operations to Central and South America and to Europe.Cargo revenues in the first six months of 2023 declined $232 million or 33% from the same period in 2022.Air Canada set a record of $1.2 billion in cargo revenue in 2021, with a 15% decline in 2022 to $935 million.Air Canada expects to receive one more 767 this year after Israel Aerospace Industries completes the hull conversion. The target is for 10 767 freighters by 2025, with two production freighters from Boeing scheduled to arrive next year.In May, Air Canada Cargo operated its first cargo flight to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and now flies there once per week. It also added a fourth weekly freighter flight on Aug. 5 to Mexico City. Other Latin America destinations include San José, Costa Rica; Bogota, Colombia; Lima, Peru; Guadalajara, Mexico; Quito, Ecuador; and San Juan, Puerto Rico.Story continuesAir Canada recently enabled Emirates SkyCargo customers to electronically book interline cargo shipments to Canada via European gateways and is expanding the direct booking capability on Emirates flights across its global network. The new feature is aimed at shippers in west Asia, the Middle East and Africa and is part of a broader collaboration between the airlines.The entire air logistics sector experienced sharply lower cargo sales and operating profits during the second quarter from 2022, the latest stage in a 16-month slide in shipping demand resulting from slower global economic growth and trade, as well as retailers still working off excess inventories. Several Asian airlines with dual passenger and freighter divisions saw cargo revenues drop more than 50% or 60%. Lufthansa Cargo said its air logistics sales plunged by half during the quarter. Revenue shrank 37% to 40% for the big U.S. carriers and about a third at Air France-KLM and British Airways.Companywide, Air Canada beat expectations with $894 million in earnings before accounting and tax adjustments thanks to strong travel demand and the return of more international flying following pandemic limits.Click here for more FreightWaves and American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.RECOMMENDED READING:Uprooted airlines relocate to secondary airport near Mexico CityLufthansa Cargo profits fall nearly 100% on weak shipping demandAmerican, United Airlines’ cargo revenue smacked down by weak marketThe post New Air Canada freighters help offset declines in cargo revenue appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

And I'm excited to announce that over the past 90 days, some of the largest stakeholders in aviation have publicly joined us in supporting our strategy.First, we're grateful to share multiple points of endorsement from across the United States government. I'm extremely proud to announce that just last week, the Federal Aviation Administration issued our special airworthiness certificate for our first Midnight aircraft, allowing us to begin flying. With this certificate in hand, our team will ramp up both our flight schedules and our fleet size as we work toward our planned 2025 commercial launch. This is a great milestone for Archer, and I'm proud of the teams at both Archer and the FAA, who work tirelessly to ensure our aircraft can begin flying on our desired time line. This announcement comes on the heels of last month's Advanced Air Mobility implementation plan that the FAA published as the culmination of years of collaboration with Archer and other industry leaders. This innovative road map reinforced the government's commitment to U.S. leadership in this sector as well as Archer's expected launch of our commercial service in 2025 by leveraging existing operating rules and infrastructure. Further, the FAA has laid out a plan for making the necessary enhancements of the country's air traffic control systems and operating rules to enable the rising full-scale passenger eVTOL aircraft service by 2028 in time to showcase UAM at the Los Angeles Olympics.The leader who directed and oversaw much of this implementation plan and commitment to the time line for commercial launch by 2025 and full-scale operations by 2028 was no other than the distinguished FAA administrator, Captain Billy Nolen, who announced his decision to leave the FAA to join Archer as our Chief Safety Officer back in June. With over 30 years of experience in safety, regulatory affairs and flight operations as well as senior executive roles at American Airlines and Qantas Airways in addition to his service in the U.S. Army as an airplane and helicopter pilot and safety officer. Billy is the ideal person to guide Archer through the most efficient pathway to FAA certification and commercial deployment.He has long been a strong supporter of the eVTOL aircraft industry, spearheading our countries and the FAA's global leadership role in this important area and his appointment as our Chief Safety Officer underscores our commitment to safety and innovation. Before joining Archer, Billy conducted a thorough assessment of the competitive landscape. You'll hear shortly from Billy about why he chose to come to Archer and his belief in our approach of optimizing our design for certification and focusing on developing only the most critical enabling technology in-house, while also partnering with leading suppliers. With Billy on board, I have already started to see him help us shape the future of transportation and make sustainable, efficient air travel an everyday reality.Second, we are honored that just last week, the U.S. Air Force awarded Archer contracts with the largest contract value of any OEM in the eVTOL industry with a value of up to $142 million. The DoD has made an unprecedented commitment to helping Archer accelerate our technology development. This agreement was made possible through our long-standing partnership with the Department of Defense on a series of projects through the Air Force's AFWERX program, which has been assessing the transformational potential of the vertical flight market and eVTOL technologies for DoD purposes.In this new execution phase of our partnership, Archer will deliver aircraft to the Air Force. They will test these aircraft to support future missions in personnel transport and logistics support, rescue operations and more. These applications of our midnight aircraft, we hope, will not only help save lives, but also accelerate our technology and operational learnings as we build a world-class consumer aircraft and service. Today, we're announcing that we have accelerated our plans and hope to deliver the first aircraft within the next six months as early as Q4 2023. We believe this would be the first eVTOL aircraft in history to be delivered to a paying customer.Given the strength of the team that is working on this at Archer, we anticipate leveraging this contract as a platform for future partnerships with the other branches of the Armed Forces, which would increase the total value of our relationship with the DoD. In fact, just last week, we hosted representatives from the U.S. Marine Corps at Archer headquarters and our flight test facilities to demonstrate the capabilities of our Midnight aircraft. A lot of this was made possible by our recently assembled six-member Government Services Advisory Board, who is critical in helping to build our first step of this partnership with the military. I'm sincerely grateful for the support of the DoD, Captain Nolen, our Government Service Advisory Board members and all of the Archer teammates and veterans for their continued service and support in ensuring the U.S. maintains its leadership position in aviation.Finally, I have long maintained that the eVTOL industry and Archer have been able to move as quickly as we are because of aviation and technology pioneers who for decades, have pushed the envelope on what is possible, collectively transporting millions of people around the world with unparalleled levels associates. Today, I'm excited to announce a strategic relationship with the biggest aerospace giant of the them all, Boeing. Boeing was actually one of the first to fly a fixed-wing VTOL aircraft, the V-22 Osprey, over 30 years ago. And today, I'm excited to call them one of Archer's investors.Our collaboration with Boeing and its subsidiary Wisk will be focused on supporting the integration of Wisk's autonomy technology in future variants of our aircraft. For background, Wisk was cofounded by Google founder, Larry Page, who is an early pioneer of the eVTOL industry and one of the sector's biggest advocates in pushing the development of slate autonomy technology. This collaboration could bring for Archer the potential to access world-leading autonomy technology while substantially reducing the cost of developing it ourselves. As the collaboration matures, we will share further details, but it is important to understand that this puts Archer in a unique position to be able to source autonomy technology from a leader in the industry. This is a natural extension of our overall strategy of focusing our in-house research and development on the key enabling technology that cannot be sourced from the existing aerospace supply base.As part of this new collaboration, Archer, Boeing and Wisk have agreed to settle the litigation between the parties and collectively look to the future. I look forward to working with Boeing and Wisk on the collaboration that looks forward to the growth and development of the AAM industry. But that's not all. As part of the party's collaboration, we are excited to welcome Boeing as an investor in today's $215 million funding round alongside our other long-time strategic partners, Stellantis and United. The deep partnership we are seeing from Stellantis across the business is unrivaled from their continued willingness to provide us the capital we need to accelerate our business to the support and energy CEO, Carlos Tavares and CTO, Ned Curic, brings to the table through their dozens of full-time Stellantis employees working alongside ours as we jointly build out the world's first high-volume eVTOL manufacturing facility in Georgia.We are seeing similar commitment from our partner, United Airlines, who is an integral player in our push towards our goal of achieving commercialization in 2025 as we work to fulfill United's billion dollar order for Archer's Midnight aircraft. The team at United is working with us hand-in-hand in important launch markets such as New York City and Chicago, where United is developing innovative approaches to operating our aircraft within its Newark and O'Hare airport hubs to enable a world-class customer experience door to door. I'm proud to call Boeing, United and Stellantis partners who are not nearly partners in name, but partners who are truly invested in working toward our collective long-term success in eVTOL. Importantly, as part of this financing, we are grateful to have the support of major long-term financial investors such as ARK Invest, who share our long-term outlook for Archer and our role leading the eVTOL industry.As I reflect on these remarkable accomplishments, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our incredible team, partners and shareholders. Together, we are pioneering a new era of aviation, driving innovation and revolutionizing transportation for generations to come.Before I turn it over to Tom, let's take a step back for a second. In the last quarter alone, the United States military and government have both made an unwavering commitment that America will lead the way in commercializing eVTOL. The FAA has validated the time line for both Archer and Jovy to bring our aircraft to market in the U.S. in 2025. And we both proudly hosted more than 70 members of President Biden's AAM Interagency Working Group last month for a private flight test.Additionally, the Department of Defense has committed to nearly $300 million in contract value across the sector, providing incredible momentum for being the first country to bring eVTOL to market. When Midnight takes to the skies in the coming weeks, it will mark a new era in advanced error mobility. Our team's hard work and dedication have brought us to this exciting moment, and we can't wait to see Midnight and our industry store. Thank you for joining us on this thrilling journey, and I look forward to your questions later in the call.I will now hand it over to Tom, who will dive into the technical aspects of our strategy and how those also have begun to bear fruit.Thomas Paul MunizThanks, Adam. This past quarter, we continued to execute our strategy, building momentum across our aircraft development, manufacturing and certification efforts with key progress toward our target of commercial launch in 2025. With each passing quarter and each milestone hit on schedule, we continue to prove our steadfast strategy and execute the most efficient path to market optimizing our aircraft for certification, manufacturing and commercial operations, and it is continuing to pay dividends. I couldn't be more pleased with our team's progress, and I'm excited to share updates with you in each of the key areas supporting our aircraft commercialization.First, on aircraft development. As Adam mentioned earlier, last week, the FAA issued a special airworthiness certificate for our first Midnight aircraft. This is the culmination of an extensive ground testing campaign over the past couple of months as our flight test team has been hard at work, getting the aircraft ready to fly safely. Now that we are certified the fly, we will steadily ramp up both our flight testing regimen and our fleet size and continue to march towards the final stages of our certification program and commercial launch.As we've discussed before, Midnight combines our proprietary electric powertrain and flight control software along with extensive use of mature certified components and systems from some of the best aerospace suppliers in the world. This strategy of focusing on the key enabling technologies allowed us to invest only where it's needed to ensure that our aircraft can achieve the performance required for commercial success, fishing payload, range, fast charge and turnaround times and speed without having to reinvent the wheel for more conventional aircraft components like flight controlled computers, where our supply of partners have the experience, IP, certification data and scale of manufacturing expertise.As part of this broader strategy, we have also made pragmatic commercially focused decisions in how we developed our core technology, which we like to call realistic innovation. Think of this as applying the design for certification, manufacturing and commercialization recursively through our tech stack. For example, our batteries leverage commercial cylindrical cells because we believe they deliver the best safety and reliability available, paving the way for a smoother path to certification, easier scale-up of manufacturing and lower operating costs, translating into lower prices for consumers. We could have instead chosen a more exotic pouch cell for marginal gains in energy density, but the slight increase in performance that may have yielded would have been more than offset by the increased risk in safety, certification, manufacturability and cost. Similarly, for our electric engines, while every aspect of the design was optimized for our aircraft, each part was also optimized for safety, reliability and manufacturability, leveraging proven and scalable manufacturing processes from the automotive industry that will let us ramp up production while maintaining the highest possible quality standards.With the airworthiness certificate now in hand, we expect to begin flying Midnight in the next couple of weeks. This first Midnight aircraft will be flown without a pilot on board as we did for Maker and will be used to gather data for internal design validation and in preparation for the final stage of our certification program. Data gathered from flying this aircraft to prepare us for having FAA pilots fly our aircraft next year and our [for-credit] certification by testing. This flight test data is complemented by extensive for-credit component and system testing gathered in our world-class Tesla facility, which is now online in San Jose. This facility has roughly a dozen custom design labs where we are putting each of the systems on the aircraft through their paces, gathering all of the ground test data needed for certification and high-volume manufacturing readiness.These labs are largely focused on system integration as our strategy of partnering with the best aerospace suppliers in the world means that we benefit from all of their existing component data and test capabilities, limiting the amount of testing and certification work required to get our aircraft certified and ready for mass manufacturing. This facility is also where we are doing the final assembly of our fleet of conforming Midnight aircraft, which will be used for piloted flight testing next year.We are well underway in manufacturing our initial piloted conforming Unite aircraft. Our supplier partners are currently fabricating the primary structure of many system components, leveraging their decades of experience in the aerospace industry. I want to thank all of our suppliers for their partnership and teamwork as we work together to bring Midnight to market. We plan to start the final assembly of the first conforming piloted Midnight aircraft within the next two months at our state-of-the-art San Jose, California manufacturing facility. Over the next year, we plan to build at least six of these aircraft to accelerate our certification flight testing efforts, and we plan to hold our first piloted flight in early 2024.In Georgia, we are rapidly progressing the build-out of our high rate production facility. Our team has cleared and graded our roughly 100-acre site in preparation for imminently pouring the foundation and the broader construction efforts remain on track to enable occupying factory next year so that we can initiate our production ramp to produce deployment-ready aircraft for 2025. I am sincerely grateful to our government partners across the state from Newton County, the City of Covington and the Georgia DOT as well as our construction partners for their incredible support.On the certification front, we are progressively building momentum. I'm happy to report that the FAA has begun accepting our certification plans. As a reminder of where we are in the process, our teams are working closely with the FAA on our detailed certification plans, which detail exactly how our design complies with the airworthiness criteria set out in our certification basis. To give this more context, our certification plans are what allowed the team to move forward with generating for-credit test and analysis data for the FAA to use to validate and certify our aircraft.As I mentioned earlier, a key part of our strategy is that we have leveraged an extensive group of partners to supply components and bring our aircraft to market as efficiently as possible. That strategy has yielded a significantly similar and more focused scope of certification work to do in the implementation phase of the certification program, meaning post development of our certification plans. Then if we had chosen to reinvent the wheel on all the core components and systems on the aircraft. This intentional strategy has allowed the team to advance rapidly through our certification program to date, and it is why I believe that we will take the lead over the next 12 months in the race to bring the first commercial eVTOL aircraft to market here in the U.S.Needless to say, our strategy is paying off. Much of that is due to the hard work of the Administrator Nolen and the work he and his team did at the FAA before he joined us, collaborating with industry on the right framework to certify eVTOL aircraft. I'm excited to pass it over the Billy to share his unique perspective on the exciting plan for Archer and the industry.Brett AdcockThanks, Tom. I'm very excited to be part of the team here at Archer, which I have over the last several years come to believe will become the unambiguous leader among eVTOL manufacturers. During my time at the FAA, I led and oversaw the build-out of the first Advanced Air Mobility framework, which Adam spoke to earlier, with the understanding that the U.S. needs to move fast and with strong intent to maintain our leadership position in aviation and technology that will fundamentally transform the way we move between and within Americas City.As a fortune function in this effort, I decided to choose the Los Angeles Summer Olympics in July 2028 as a target date for when the U.S. needs to have built out scaled urban air mobility networks across our largest, most congested American cities. My team originally felt that goal was ambitious. But over the last year, it became clear that the leaders in the eVTOL industry were well positioned to be at real scale by 2028, contingent on the continued strong support that the FAA and the whole of U.S. government had pledged.Working backwards from scaled operations in multiple U.S. cities by 2028, my team at the FAA is further committed to enabling the leaders, including Archer to certify and commercially launch their aircraft by early 2025 in order to start moving people in and around cities while showing the world the power of American innovation when catalyzed by a supportive regulatory environment.In line with this, the Innovate 28 plan that the FAA published last month explicitly notes that the agency is putting in place a plan to be ready by 2025 for initial operations in concert with industry. The plan goes on to provide significantly greater detail in this framework to certify, train and integrate eVTOLs and eVTOL operators safely into the National Airspace by leveraging existing operating rules and aviation infrastructure while enabling future upgrades to enable continued growth across the industry. On the certification front, we're well on our way. Having received our certification basis from the FAA in 2021, we are now working to finalize our means of compliance with the FAA airworthiness criteria prior to beginning for credit testing, which we expect to commence in early 2024.On training, in June, the FAA issued its proposed SVFR on eVTOL pilot training requirements and operational rules, providing a clear pathway for pilots to earn power lift ratings specific to each type of aircraft they fly. Archer is working with the leading eVTOL OEM along with the General Aviation Manufacturing Association to collectively provide industry input to the FAA over the next week.And finally, with regard to airspace integration, the FAA has released a thoughtful blueprint that covers air traffic routes, pilot communication, the use of the existing Heliport infrastructure and the build-out of new vertical infrastructure, leveraging public private partnerships. Archer has already made substantial progress on infrastructure readiness and establishing partnerships with state and local government with the announcement of its planned route in New York and Chicago in partnership with United Airlines, and we're taking a databased approach toward establishing the most efficient operational footprint.It is clear that the DOT and the FAA have dramatically accelerated the pace of activity to further advance their mobility over the past few months, and we applaud them for appropriately making AAM a top priority within the administration. More importantly, we are grateful to the administration for taking the whole of government approach to ensure the resources are in place for a safe ramp-up of the industry in the period from 2025 through 2028 by publicly committing to enable the industry to deliver on this time line. The administration is signaling that they have provided the incentives and resources to execute this ambitious plan. In doing so, they will undoubtedly position the U.S. at the forefront of a new global industry.I've been pleased with the continued collaboration between the FAA and companies like Archer, especially since my departure. And I'm very excited to now be working with the Archer team as we approach the final stage of our path to commercialization.With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to give you a financial overview.Mark MeslerThanks, Billy. I'm excited about the progress our team has made on a number of fronts as we continue executing our strategy to create the most efficient path to market, both financially and operationally. The equity financing, we just announced will help accelerate that strategy, but I want to share more information about the participants and how we plan to use those proceeds.In our 2021 public offering, we raised substantial capital to develop our Midnight aircraft and get to commercialization. Over the last two years, as we have continued to hit our milestones, we've been grateful to see outsized interest from important strategic and financial partners who want to be a part of the Archer story. So, we decided to create an opportunity for them to participate and also further enhance our liquidity. As Adam mentioned, today's equity investment round of $215 million was led by Stellantis with $70 million as part of their previous commitment that they decided to accelerate and pull forward into this equity route. Our long-time partner, United Airlines, invested another $25 million into this round joined by our new partner, Boeing, as Adam detailed earlier.ARK Invest, one of the leading investors in disruptive technologies also invested another $44 million. High-quality financial investors who share the long-term outlook as Archer and our partners [fill] the balance of the round. This investment, combined with the remaining Stellantis commitment to $55 million, brings our total liquidity to over $635 million and brings our aggregate funding to $1.1 billion to date. The funds raised will be used for the continued development of Midnight and related technology, the build-out of our manufacturing and test facilities, working capital and general corporate purposes.Beyond the capital that this fund rate provides, we're proud of the outsized participation from our core partners, Stellantis and United, who have continued to support Archer financially and operationally over the years. When we expanded our partnership with Stellantis earlier this year, they pledged to invest a [pill] of $150 million of capital into Archer. As part of structuring that agreement, we worked jointly with the Stellantis team to develop a creative forward equity purchase framework that allows Archer to call that capital over time at our discretion, subject to certain business milestones instead of taking on significant dilution then at a lower share price.Our wins over the last several months and the performance of our stock price have made it an opportune time to draw down the initial $25 million tranche in June and on the $70 million tranche as part of this financing. In Q2, Coatis also purchased 4.9 million shares of Archer's stock in the open market to deepen our partnership even further. Beyond the financial support, Stellantis continues to be a great operating partner. They were key in helping us identify our Covington, Georgia factory site out of hundreds of potential options across the U.S. due to its apparent proximate location and generous financial package from the state and local municipalities. Stellantis has helped us resolve numerous supply chain issues, and there are now dozens of full-time Stellantis employees working on site at Archer to help us as we continue ramping up our manufacturing operations. Stellantis? commitment to pushing the bounties on the future of mobility and Archer's role in it is second to none.In a similar vein, United support has been unrivaled in our industry. As you'll remember, coupled with their initial investment in Archer, United agreed to purchase up to 300 aircraft from us that they planned to deploy across American cities with a focus on their important hubs. Just last August, they provided a $10 million predelivery payment against the first 100 aircraft, which is an important sign of conviction that we have not always seen in deals of this nature across the industry. Together with United, we have announced our first two commercial eVTOL routes that we plan to operate together, including United hubs at Newark serving New York City and O'Hare serving Chicago. We are very proud and fortunate to have the support of these two world-class partners who are now joined by Boeing as we collaborate with them on our autonomous flight.Now let's switch to our financial performance for Q2. Our non-GAAP total operating expenses was $77.4 million. We landed towards lower end of our estimate range of $75 million to $85 million. This led to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $76.3 million. Our operating expenses continue to be primarily driven by investments in headcount, aircraft parts and materials and tooling and other nonrecurring supplier costs. With respect to our GAAP financials, the impact of our agreements with Boeing and Wisk and the issuance of new warrants resulted in noncash charges to our P&amp;L, which I will outline in our GAAP financials.On a GAAP basis, total operating expenses for Q2 2023 were $181.4 million, which included $104 million of noncash charges. These noncash charges were comprised of $25 million for the vested portion of warrants provided in support of the Boeing Wisk agreements I just discussed, $48 million for the unvested portion that is subject to certain investment criteria and may never be realized for those agreements, $26.5 million of our standard stock-based compensation expenses and $4.5 million of [warrant] expenses for our (inaudible) Stellantis. This drove a net loss of $184.1 million.We finished the quarter with $407.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on our balance sheet. Our net change in cash in Q2 2023 was $42.3 million, including the $25 million drawn in June from the Stellantis funding agreement. This cash was primarily used to fund non-GAAP operating expenses and CapEx.As I discussed on prior calls, in 2023, Archer is making some nonrecurring investments alongside key suppliers to support the development and manufacturing setup of many of our Midnight components. This spending is also consistent with our overall strategy of creating the most efficient path to market where we're focused on investing and hiring to for our key differentiating technologies and leveraging the existing aerospace industry supply base for the rest. That framework allows us to avoid the ongoing structural spending of headcount to develop those other individual technologies and execute a lower operating cost development model while derisking our certification efforts and accelerating our time to market if we would have had to develop those technologies internally.Given that, in Q2, of the $77.4 million in non-GAAP operating expenses, the amount of nonrecurring engineering and other investments was $12 million. Our overall spending framework for 2023 is similar, made up of our core operating expenses, nonrecurring costs to establish our supply base and CapEx. Nonrecurring costs for Q1 2023 and Q2 2023 or $16 million and $12 million, respectively. These nonrecurring costs will not be a material part of our expense structure in 2024 and beyond as we will have completed most of that work this year.Backing those amounts out of our current expense structure, we have core operating expenses of $61.5 million and $65.5 million, respectively, for Q1 2023 and Q2 2023. That level of current spending is our standard core structural spending that will persist into the future, and the nonrecurring costs will not persist materially beyond 2023.I wanted to make this differentiation to share how our overarching strategy impacts our spending profile. Our June ending cash balance of $407.6 million, combined with the capital that we raised today and the remaining $55 million from the Stellantis equity option previously discussed provides us with more than $675 million of liquidity to get to commercialization in 2025. In addition to this liquidity, we do see other opportunities for non-dilutive cash receipts in the form of predelivery payments from United and potential other future orders and spending offset from the DoD contract that we announced last week.Finally, for Q3 2023, we anticipate a total GAAP operating expense of $42 million to $52 million. This was lower than our historical spending due to a onetime noncash benefit of $58 million as a result of reversal of an unrealized expense relating to the founder grants, offset by expected stock-based compensation and warrant expense of approximately $25 million. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for Q3 2023 is anticipated to be $75 million to $85 million.And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions.] Our first question comes from Edison Yu with Deutsche Bank.Edison YuCongratulations. You guys have certainly been very busy. So, starting off, could you maybe talk about the role Boeing will have or could have going forward? Obviously, there was a pretty contentious lawsuit going on and it's been settled, what kind of role do you envision them having going forward?Adam D. GoldsteinThanks for the question, Edison. This is Adam. So first, I am thrilled to have the Boeing company investment and to be working with them and Wisk on autonomy. So, Boeing support, I think, really can only help just further the growth and development of the entire AAM industry. But if I think about the relationship here, this is multifaceted. And so, there's a number of components here that went into this. One is Boeing's investment and our latest financing round to the collaboration agreement between the parties where we will work with Boeing and Wisk on autonomy for future versions, the Midnight aircraft. Three, there were warrants provided to Boeing and Wisk and, four, the settlement of all the litigation between the parties. So, probably that puts it in perspective here, but we are really excited to work with Boeing and Wisk on these future autonomy programs.Edison YuAnd following up on the DoD opportunity, I know you landed one with the Air Force already and you mentioned that the Marines visited last week. Do you have a sense of how big that opportunity can be going forward? Not trying to pin you down to any number, but it sounds as if there is quite a bit of upside. I'm curious how do you think about that growing?Adam D. GoldsteinYes. No, I totally agree with you, Edison. The contract value itself, right, there's a stated number in there, which I think is really exciting, and it's the largest contract that we've seen in the industry. But it really is the -- I would think the bigger value here is really the opportunities that go beyond that. So, we now have a chance to showcase the vehicle and capabilities to all the different branches of the Armed Services, which really opens us up to broader applications. And then there's also global applications of that as well. This also provides like another channel for us to sell into outside of the FAA-led civilian side. So, it really does provide a nice diversification of revenue and allows us to be able to get to market sooner than the -- than just purely on the civilian side.Edison YuGot it. And if I could just sneak one in for Billy. I know you mentioned you kind of evaluated the entire competitive landscape. You have a very bold vision. How do you sort of see the ramp of the eVTOL industry from 2025 to 2028? Is it -- are we talking hundreds, thousands of aircraft across cities, what's the UAM sort of look like in your view by that date?Brett AdcockYes, thanks for the question. If you think back to the whole premise of Innovate 28, it was indeed getting to that 2025. So, we're probably talking multiples of 10, 20 aircraft in that 2025 time frame and then really scaling up from there. My estimation from my time sitting in an administrators chair was that we could certainly be into the hundreds of eVTOLs the time we get to 2028, if not in the thousands there. So, we'd see that as this take often as the market demand, which we're seeing globally is kind of what we are projecting, which is why we really wanted to have the strong framework in place.OperatorOur next question comes from Andres Sheppard with Cantor Fitzgerald.Andres Juan Sheppard-SlingerCongrats on the quarter. Congrats on all the recent announcements. Maybe a first question for Mark. Would you mind just walking us through again, that $215 million investment? So, the $70 million investment from Stellantis, is that in addition to the prior $150 million or that's part of that agreement? And then I think you broke it down further $25 million from United. Just trying to reconcile the total amount, Mark, if you don't mind.Mark MeslerYes, sure. So, a couple of points there, Andres, one -- yes, that was an acceleration of the $70 million from the prior a $150 million commitment as we got momentum around the DoD contract and some of the more recent announcements, they were anxious to get in with this round. We've only currently publicly disclosed those four investors, United at 25, Stellantis at 70% and ARK at 44 and the others are -- we haven't disclosed for the full $215 million.Andres Juan Sheppard-SlingerOkay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe a question for Adam. Adam, in your CMC interview prior to the earnings call, you alluded as to where you see the industry moving forward in maybe the later years as it pertains to autonomy. I think you went in so far to say you expect autonomy to maybe take a leading role later in the industry. I'm just wondering maybe you can expand on what you meant there and how you see now the collaboration with Wisk integrating and maybe some sort of time line that you might be able to give us?Adam D. GoldsteinYes. So, Archer's strategy has always been to find the most efficient path to market. And in doing that, we started by having a piloted vehicle. And so that's where the existing roles are. We can enter into service here in the very near future. And so, we're really excited about that. As the industry scales, though and really goes beyond where you start to have thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of vehicles, the need for autonomy really helps increase a lot of value to the industry, one because there's a less need for pilots. But two, there's an increased potential for safety. And so, I think that really is a big deal. So, I guess, and the third one here is cost. You can also reduce cost by doing that. So as the industry scales, there's an ability to add this capability.Now for us, why this is so interesting, if you think back to our strategy, our strategy has been to partner with the best groups that can help us get to market. So, we partnered with the Tier 1 suppliers like Honeywell and Safran and Garmin. And this has really helped us get this -- to help us find our efficient path to market. But then we look to the future, and we start thinking about future variance in the vehicle and developing autonomy can be obviously a very expensive path, especially because the date of launching the services is also harder to predict. So, this is a good way for us to leverage and work with the group that probably has the most experience in the world in flight autonomy and allows us to keep going down a path of having piloted vehicles come to market early and then have an application on the ability to test these vehicles with autonomy and ultimately scale as the technology becomes available.Andres Juan Sheppard-SlingerGot it. That's super helpful and super insightful. Maybe if I could just squeeze one last one. Related to the Air Force and the DoD contract, you've quantified the worth of the contract so far. But I guess I'm wondering, do you see the -- do you expect the military to maybe open these programs of records for eVTOL and in doing so, maybe open up a new market? I mean there's opportunities here for growth within that contract, I would imagine. So just kind of curious how you're thinking about that -- that partnership over the medium to longer term.Adam D. GoldsteinYes. I mean I believe that this contract is really just the start for the industry and will really evolve into a very sizable relationship with the U.S. military. Since we announced our first contract with AFWERX, we've seen outsized interest from pretty much every branch in the armed forces. And as we mentioned, we hosted the Marine Corps last week and our -- one of the members of our government advisory board, 4 star General Townsend has been working with us to help crack the code on how to work with the U.S. Army, which has the largest [aircraft] fleet in the world. So, I do believe there is a very real potential for the eVTOL industry to move into a multi-hundred million dollar or even $1 billion programs of record with the DoD over time.Andres Juan Sheppard-SlingerWonderful. Congrats again on the quarter. I'll pass it on.OperatorOur next question comes from [Savi] Syth with Raymond James.Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-SythIf I may just follow up on Andre's question just before. With these investments, are you -- have you shared like at the price point that they're being made or if there's any warrants associated with them?Mark MeslerIn the 8-K, it discloses the pricing of this. If we look at recent financing activity, some of our peers have priced at a 20% discount we've observed with our bankers, other public fall on rounds, pricing at an average of 8% to 8.5% discount. Our round was actually oversubscribed. And we had a caller structure around it where we priced ours at roughly a 5% discount, which are better terms than other deals getting done today.Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-SythThat's helpful. Sorry, I missed that. And then just on the certification conforming aircraft and building that, are there anything that you need from the FAA in terms of accepting various certification plans that you've submitted or clarifying kind of on rulemaking that's needed before you can start that? Or is it really a matter of just kind of getting production set up and moving forward?Thomas Paul MunizSo maybe to give you a little context there, our whole strategy around certification was to keep things as simple and easy as possible. And that's like why we took this approach of partnering with existing aerospace suppliers wherever we could to leverage their existing certification data capabilities, etc. But then on our own path towards getting the TC, the big thing that we've been working through over the past six months is what you're asking about getting those cert plans finalized. The most important thing there is not necessarily checking the box, but the cert plans accepted, but more what's the content of those plans and what the scope of testing? So, to get at your question, specifically, what do we need to move forward, once we have those or plans agreed, then it's a matter of just executing the steps laid out in those plans, doing the test, doing the analysis to get our TC, specifically around conformity, each of those cert plans, which are very self-contained. Those give the specific details of what's delegated, what's going to be conformed to what standard to do what tests and then it's purely an execution game.So again, because of the strategy we took, we feel very optimistic that we're going to have a very smooth path and you'll really see us start accelerating here over the rest of the year into next year because we've laid for this, let's say, relatively simple path to go and execute. Hopefully, that's helpful context.Savanthi Nipunika Prelis-SythThat's super helpful. And just a clarification, have you submitted all the cert plans? Or is that like in our process? So, kind of where are you in the submission part of it?Thomas Paul MunizYes. Great question. So, we've submitted the majority of our certification plans. There's a couple of remaining that we haven't submitted. Those are in less, let's say, critical areas, things that -- things like noise, which we don't expect to be a driver on the overall schedule. We also have started to get our cert plans formally accepted. So first one was accepted a couple of weeks ago, and there are several others in the queue that we expect to be accepted soon. So, we're really starting to build momentum and very happy with the progress.OperatorOur next question comes from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.William Chapman PetersonNice to see all these announcements here. I wanted to talk first about the DoD contract and maybe some clarifications around that first within that. So, the delivery for maybe end of this year early next year, is that one of the conforming aircraft, or is that something different? And then I think Mark might have said something like this might be like OpEx offsets for some of these early aircraft. And I believe you also -- with the value of the contract, I'm guessing there's the maintenance and repair. So, I guess, how should we roll that through a model? And what's the timing for this -- I guess, for the entirety of the first announcement, how many years and so forth?Mark MeslerSo, the contract is a multifaceted contract. It spans service, it spans, training and it spans hardware and expands some development work internally as well. So, it's going to be a combination of sort of cost reimbursement as well as revenue. I think as we sit here today, that's still coming together in terms of the timing of how that's going to play out. We think a preponderance of the development work will happen over the next -- prior to certification. But I think the timing of everything we haven't discussed. So more to come as we work through that with the DoD.William Chapman PetersonAnd is one of these aircraft conforming aircraft? Or is it an additional aircraft?Thomas Paul MunizSo, the first aircraft we'll be delivering is a nonconforming unit that will be used for early operational testing, but then there are also deliveries of piloted conforming aircraft next year and beyond.William Chapman PetersonOkay. That's helpful. I don't know if this is for Billy or for Adam, but we hear the FAA is proposing reserve requirements for power lift aircraft being consistent with larger aircraft, 30 minutes daytime, 45 minutes at night. I just wanted to make sure if that's really the case. And are these requirements built into the certification plan for Archer?Adam D. GoldsteinYes. I'll chime in first and then let Billy give his thoughts, but you're talking about the reserve requirements that came out in the draft SVFR that the FAA published a couple of months ago. So just help give everybody context here. That's the first draft, right? And the way the process works is that the FAA kind of works amongst themselves without input from industry exparte, rulemaking, and then they publish initial thoughts. And so, over the last couple of months, we've been working with others in the industry to share our perspective on what the right kind of balanced approach looks like to get these rules in a state that obviously supports the required safety but also efficient operations of the aircraft. So, the public comment period on this draft is closing in the next week or so. So, we'll be commenting along with all of our peers as well as our industry associations, GAMA and (inaudible 51.58) etc. We think it's most likely we'll end up with more performance-based reserve requirements similar to what YASAs published rather than a generic VFR endurance kind of number. But we have obviously looked at what our go-to-market path would be if the draft rules kind of stayed as they were. And even in that scenario, I'm happy to say we'd still be very comfortable with being able to operate all the missions we're targeting in cities. So yes, Billy, anything else you want to add?Brett AdcockYes, thanks, Tom. Just to build upon what Tom was just saying. So clearly, during my time, the FAA always wants to hear from the industry, they're limited in the most early part of rulemaking from having what they call exparte communication, as you're probably well aware, right? So, this, as Tom spoke to, the comment period is closing. We've certainly assembled our comments, and we're joining the rest of the industry in getting there. So, we believe at the end of the day, we will find a middle ground that works. But again, as Tom spoke to, we are prepared either way. But we're certainly -- have a strong position that we will convey to the FAA.William Chapman PetersonIf I could sneak one more, too. So, this Innovate 28, and I'm sure that's something you probably are aware of when you were there, Billy, but the document talks about the OEMs, operators, governments, obviously, a lot of local buy-ins for infrastructure. So -- what is the latest thinking around infrastructure, especially with buying from the public on new sites. So, I mean, is this -- try to think, is this a risk to the new sites coming online? How should we think about the infrastructure as we look towards 2028?Brett AdcockYes. Good question. When we think about infrastructure, so that was exactly why you want to have a forcing function like Innovate 28, which gives the time for all of the stakeholders, right? So, we have the infrastructure in place today that can accommodate as things kick off in 2025. Everything is in place, low-density using current helicopter routes using the current [APC] infrastructure. As we scale up, we'll see the equipment that we will commit to on Archer's side, and we've also heard from the FAA in terms of how they will ensure that they can accommodate within the national air space.At the same time, as the FA is having conversations at the state and local levels, so is Archer. We're meeting with stakeholders across the country to make sure when we think about vertiports when we think about current infrastructure that not only can it accommodate us, but we're prepared to be at scale as we move into the future as well.OperatorOur next question comes from David Zazula with Barclays.David Michael ZazulaFirst one is for Billy. Just I think you talked about what you see the industry going forward. Can you maybe take us backwards and just compare what you expected the AAM process going into it with how it actually ended up? What surprised you about it? And maybe if applicable, how that contributed to you choosing to come to Archer.Brett AdcockYes. So, if I go back, the FAA had a lot of these parts were already in place. What I feel that I brought to it, right, was that idea of having a forcing function, that is to have something that you could really coalesce around a -- so this really was the genesis of 2028. If you ask what has surprised me, it really comes as no surprise at all. The FAA has got a great group of professionals and their ability to come together. But more importantly, what I would say on behalf of all of us here in Archer internally, I know Adam has already restated it. We just extended the note of thanks to the administration for pulling together this really hold of government an approach because we know that's what it's going to take. We are certainly prepared to do our part, but we know it takes us, the government and at the state and local level, all working together to make sure this happens. Great.David Michael ZazulaAnd then for Andy or Adam, is there any other color you can give us on the agreement with Wisk and Boeing specifically on the ability to use the autonomous technology. Is that something you can implement in the next generation of aircraft if it is in fact not an autonomous aircraft? Or do you need to kind of go full all-in on autonomy to be able to use this technology?Adam D. GoldsteinYes, David, it's Adam. Maybe I can give you a sort of a high-level answer here. Archer has a lot of success working with strategic partners, and you can see that with our work with United, or work with Stellantis. And so, we start off finding ways to work together and then really growing the relationship from there. So, we are bringing to market a piloted vehicle, and Boeing and Wisk have spent a lot of time, a lot of years, a lot of money doing autonomy. So, there's this natural overlap. And at this stage, we are working together through that to see how to best implement this. And we will certainly provide you with more details and updates as that relationship matures.OperatorOur next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company.Joshua Ward SullivanCongratulations on a number of fronts here. I know you're still working on cert plans. But with the six conforming aircraft assumption for certification, do you have an assumption on the number of credit hours each aircraft is going to need to execute to get to certification at this point?Thomas Paul MunizGreat question. So, we do have a very detailed flight test schedule that goes to each of those specific tail numbers and assign the exact tests that we're going to do. I don't recall the exact number of flat hours off the cuff here, but all of that is like very methodically planned out in advance. And you really have to do it that way and make sure that each aircraft has the proper systems installed properly conformed as we were talking about earlier on the call so that you can get credit for the testing.Joshua Ward SullivanGot it. And then as far as the collaboration with Boeing, when autonomous flight comes to commercial markets, up for debate, but how are your defense relationships looking at that partnership? Is that a faster avenue, especially now you're going to deliver an aircraft this year? And I guess what additional development would you need for Midnight today on the defense side for autonomous operations? Just curious how that might develop.Thomas Paul MunizYes. That's a really interesting question, Josh. I don't have much more color that I can add. I do agree with you that there's lots of avenues and applications here that are interesting, and we're definitely exploring all of those. But I think I would say stay tuned on that one, and we'll give you more updates as those start to come about.Joshua Ward SullivanGot it. And then just one last one. Anything precluding an international defense relationship with the Midnight at this point?Thomas Paul MunizI don't believe so. I mean, I think the high-level rules, the way people talk about it is anywhere the U.S. government sells to the differentiated players can sell to. So that's a pretty broad list.OperatorThank you for your questions. There are no questions waiting in queue at this time. So, I will conclude the conference call at this time. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Dadswell: Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As you know, I assumed the role of Illumina's interim CEO two months ago. Our search for a CEO is underway, and we look forward to updating you soon. Our Board is pleased with the outstanding candidates they are seeing. Before going into our second quarter results, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our former CEO, Francis deSouza, and our former Chairman of the Board, John Thompson, for their thoughtfulness and commitment while at Illumina. I would also like to welcome our new Board members, Stephen MacMillan, our new Chairman of the Board, as well as Andrew Teno and Scott Ullem. I also wanted to acknowledge changes in our executive leadership team, including the departures of our Chief Technology Officer, Alex Aravanis, and our Chief Medical Officer, Phil Febbo. I speak for the whole company in wishing both of them every success in the future. We also are pleased to announce that Steve Barnard, a 25-year Illumina employee and distinguished scientist in our field, will drive Illumina's legacy of innovation forward as our next Chief Technology Officer. We will be conducting a search for our next Chief Medical Officer. Turning to our second quarter results: In Q2, Illumina delivered revenue of approximately $1.18 billion and diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.32, both ahead of the guidance we provided in Q1. We shipped 109 NovaSeq X instruments in the quarter and have increased our expectations for our full year supply capacity to more than 390 instruments. However, as you saw from our earnings release, we are reducing our guidance, and now expect core Illumina full year 2023 revenue to be approximately flat with 2022, primarily as a result of three factors. First, a larger-than-expected temporary decline in high throughput consumables as we transition more-than-expected customers to the NovaSeq X. Second, many of our customers are remaining more cautious in their purchasing behaviors. And finally, in China, there is both a more protracted economic recovery and an increasingly challenged competitive landscape, in contrast to the Americas and Europe, where we are still expecting year-over-year growth in 2023. Joydeep will provide additional details on our revised guidance during his remarks. One area I'd like to touch on further is the rollout of NovaSeq X. This has been a more challenging process than we anticipated. NovaSeq X is the most sophisticated platform we have ever launched and includes the most comprehensive end-to-end software we have ever released. Also, the rollout of the X has occurred at an unprecedented magnitude and pace. And we have identified issues in the field that are typical in new product releases. To address these issues, we have taken actions including a planned software update that was released in June after our first customer shipment in March. We have deployed Illumina technical teams worldwide to work with our customers to accelerate bringing their systems online. While the rollout of NovaSeq X will take longer than we originally expected, the continued strong interest and commitment of capital to purchase NovaSeq Xs remains encouraging. To date, 20% of customers who have purchased a NovaSeq X have ordered more than one instrument. This early demand for multiple instruments and the capacity they represent underscores our confidence that customers are planning to increase their sequencing activity. Customers have clear intentions to do more sequencing in the future: Our customers have commented that larger scale single cell and spatial analysis experiments become more practical with the NovaSeq X, and they are requesting funding for these applications. Customers engaged in large population genomics initiatives have stated they plan to run additional multiomic programs for population-specific variants, which can be used to develop treatments for various demographics that will be more effective in those populations. And, as some of you have heard, several of our largest customers are using the X to accelerate the move from targeted panels and exomes to whole genome sequencing. We expect these types of projects to scale and ramp in the near future, and we will be closely engaged with our customers to support their needs. We continue to consciously and actively reduce our expense base and have accelerated actions within the $100 million-plus annual run rate expense reduction program we announced at our last earnings call. As you saw in our late June 8K filing, we have reduced our global headcount and are downsizing our global real estate footprint. We also are optimizing our third-party vendor spend and have reduced travel-related and other costs. For 2023, these steps are helping mitigate the impact of lower full-year revenue on our operating margin. Looking forward, these actions will continue to support our margins and create flexibility for further investment in high-growth areas. Let me give you an update on a couple of our platforms: We saw continued global interest in the NovaSeq X series in Q2, and we exited the quarter with more than 260 orders since launch. Our shipments of 109 NovaSeq X instruments in Q2 were above our expectation of 80 for the quarter and brought our total installed base to 176 instruments. We now expect to be able to ship more than 390 NovaSeq X instruments this year, up from the 330 we had previously expected for the year. In mid-throughput, we shipped approximately 160 NextSeq 1k/2k units in the second quarter, an increase of 8% year-over- year, as customers expanded their current fleets or migrated from the MiSeq or NextSeq 550. More than 20% of NextSeq 1k/2k units in Q2 were placed with new-to-Illumina customers. We continue to experience lengthened sales cycles, in some cases as customers take time to raise funding or prioritize their investment dollars, and in other cases as they run longer procurement processes. Our win rate across the midthroughput segment, outside of China, increased from the first quarter. We believe there is a long runway of differentiation for the 1k/2k, notably with X-LEAP SBS chemistry coming available on these instruments next year. Moving to our markets. In Q2, clinical represented approximately 53% of our total sequencing consumables revenue. In oncology, progress continued for next generation sequencing-based testing reimbursement. Anthem, the second largest commercial payer in the US, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, both added coverage for comprehensive genomic profiling for patients with advanced cancers, adding more than 30 million additional covered lives. We also saw coverage continue to progress in Europe, with Switzerland now reimbursing large next generation sequencing panels, including comprehensive genomic profiling. Illumina's market leading TruSight Oncology assay, TSO 500, remains on track to exceed more than $100 million in 2023 revenue. Growth continues to be driven by greater utilization and broader adoption of our assay. In Q2, we also completed our TSO Comprehensive submission for IVD registration in the United States. Also in oncology, GRAIL continues to achieve solid progress in the adoption of its Galleri multi-cancer early detection test. In Q2, GRAIL achieved its 100,000th commercial Galleri test milestone, and the test has now been prescribed by more than 7,500 providers in the US and ordered in more than 80 health systems. As an update, on the NHS-Galleri study, in Q2 GRAIL completed second-year follow up visits, in which 130,000 participants returned, giving the trial a retention rate of 91.3%. Invitations for the third and final-year visits have begun, and the first appointments for those visits are expected this fall. Evidence for Galleri continues to grow. At the most recent annual meeting held by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, GRAIL announced results from the University of Oxford-sponsored SYMPLIFY study, reporting high specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of the cancer signal detected and cancer signal origin prediction, as well as demonstrating the feasibility of using an MCED test to assist clinicians with decisions regarding referrals from primary care physicians. GRAIL is also making progress on its unique multi-cancer minimal residual disease test. At the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, GRAIL and AstraZeneca presented new data that supports use of GRAIL's methylation platform to identify residual cancer in post-treatment settings. GRAIL's technology had a cancer detection rate of 92% in patients with relapsed or refractory disease across six hematological malignancies. These findings demonstrate that GRAIL's blood-based methylation approach offers additional options to clinicians as they evaluate patients in efforts to achieve remission and improve survival. Returning to core Illumina, in reproductive health, in the US, five state Medicaid programs – in Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Tennessee – updated their policies and are now covering non-invasive prenatal testing for all pregnancies. In Europe, NIPT is now available for all pregnancies in the Netherlands and has been approved for broader coverage in Italy. Turning to our research and applied markets, as we announced in mid-July, the Alliance for Genomic Discovery, launched by Illumina and Nashville Biosciences in 2022, now includes five founding members – AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, and Merck – and represents a novel, industry-led collaboration to accelerate development of therapeutics through large-scale genomics. Members will co-fund the whole-genome sequencing of 250,000 samples and all have access to the resulting data for use in drug discovery and therapeutic development. The first phase in the Alliance was announced in January and involved whole-genome sequencing for 35,000 samples, primarily made up of DNA from individuals of African ancestry. Before we move to Joydeep and then go to Q&amp;A, I wanted to point out a couple of additional innovations we recently announced. In June, our PrimateAI-3D, an AI algorithm that predicts disease-causing genetic mutations in patients with unprecedented accuracy, was featured in articles and as the cover story of Science magazine's June issue. And in July, we announced the latest version of our DRAGEN software for analysis of next-generation sequencing data. DRAGEN 4.2 expands award-winning accuracy combined with flexibility and scalability to enable efficient workflows and extract meaningful insights from genomic data. It improves identification of the causes of genetic disease and further aids in both drug discovery and population genomics analysis. While the year hasn't progressed the way we expected, we remain focused on execution, innovation, and supporting our customers as they ramp their NovaSeq X instruments. We continue to progress on margin improvement while prioritizing investment in proprietary technology that generates differentiated products that are valued by our customers and will drive growth. These include upcoming product launches, including the highly anticipated 25B flow cell for the NovaSeq X, the Illumina Complete Long Reads enrichment assay, and XLEAP-SBS chemistry on NextSeq 1k/2k, as well as future offerings for emerging markets like proteomics, multiomics, and spatial, where we see opportunities to address researchers' needs and deliver complete, integrated, and accessible workflows. In short, Illumina will continue to deliver impactful outcomes. We empower researchers and clinicians with the data and technology they need to make life-changing discoveries and decisions for patients. Our employees take pride in being part of Illumina's mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. And we are the global engine of genomics innovation, positioning us today and in the future to maximize shareholder value. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Joydeep to discuss additional details on our results and outlook, and we'll go from there to Q&amp;A. Joydeep? Joydeep Goswami: Thank you, Chuck. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. As Chuck noted, in the second quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.18 billion, up 8% from the first quarter of 2023 and exceeding the high end of our guidance range on stronger than expected shipments of NovaSeq X. Consolidated revenue was up 1% year-over-year, and up 3% on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $50 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, which includes dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $164 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations primarily due to continued execution of expense reduction initiatives, gross margin favorability, and our higher revenue for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 39.3% for the quarter, which increased from 25.8% in Q2 2022, with both quarters reflecting the impact of R&amp;D capitalization requirements. Although the non-GAAP tax expense impact of R&amp;D capitalization requirements in dollars was the same in both periods, the impact to our effective tax rate in Q2 2023 was more significant due to our lower earnings. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million. Moving to segment results. Core Illumina revenue of $1.16 billion was approximately flat year-over-year, or up 2% on a constant currency basis, which included an anticipated reduction from COVID surveillance of approximately 180 basis points. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $6 million in total revenue in Q2 2023 compared to $27 million in Q2 2022. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $739 million was down 1% year-over-year. Mid-teens growth in clinical led by continued momentum in oncology and genetic disease testing was offset by anticipated headwinds impacting research, including an approximately 260 basis point reduction from COVID surveillance, as well as sanctions in Russia, the impact on NovaSeq 6K consumables as customers start to transition to, but before they have fully ramped up on NovaSeq X, and constrained funding impacting many of our customers globally. Total sequencing activity on our connected high- and mid-throughput instruments grew 3% from Q1 2023 and 9% year-over-year. Research and applied was flat from Q1 and declined 1% year-over-year. Clinical sequencing activity growth remained strong, up 6% from Q1 and 23% year-over-year. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. We have been providing this information on the basis of number of sequencing runs, but in the future we will disclose these metrics in terms of gigabases sequenced to better reflect activity trends given the significant increase in output per run enabled by NovaSeq X and NextSeq 1K/2K. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $193 million grew 2% year-over-year. Stronger-than-expected shipments of NovaSeq X more than offset the anticipated decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments globally and NextSeq 550 placements in China, as well as a decrease in MiSeq shipments as customers transition to NextSeq 1K/2K. We continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1K/2K from new-to-Illumina customers, with shipments growing 8% year-over-year. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $134 million was up 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base, partially offset by lower contributions from codevelopment partnerships. Moving to regional results for Core Illumina. All regions continued to be impacted by tighter funding and budget pressures that are affecting customers' project planning and purchasing behaviors. Additionally, all regions faced the impact of high throughput customers transitioning to NovaSeq X, where we saw customers reduce NovaSeq 6K consumables purchases before they have fully ramped up activity on NovaSeq X. As Chuck mentioned, that though anticipated, this effect was magnified by the larger than expected number of NovaSeq X deliveries and a slower than expected ramp of these instruments coming online in Q2. Continued global demand for NovaSeq X instruments and our stronger-than-anticipated supply in Q2 helped offset these factors. Strong momentum in clinical also continued across the Americas, Europe and AMEA, with consumables shipments to clinical customers in these regions growing just under 20% year-over-year. Europe also benefited from the NIPT reimbursement decision in Germany last year and the national NIPT program in the Netherlands. Americas revenue of $623 million was down 2% year-over-year, and Europe revenue of $303 million grew 11% year-over-year, or 14% on a constant currency basis. AMEA revenue of $118 million declined 10% year-over-year, or 6% on a constant currency basis, which included a 14 percentage point impact from sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia. As a reminder, these regions also continued to be impacted by the slowdown in COVID surveillance year-over-year. Greater China revenue of $115 million represented a 3% decrease year-over-year, or a 1% increase on a constant currency basis. In addition to persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges that are impacting this region, revenue was negatively impacted by the local competitive landscape, particularly in mid-throughput. Moving to the rest of the Core Illumina P&amp;L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 67.0% decreased 280 basis points year-over-year. primarily driven by lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical in a launch year, as well as less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes, and higher field services and installation costs. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $531 million were up $12 million year-over-year primarily due to the full year impact of our headcount growth in 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected due to the acceleration of our expense reduction initiatives and lower performance-based compensation. As a result of the above, Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 21.2% in Q2 2023 compared to 24.9% in Q2 2022. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $22 million for the quarter grew 83% year-over-year, driven primarily by accelerating adoption of Galleri. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $174 million and increased $18 million year-over-year, driven primarily by continued investments to scale GRAIL's commercial organization. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow provided by operations was $105 million. Second quarter 2023 capital expenditures were $47 million and free cash flow was $58 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As you are aware, we have $750 million in convertible debt that matures this month. Additionally, on July 12, 2023, the European Commission imposed a €432 million fine on Illumina due to the completion of the GRAIL acquisition during the pendency of the European Commission's review. We plan to issue a guarantee and defer the payment of the fine pending the outcome of the appeal of the EU General Court's ruling that the European Commission has jurisdiction to review the GRAIL acquisition. Moving now to 2023 guidance. We now expect full year 2023 consolidated revenue to grow approximately 1%, including Core Illumina revenue that's approximately flat with 2022. As a reminder, these ranges include anticipated reductions from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points, the impact on our business from sanctions on Russia of approximately 100 basis points, as well as a year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange rates. GRAIL revenue is still expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023. For fiscal 2023, we now expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue growth of approximately 3% year-over-year reflecting our higher NovaSeq X shipment expectation, partially offset by capital and cash flow constraints that have continued to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors, including in China which also had an increased impact from local competition, primarily affecting mid-throughput. We also expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue to decline approximately 3% year-over-year, driven predominately by, one, a more persistent impact of funding issues and cautious purchasing behaviors causing project delays; a more meaningful decrease in NovaSeq 6000 sequencing ahead of planned transitions to NovaSeq X, in part due to our higher shipment expectations for NovaSeq X; three, a delay in the expected ramp of consumables on NovaSeq X; and four, a slower than anticipated second-half recovery in China. We now expect annual pull-through for NovaSeq 6000 of approximately $800,000 to $900,000 per instrument in 2023, NextSeq 550 pull-through in the range of $80,000 to $130,000, and pull-through for MiSeq in the range of $30,000 to $40,000. We still expect pull through for NextSeq 1K/2K to be within the historical guidance range of $120,000 to $170,000 and MiniSeq pull through is still expected to be within the historical range of $20,000 to $25,000 per instrument. With regard to Core Illumina sequencing revenue, we expect it to be approximately flat year-over-year. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $30 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 5% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. Our revised operating margins reflect our lower revenue expectations for the year and lower gross margins given lower manufacturing volumes and fixed cost leverage. These impacts are partially offset by acceleration of our $100 million-plus annual run rate expense reduction initiatives spanning headcount, real estate, and other costs that Chuck mentioned earlier. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 41% for 2023, which continues to include an approximately $75 million tax expense impact from R&amp;D capitalization requirements. Although the non-GAAP tax expense impact of R&amp;D capitalization requirements in dollars hasn't changed, the impact to our effective tax rate in 2023 has increased as a result of our lower earnings. Lastly, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.75 to $0.90 for 2023, which continues to include dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $670 million. Before we go to Q&amp;A, I'd like to cover guidance for the third quarter of 2023. We expect Q3 2023 consolidated revenue to grow approximately 2% year-over-year to approximately $1.14 billion. This reflects a sequential decrease of approximately 320 basis points from Q2 2023, primarily driven by a sequential decrease in NovaSeq 6000 consumables as customers continue to transition to NovaSeq X. For the third quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.10 to $0.15, reflecting consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 4% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 19%. I will now invite the operator to open the line for Q&amp;A. Thank you.

And our first question will come from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda: The NovaSeq field challenges that you're having in the market, can you talk a little bit about that? How soon can you fix these challenges? What is getting this recovery? And what does that mean for the installs in the third and fourth quarter and maybe even 2024? My question there is, the market sort of freezes to see if these challenges are resolved before taking on more instruments? And then, on the elasticity of demand, clearly, there is significantly more higher dip this year, there's a decline in sequencing consumables versus when we look at the last product launch of NovaSeq 6000. You mentioned a number of factors, but just trying to understand how much of that is due to the challenges that you're facing in the field. And, look, the NovaSeq is definitely selling despite the challenges, so maybe could you just update us on the CEO search as well? Charles Dadswell: I've been listening to you guys now for a long time and it's nice to be able to be part of the conversation. So as far as the NovaSeq X, some of the positives of the launch of an instrument of this magnitude are that we've placed more instruments than we thought. It also has some of the biggest software placements that we've ever seen. And it's revolutionary from the ground up. What we did is we underestimated the amount of time it would ultimately take to bring these instruments online. But our technical teams are working with our customers to bring them up to speed as quickly as we can. Joydeep Goswami: Puneet, maybe I'll jump in. A couple of things. First, as you know, with any of these launches of this magnitude, as you go out into the field, and as you start installing it, you find some bugs that you have to go resolve. So what we have seen in Q2 was nothing out of the ordinary. We have actually – already have fixes for the issues that we have seen and are in the process of deploying these fixes to our customers. So it has meant a little bit of delay in our original expectations of when these instruments would be fully up to speed. But it hasn't changed any of our or our customer expectations on NovaSeq X. And I will also really urge you to consider that it's not all customers that see this. So some customers are fully [Technical Difficulty], while others, as they have experienced these issues, we are really all hands on deck to go fix these issues in the field. The other thing is that you talked about elasticity in terms of volume increase and sequencing volume increase. Look, we're not seeing any fundamental change to elasticity. The issues that you've seen are more related to transition to the X. So what we have seen is because of the larger number of Xs installed in the in the area because we moved up some of the supply of Xs, we have seen that the decline in the 6k consumables has been faster and larger than we had expected. Again, this is the flip side of people really being excited about the X and our ability to deliver more Xs. So that's what has happened. It's a temporary decline. And we expect that as we ramp up fully on the on the Xs that that volume will come back on in terms of X consumables. But what you're seeing now is this timing gap that we have between those two events. And you said something about – I think there was – whether these challenges on the X are continuing or they'll cause a stall in the market. actually, they haven't caused a stall in the market. We have seen demand for the X and our late stage pipeline continue to ramp up. As Chuck mentioned in his prepared remarks that we have seen the X actually enable experiments and solutions that were not hitherto possible. So we do see continued interest in the X and the continued interest in doing things that were not possible before. And, Chuck, I'll turn it back over to you to for the CEO search. Charles Dadswell: In regards to the CEO search, the board's actively searching for our new CEO. The search includes both internal and external candidates. They've been really encouraged about the outstanding quality of candidates they're seeing. But, of course, you know that the details of the board's processes on this are confidential. We'll be able to update you as soon as we can. Operator: And our next question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Dan Brennan: Maybe a couple here packed into one, I guess. The $25 billion flow cell, is that still on track? When will that ship, given some of the issues that you've cited? Second part, China. China actually grew in the quarter, but I know you called out some pressure there. So kind of what's baked in now for China in the back half of the year. Third part would be, reference customer challenges throughout which obviously the broader tool spaces that are really challenging second quarter, but that said, the academic and government end market has actually been pretty robust outside of China. So I'm wondering if you can discuss a little bit where are you seeing these challenges? And then the final point would just be on the NovaSeq consumable pull-through card, and you're mentioning customers are switching faster over to the X. I guess, how do we get comfortable that you're not seeing some either competitive impact or some dampening of utilization, I guess. Kind of what was different this time around, do you think, in terms of your forecasting versus [indiscernible] management forecasted during the last cycle? Charles Dadswell: I think, first, we continue to prioritize our investments. They're proprietary and we still continue to focus on the differentiation of products. We probably have the biggest and the best proprietary pipeline in the industry. And we continue to lean on it. The 25b flow cell remains on track for launch in second half of 2023. We continue to push forward on the Illumina CLR enrichment assay. That's particularly compelling when you're using it with the 25B flow cell. We continue to move forward on the X-LEAP SBS chemistry for NovaSeq 1k/2k. And we're going to have future offerings for emerging markets for things like proteomics, multiomics, and spatialJoydeep Goswami: Maybe I'll jump in on China, right. So, yes, we did see, like other companies, a slower than expected recovery in the second half of the year. Remember, we had expected China in the first half of the year to be somewhat soft and recovering from the COVID challenges. And then we had expected an acceleration in that recovery in the second half of the year. We do not currently see that happening, both because of some of the challenges that you've seen in the broader economy in China, but also for us from an increased competitive intensity that we are seeing in China in the mid throughput and low throughput segments. Your second part of the question was on the everything ex-China, right? So, there it's a – I don't think the situation is dire as it was in last year. What we are seeing is a little bit of conservatism, given the economic uncertainty in the speed at which people are coming back online or purchasing. So we have seen a little bit of lengthening of cycles in terms of purchasing behavior, both on our instrument side for mid throughput and low throughput and also on some of the consumables pieces. Activity, as I indicated, remains strong, but it's just that any newer projects and newer instruments that are coming in are slower than we had expected. Our win rate in – and we track this pretty closely – in terms of both mid throughput and, of course, on the high throughput side remains high. In fact, it picked up slightly compared to Q1 in Q2. So, again, I think it's more of a lengthening out of cycles and purchasing cycles, rather than anything related to competitive intensity on those fronts. On the X, the issue is not competition at all. As I indicated, we are seeing continued strong interest and strong interest from, of course, our existing customers, but also new newer customers or people that are moving up from mid throughput. We continue to see that our ability to actually deliver on the instruments continues to maintain that interest. As Chuck mentioned, in terms of what these instruments are enabling, there's a whole new set of experiments that are on a larger scale going forward. Again, this is a lead indicator for us. Obviously, people have not ramped up on the X fully. But it is a lot about transitioning to the X and being able to take advantage of the many capabilities that it's providing beyond just the price aspect of it. So the DRAGEN onboard, the faster capabilities, the simplicity of the workflow, obviously, the ambient ship reagents. So there's a lot that goes into that, beyond just the focus on, oh, it's going to help us with the lower price per Gb. Operator: And our next question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel. Dan Arias: Joydeep, obviously, quite a few moving parts here on the top line and the OpEx line. And it looks like what you're doing in terms of cost reduction and expense management is part of a multiyear effort. I guess, given where this year is headed, how are you thinking about op margins next year for the core business relative to the 25% target that you talked about last quarter? Joydeep Goswami: A couple of things. So, one, you're right, we started off as we committed to in our Q1 earnings call. We started off a broad look at cost structure. And actually at the end of Q1, we proceeded with beginning a cost reset that we have executed on and actually have taken out on a run rate basis more than $100 million annually of cost. During the second half of the year, just given some of the uncertainties in the broader economic space, we continue to keep a very close eye on managing expenses and being very careful about allocating expenses to the highest return areas, including the innovation areas that that Chuck talked about. Given the challenges we are having this year, obviously, we acknowledge that getting to margins next year is going to seem like a stretch, but we remain very committed to planning for and delivering on those margins. And that's the way we're moving forward. Operator: And we have a question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar: I had a two part question. Mostly on the guidance here. I think, third quarter, you said 3%. Your comps for fourth quarter look pretty easy. And historically, when I've looked at your sequential revenue ramp from second quarter, it's always been up. Now look at your second quarter trends sequentially, instruments are up, consumables are up, your pull-through per box is up, China was up. So, anything incremental headwinds that we should be thinking about for the back half? Why your back half shouldn't follow historical patterns? And I think a related question here. You mentioned 800,000 to 900,000 pull through on the Nova 6k. I think there's been some concern. The pull through on the NovaSeq X perhaps might be lower because of the lower sample price point. Maybe can you just walk us through your assumptions around pull through for the Nova X? Could we perhaps see a rebound because I'm assuming inventory levels here for customers are pretty low and they need to restock? Joydeep Goswami: That was a long, multipart question. So let me let me try to get to unpack some of that. So first of all, for the full year guidance, given that it has come down, the components roughly fall into three categories. About 25% of the reduction kin guidance really comes from China. And as I mentioned earlier, for China, that's a two part thing. We are seeing a slower than expected recovery in the larger economy, including some liquidity challenges for mainly our clinical customers. And we are seeing a higher competitive intensity that affect the mid throughput and low throughput segments. That's 25%. The other 75% is roughly equally split into two buckets. So one part is around the transition to the X and the gap we are seeing in terms of the high throughput consumables, right?And this is an issue of the 6k consumables going down pretty rapidly as people are planning to transition to the X and again exacerbate it somewhat by the larger number of Xs we are delivering. And the other part is a slightly slower than expected ramp up on the full utilization of the X. The other 50% of that 75% is coming from some of the customer conservatism that we're seeing in terms of longer sales cycles and slower than expected recovery across the board beyond China. So now second quarter versus the first quarter and then third quarter versus second quarter, so we did see a ramp up from first quarter and the second quarter across many dimensions. Obviously, we shipped more Xs. So we saw a jump on the instrument side. We did see a healthy ramp up on our 6k consumables, primarily driven by the clinical segment. And you're right, we did actually see a jump from Q1 to Q2 in China. But that was expected given China was really depressed for us and other companies in Q1. Moving on to Q3, what you're seeing in some of the sequential ramp down, there are two big reasons for it, right? One, the aforementioned 6k consumable reduction is going to hit sort of a local maxima there because of the larger transition expected to the X. So we're shipping more Xs. That impact on the 6k consumables is going to ramp up. And we don't yet have a full ramp up on our X consumables yet, right? We expect that in Q4, and I'll come back to that. And the other piece is we do expect China to actually be down slightly from Q2, again, because of the expectation that the recovery is proceeding unfortunately more slowly than we had expected. And then, the last piece around that, and just we do expect Q4 to be up significantly, and Q4 is the first quarter you actually start seeing the X consumables come in. You see your traditional end of the year ramp up in some of the spend from company. So you are still seeing that, and that's built into our guidance. The last thing you mentioned was about pull through. By the way, we have not given you pull through on X. As with all new instruments, we'll only come out with that once the instrument ramp up has stayed stabilized. So we do expect, given the interest in X and the kinds of cohort studies and experiments that our customers are telling us they want to do on X, we do expect that our initial assumptions and pull through are still justified. On the NovaSeq 6000, which is probably what you were referring to, we have called down our pull through numbers for this year. But that is really driven by the transition to the X and the larger than expected impact of that transition that I've talked about. Operator: And we'll take a question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant: One, Chuck, for you on the leadership changes here. Perhaps, Joydeep, feel free to chime in as well. Dan asked about sort of margins and your commitment to 25% and you call that sort of stretchy, but something that you're certainly committed to. Would that sort of framing apply to your mid-teens girls that you talked about at the analyst day as well for Core Illumina. Chuck, for you on the leadership changes, beyond sort of the CEO seat, obviously, the CTO and CMO search is underway as well. Any color you can share there on the thought process behind that? On the base business itself, on the NovaSeq, placements here for the X clearly came in, I think it was 28 to 30 units above the piece where we were, but sequencing instrument revenue beat us by only about 5% to 6%. Right? So the question really is, are you seeing more aggressive discounting? Is that something Illumina is pushing through in response to the macroenvironment? You called out sort of BGI starting to be sort of competitive in China, but just any color on just the pricing dynamics on the instrument side would be helpful as well. Charles Dadswell: On the executive team and on the process here, so I think the first thing we want to do is just both thank Alex and Phil for all the things that they've done for Illumina. With Alex, what we know is that he's moving on to a new role. He'll be taking the CEO in another company. And I think that we should be really proud to see the kind of leaderships that we grow out of Illumina. So Alex started with Illumina, went over to GRAIL, he came back to Illumina and now he's going to land as a CEO. And we're all looking forward to kind of where that's going to be. We have a really deep bench in our R&amp;D program. And it's really heartening to see employee number four, Steve Barnard, who is the first scientist the company ever hired, bringing him into that role. He knows the technology, he knows the team, and he'll be able to seamlessly pick up where Alex left off. On the Chief Medical Officer, we're going to take some time and look at that organization. We're going to evaluate where we are on the clinical side and on the medical side. Our commitment to our clinical customers, our clinical markets, and our clinical programs continues, and we'll open up that search after we have some time to examine exactly where that organization fits and what we need.Joydeep Goswami: Picking up on your other questions, first of all, in terms of margins and the implied long term growth in mid-teens, look, the long term growth in mid-teens – by the way, our expectations on that have not changed and that, as you know, underpinned on two things. One, a large and growing market that NGS is still under penetrated in and the ability then by – through our innovations addressing the core needs of that market for NGS and Illumina to take an ever growing share. And that then manifests itself in the sequencing volume growth along the three dimensions I had mentioned earlier, first around ever increasing number of samples, again, more cohorts and things like spatial and single cell really driving more of that. The increasing number of analyses per sample. So again, that's really being driven by NGS being able to handle more of the multiomics side of the questions that our customers are asking. And lastly, just the higher sequencing intensity, right? So as you move towards larger panels, as you do more things in liquid biopsy, or things like MRD. So all those remain intact. I think where we are really looking for in the next year or so, as X kind of comes online and enables a lot of these moves into things that we talked about, how quickly does that ramp take place? But in the long term, nothing of what we had guided to really has changed in our mind, and we are looking forward to seeing how the X kind of evolves us down that path. You had asked two other questions. So one was around – the X and the revenue growth on the instrument side not being that high. As I mentioned, right, so we are very pleased that we were able to deliver on the X and ramp up our supply much faster than expected. I think it's a good thing in the long run. What offset that higher number of Xs was two things that I mentioned earlier. So, one, we did see on the China side that we did have a lower than expected number of mid-throughput and low throughput instruments. And in general, overall, given some of the lengthening of the purchasing cycles, we did see a lower than expected mid-throughput and low throughput instrument sales across the world. Now, unlike as in China where competitive intensity was a factor, in the rest of the world, we actually did not see our win rate go down. We actually saw it climb a little bit in Q2. Also, with respect to pricing, we track this very closely, right? So in China, yes, we are being very surgical about when to use price and given the type of customer. But we did see a price decline overall in China. In the rest of the world, our price actually remains on track to where we expected it to be. And we're proceeding along what we wanted to do with – using price as a means to encourage faster adoption of our technologies. Operator: And our next question is from Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank. Sung Ji Nam: Just a clarification question in terms of the cautious purchasing behavior, is that more for your academic customers? Or is it also across clinical as well? And then sorry if I missed it, but what percentage, I guess, of the consumable delay in purchases is attributable to the launch of the higher density, the 25B, and kind of waiting for the better economics in terms of sequencing? Joydeep Goswami: The cautious purchasing behavior, again, broadly, ex of China is across both academic and clinical segments, right? The reasons are slightly different. I think a lot of our clinical customers are not profit making companies. So they are managing their cash as you would expect them to. And while they continue to have sequencing at their core, we have seen that their purchasing intensity has come off less quickly than we had expected it to. In terms of your second question on how much of a delay is there for 25B, I don't think there's a delay in 25B. So what I was trying to articulate is, the reset in guidance for the whole year, about 25% of that came from the impact from China, the other 75%, about 50% of that 75% really came down to this impact on high throughput consumables due to the transition on X. So that includes, as I said, more transition on the 6k faster and then a little bit of a delay, given some of the issues I had mentioned in Q2 that we're already deploying solutions in the field. There's a little bit of delay that is that is flowing through in 2023. Operator: And we have a question from Rachel Vatnsdal with J.P. Morgan. Rachel Vatnsdal: First up on guidance, you cut revenue growth by 750 basis points at the midpoint for the year. You've walked through a few of the moving pieces between more cautious CapEx environment in China and then some of these lower consumables as customers are transitioning to the new platform. So can you just give us a more granular breakdown from that 750 basis point cut? How is it really broken out across those three areas? As a follow up, I just want to follow up on some of the earlier comments on China, just mainly relating to some of these stimulus packages. We've heard that there could potentially be another tranche of stimulus in 4Q. So what are you hearing regarding stimulus packages? I know you guys weren't seeing much of the benefit in 1Q, but did you see anything in 2Q? And then how is stimulus contemplated in guidance for the back half of the year?Joydeep Goswami: I mentioned the breakdowns earlier. So very quickly, Rachel, I think about 25% of that guidance reset is really coming from the impact from China. Of the remaining 75%, approximately 50% of that 75% really was coming from the impact on high throughput consumables related to the transition to the X. And then the other 50% is some of the cash conservatism that we're seeing with customers outside of China. Right? So that's roughly how we see the math working out. In China, first of all, there is no stimulus built into our expectations for the second half of the year. There never was in our guidance as well. As far as we could see, the stimulus in the first half of the year benefited more of the industrial segments, which we don't play in. And there is no – we didn't see any stimulus in the second half – sorry, the second quarter either, right? So it's consistent. We've not built it in and we hadn't initially as well. Operator: And our next question will come from John Sourbeer with UBS. John Sourbeer: Maybe just a couple of clarifications. So appreciate confirming the long term guidance in the mid-teens. It does sound, though, that some of the China headwinds there could be structural with some of the competition increases there. I guess, just has the long term outlook for that market change at all? Just follow up here, just on the complete long reads, any color there? What you're seeing the demand for that launch? Joydeep Goswami: Let me take those in order. So, I think for China in terms of the long term outlook, I think China remains an important market for us. And we are committed to serving our customers in China. Our brand in China actually is very positive. And again, we remain committed to serving that market. Now, again, given some of the changes we're seeing, we will continue to kind of refine our strategy in terms of how we go to market there, the kinds of partners we choose in order to reach the relevant segments, the highest growing segments of the market better and more efficiently. So none of that has changed. But we continue to observe how China is going to evolve from its current condition as most other people in our space are. In terms of the Illumina complete long reads, so the interest on that has been very high, right? We have a large number of customers that have taken the current WGS product, and are working on it. I think really we have always anticipated that the real jump into this technology would come from the enrichment product, which we are on track to delivering, but that also is coupled because of the economics involved in it, really coupled with the launch of the 25B flow cell, right? So that is still coming through towards the end of this year and really pick up as we go into 2024. Operator: And that concludes our Q&amp;A session. I will now hand the call back over to Salli Schwartz. Salli Schwartz : Thank you again for joining us today.

The growth was driven by a remarkable 33.9% rise in New Construction and a noteworthy 7.6% increase in Restore, Rebuild &amp; Replace (""R3"") segments.Adjusted EBITDA of $74.0 million grew 46% from a year ago, attributable to higher revenues primarily in the New Construction and R3 sales channels, partly offset by higher general and administrative expenses.Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.3%, an increase of 680 basis points from the prior-year period owing to more revenues from commercial actions taken in 2022 and product mix. This was partly offset by increased labor costs as the business scales for continued growth, including additional investments in cutting-edge Nok??

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at Southern (NYSE:SO), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Southern is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.046 = US$5.7b ÷ (US$137b - US$13b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Southern has an ROCE of 4.6%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.5%. See our latest analysis for Southern roceIn the above chart we have measured Southern's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Southern here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Southern's historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly demand attention. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 4.6% and the business has deployed 26% more capital into its operations. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.The Bottom LineLong story short, while Southern has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 81% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Southern   (of which 2 are potentially serious!) that you should know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The tie-up aims to provide an advanced digital platform, which can be accessed at myCigna by specific employer-sponsored plan clients of Cigna Healthcare from the very beginning of 2024.The new platform is an initiative to extend a connected and more customized experience to bring enhanced whole-person well-being for around 11 million customers of Cigna. And taking the help of Virgin Pulse seems to be an apt move on the part of CI since the former leverages AI-powered technology and behavior change science, which imparts clients the ability to manage their mental, physical and social health. Subsequently, an individual can make better health choices, set attainable targets and earn financial rewards.The platform empowers users with the flexibility to connect a compatible fitness device or input some basic daily metrics, like weight or number of hours slept, and consequently, keep a check on their progress. On the basis of the customers’ information, preferences and claims experience, myCigna will direct them to other suitable programs of Cigna Healthcare linked with pre-diabetes management or behavioral health services.The latest initiative reflects Cigna’s ardent endeavor to extend advanced digital solutions to its health plan clients. This, in turn, might lure more plan sponsors and clients to opt for Cigna Healthcare’s plans and thereby, provide an impetus to the segment in the days ahead. Through this unit, Cigna serves customers of U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses.An increase in the customer base is expected to fetch higher premiums for Cigna, which remain the most significant contributor to any health insurer’s top line. Total medical customers of CI increased 9.5% year over year as of Jun 30, 2023. The health insurance marketplace frequently witnesses launches of advanced digital health solutions by multiple healthcare providers to meet the surge in demand for virtual care since the advent of the COVID pandemic. Therefore, the move to bring an enhanced digital platform seems aptly timed by Cigna.Story continuesApart from the Cigna Healthcare unit, the Evernorth business of Cigna has also put its foot forward to capitalize on the trend to go digital and boost customer base. Last year, the unit added five app- based programs to its clinical platform, Digital Health Formulary. The offerings comprised authenticated and trustworthy health apps devised to achieve better health outcomes.

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study TE Connectivity's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for TE Connectivity How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TE Connectivity is:18% = US$2.1b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of TE Connectivity's Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo start with, TE Connectivity's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Despite this, TE Connectivity's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared TE Connectivity's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 15% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is TEL worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether TEL is currently mispriced by the market.Is TE Connectivity Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 30% (or a retention ratio of 70%), TE Connectivity hasn't seen much growth in its earnings. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Moreover, TE Connectivity has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 27%. As a result, TE Connectivity's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 20% for future ROE.SummaryOverall, we feel that TE Connectivity certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $39.8 million, the contract is projected to be completed by June 2025. Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide lead yard support and development studies and design efforts related to Virginia class submarines.Work related to this contract will be executed in the continental U.S.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly due to upgrading and improvising defense systems with technologically advanced features. Military submarines with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form an integral part of any nation’s defense system.The increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Electric Boat business unit is a prime contractor of submarines.Looking ahead, General Dynamics, along with an industry partner, is currently working on Blocks IV and V in the Virginia Class program. The company has 17 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog, scheduled for delivery through 2032.Notably, nine of the boats in Block V include the Virginia Payload Module, an 84-foot Electric Boat-designed-and-built hull section that adds four additional payload tubes, more than tripling the strike capacity of these submarines and providing unique capabilities to support special missions.Electric Boat is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering, leading the construction of Virginia-class attack submarines. The aforementioned developments should usher in more contracts for General Dynamics, like the latest one. These contracts, in turn, are expected to boost the company’s growth.Story continuesPeer MovesNations are strengthening their defense capabilities. Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% during 2023-2028. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the military submarine space.A few defense primes that can reap the benefits of the expanding submarine market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines, the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines, can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.BAESY’s long-term earnings growth rate is 14.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 15.7%.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. It also provides launch systems for submarines. NOC’s eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.5%.Huntington Ingalls has a teaming agreement with Electric Boat to build Virginia-class fast-attack nuclear submarines. Its Newport News division is participating in the design and construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HII’s 2023 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 3.2%. Huntington Ingalls delivered an average earnings surprise of 1.76% in the last four quarters.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, General Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip stocks, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Out of these, a mere handful manages to catch public attention due to a variety of factors. These firms can either be popular household names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), firms that have created new industries like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or companies that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and are known for their financial stability and strength.Firms at the top of the stock market food chain are often referred to as Blue Chip stocks. The term 'Blue Chip' is more than a century old, and as you might have guessed, it comes from poker where players assign a monetary value to chips and then gamble on them with cards. A blue chip stock in the 1920s would typically have a share price greater than $200 and the term was coined by a reporter for Dow Jones. These days, there are no fixed criteria to define a firm as a blue chip, however, the typical classification normally includes the 30 stocks included in the Dow 30 index.Investing in blue chip stocks typically offers a variety of benefits that one might be unable to accrue when investing in other stocks such as penny stocks or small cap stocks. These firms are typically quite resilient to significant share price drops due to their size and stability, and their popularity also provides the market with plenty of liquidity. Not to mention, several blue chip stocks also pay dividends. We took a closer look at blue chip firms with large market capitalization and stable dividend growth as part of our 12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy coverage and determined that the top dividend paying stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesAugust is an important month for the stock market as it will see several large firms report their earnings for the second quarter of 2023. These earnings come at a time when high interest rates take their toll on corporate spending, but lowering inflation provides consumers with more leeway to make expensive purchases. To add to this, the earnings also provide important hints about the current state of the U.S. economy, to enable analysts and economists to determine whether a recession might materialize just when everybody starts looking the other way.One blue chip stock that reported its earnings in August is Apple. The largest technology company in the world saw its quarterly revenue drop for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the revenue for the first three quarters also fell. However, Apple still beat analyst EPS estimates due to lower costs in administrative and other expenses. Another blue chip firm and one whose sales are closely watched to measure consumer spending power is Coca-Cola. It is the largest beverage company in the world and one that had a strong second quarter as it managed to beat analyst EPS estimates by a wide margin. Coca-Cola reported $12 billion in net revenues for the quarter, which marked a 6% annual growth. The results indicated that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation, and the revenue growth also enabled Coca-Cola to report a 34% GAAP EPS growth.However, for the beverages company, the biggest takeaway from its second quarter of 2023 earnings was not the revenue or the EPS figures. Instead, it was Coca-Cola's guidance, as the company upgraded its non-GAAP revenue guidance to predict an 8% to 9% organic growth for the full year 2023. Corporate guidance is a crucial factor in an earnings season like the one we're currently in the middle of. This is because firms have a real time view of their operations which leaves them in a better position to predict future outcomes. These outcomes, when put together, can also provide the tea leaves to make a prediction of the broader economic performance.Joining Coca-Cola as an important company whose earnings guidance and financial performance are also an economic barometer is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The retailer has direct contact with consumers due to its business model, and while it has not reported its latest earnings, investment bank Credit Suisse has some good news for the stock as it has increased Walmart's share price target to $180 from $170. Credit Suisse believes that Walmart is positioned well to handle any volatility in consumer spending as its entire approach is based on providing customers with value.With this context, let's take a look at the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to Wall Street.

A Detailed AnalysisHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with VF should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score of 2, and Altman Z-score of 1.39. These indicators suggest that VF, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-scoreThe Piotroski F-score, created by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, is a tool used to assess the strength of a company's financial health. The score is based on nine criteria that fall into three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/ source of funds, and operating efficiency. The overall score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating healthier financials. VF's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls in the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors.Story continuesBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company OverviewVF designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories. Its apparel categories are active, outdoor, and work. Its portfolio of about a dozen brands includes Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies. VF markets its products in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific through wholesale sales to retailers, e-commerce, and branded stores owned by the company and partners. The company has grown through multiple acquisitions and traces its roots to 1899.Is VF Corp (VFC) a Value Trap? A Detailed AnalysisAnalysis of VF's ProfitabilityLet's delve deeper into VF's financial health by examining the decline in its return on assets (ROA) over the past three years. The data indicates 2020: 3.07; 2021: 7.66; 2022: 7.45; 2023: 0.84, when expressed in percentages. Such a decrease is concerning, as the Piotroski F-Score penalizes companies with lower current ROA compared to the previous period. This ongoing decline highlights another potential risk associated with investing in VF.Observing the financials of VF, it's important to note that the cash flow from operations over the trailing twelve months (TTM) stands at $-133.9 million, whereas the net income in the same period is significantly higher at $117.12 million. The Piotroski F-score considers this discrepancy as a potential red flag. The rationale behind this is that a company's operating cash flow is a more direct and less manipulated measure of its cash-generating ability than net income. Net income, while important, is susceptible to accounting treatments and non-cash items which can distort the true cash profitability of the company. If a company consistently shows lower cash flows from operations relative to its net income, it could indicate that the earnings quality is poor and the company might have difficulties sustaining its operations or financing its obligations, a fact which could negatively impact its financial stability and investor confidence.Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendAssessing the aspect of leverage, liquidity, and sources of funds, VF demonstrates an alarming rise in its debt-to-total assets ratio over the past three years. The provided data shows 2020: 0.54; 2021: 0.51; 2022: 0.48; 2023: 0.56, expressed as percentages. A higher debt ratio suggests that VF is increasingly financing its assets through debt, thereby escalating its financial risk. The Piotroski F-Score views this as a negative indicator, further cautioning investors about VF.Is VF Corp (VFC) a Value Trap? A Detailed AnalysisExamining VF's financial stability, there's a notable decrease in its current ratio over the past three years, as shown by the data 2020: 3.65; 2021: 1.49; 2022: 1.33; 2023: 1.37, which is expressed as percentages. The current ratio is a key indicator of a company's short-term financial health, as it gauges the ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. A declining current ratio suggests that VF's liquidity and capability to manage immediate financial obligations are deteriorating.Operating Efficiency: A Darker PictureLastly, concerning operating efficiency, the Piotroski F-score examines changes in gross margin and asset turnover. Regrettably, VF follows a discouraging trajectory with a decrease in gross margin percentage over the past three years, as demonstrated by the data provided: 2020: 54.79; 2021: 53.47; 2022: 54.04; 2023: 52.28 (expressed in percentages). This contraction in gross margin suggests that VF is grappling with either an escalation in the cost of goods sold or dwindling prices - both of which are inauspicious indicators for profitability.In terms of operational efficiency, another key indicator, VF has unfortunately reported a declining trend in asset turnover over the past three years, as evidenced by the data: 2020: 0.85; 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82 (expressed in percentages). Asset turnover measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales, and a decrease in this ratio can indicate a drop in efficiency. This could be due to various factors, such as underutilization of assets or a decline in the market demand for the company's products or services. Consequently, this downward trend in asset turnover implies that VF may need to revisit its operational strategies to improve the utilization of its assets and boost its sales volume.ConclusionWhile the Piotroski F-score is not the only lens through which to view a potential investment, it is a robust and comprehensive tool for evaluating a company's financial health. Unfortunately for VF, its current score suggests potential troubles. The declining return on assets, the discrepancy between cash flow from operations and net income, and the rising debt-to-total assets ratio are all red flags. Furthermore, the company's decreasing current ratio suggests deteriorating liquidity, while the decline in gross margin percentage and asset turnover indicate potential operational inefficiency. All these factors combined suggest that VF might be a value trap, and investors should approach with caution.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Piotroski F-score using the following Screener: Piotroski F-score screener .GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Accordingly, Zions Bancorporation National Association investors that purchase the stock on or after the 16th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.41 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.64 to shareholders.

The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Wells Fargo &amp; Company has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.81, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 21.34. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Wells Fargo &amp; Company’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint (which is 11.00) over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.85. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that Wells Fargo &amp; Company has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.01, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Wells Fargo &amp; Company stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Wells Fargo &amp; Company has a P/S ratio of about 1.62. This is a bit lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.96 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Wells Fargo &amp; Company currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20%  of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Wells Fargo &amp; Company a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Wells Fargo &amp; Company is just 0.88, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.56. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, WFC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Wells Fargo &amp; Company might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘D’ and a Momentum score of ‘B’. This gives WFC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been robust at best. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen five up and four down in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 0.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 1.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action  for the stock in the chart below:Wells Fargo &amp; Company Price and ConsensusWells Fargo &amp; Company Price and ConsensusWells Fargo &amp; Company price-consensus-chart | Wells Fargo &amp; Company QuoteDespite this positive trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineWells Fargo &amp; Company is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 11% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the earnings beat ratio of 86.6% and revenue beat ratio of 84.9% are impressive. Combining the actual results with the estimates for the still-to-report companies, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline 30% despite revenue growth of 5.4%.Many industry bigwigs reported solid results, with some beating on earnings or revenues or both. As such, pharma ETFs have been in the green over the past month. VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF PPH, iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF IHE, Invesco Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF PJP, SPDR S&amp;P Pharmaceuticals ETF XPH and First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF FTXH have gained 8.3%, 9.1%, 8%, 8.3% and 5.2%, respectively, in a month.Let’s delve deeper into the earnings of some of the bigwigs:Earnings in FocusJohnson and JohnsonJohnson &amp; Johnson JNJ continued with its long streak of earnings beat. It topped revenue estimates as well as lifted the full-year outlook. Earnings per share came in at $2.80, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 and improving 8.1% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 6.3% year over year to $25.5 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.7 billion. For 2023, Johnson &amp; Johnson lifted the revenue guidance to $98.80-$99.80 billion from the previous outlook of $97.9-$98.9 billion. It also raised the earnings per share guidance to $10.70-$10.80 from the previous outlook of $10.60-$10.70 (read: 5 ETFs to Buy on JNJ's Q2 Earnings Strength).PfizerPfizer PFE topped earnings estimates but missed on revenues. Earnings per share of 67 cents were well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. Revenues of $12.73 billion fell short of the consensus mark of $13.17 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues declined 67% and 54%, respectively. The U.S. drug giant narrowed its revenue guidance to $67-$70.0 billion from $67-$71.0 billion while maintaining its adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $3.25-$3.45.MerckMerck MRK reported better-than-expected results. Loss per share of $2.06 was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $2.17. In the year-ago period, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.87. Revenues rose 3% year over year to $15.04 billion and came in above the consensus mark of $14.39 billion. Merck lifted its 2023 revenue outlook to $58.6-$59.6 billion from the previous guidance of $57.7-$58.9 billion. It maintained earnings per share guidance in the $6.88-$7.00 range.Bristol-MyersBristol-Myers BMY reported disappointing results. It posted earnings per share of $1.75, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99 but improved from the year-ago earnings of $1.96. Revenues declined 6% year over year to $11.23 billion and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.8 billion. Bristol-Myers lowered its 2023 guidance. It expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.35-$7.65 versus the previous projection of $7.95-$8.25. Revenues are expected to decrease in low single digits compared to the previous guidance of approximately 2% increase.Eli Lilly and CompanyEli Lilly and Company LLY topped estimates on both fronts. Earnings per share came in at $2.11, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98 and 69% higher year over year. Revenues rose 28% to $8.31 billion and edged past the estimate of $7.55 billion. Eli Lilly raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance. Revenues are expected in the range of $33.4 billion to $33.9 billion, up from its previous outlook of $31.2 billion to $31.7 billion.

(PFE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-trending-stock-130010244.html,1691758810,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -0.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 8.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share, indicating a change of -64% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.32 points to a change of -49.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.23 indicates a change of -2.8% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Pfizer is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -33.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $66.48 billion and $66.06 billion estimates indicate -33.7% and -0.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $12.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -54.1%. EPS of $0.67 for the same period compares with $2.04 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.03%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Why the Timing Feels Right,CoinDesk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-stablecoin-no-libra-why-161629297.html,1691770589,STORY,['PYPL'],"[This week, Rep. Maxine Waters, (D-California) declared she was “deeply concerned” with payments giant PayPal (PYPL) for launching a stablecoin under the New York Department of Financial Services regulatory framework before federal legislation addressing such crypto instruments has been debated. The moment had echoes of the battle over the doomed Libra project, which Waters also vehemently opposed.But the circumstances are quite different from four years ago, when Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms (META), rolled out a basket-based stablecoin to a barrage of regulator criticism around the world. The attacks were so heavy that they ultimately stymied Libra’s advance, leaving it to wither and die, even after a radical redesign intended to appease regulators and a name change to Diem.You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Libra was one of those rare issues that generated bipartisanship — in opposition to the project, rather than for it — in part because at that time other concerns about Facebook’s treatment of user data had turned it, briefly, into a pariah for politicians.By contrast, the stablecoin industry now seems to have won over a decent number of backers in Congress, mostly from one side. Last month, House Republicans successfully pushed stablecoin legislation through the House Financial Services Committee. And, while its passage was more contentious than many had hoped, with Waters herself leading Democrat resistance, the bill seems likely to win support in the Republican-controlled House when it goes to a floor vote.PayPal has now complicated the outlook for this bill’s passage through the Senate. I tend to agree with observers, cited in a piece by CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton this week, who argued that PayPal, in upsetting Democrats by jumping the gun on the legislation, will harden the resolve of the party’s anti-crypto crusaders in the Senate, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts). And that could halt the bill’s passage in the upper chamber, where Warren’s party controls the majority.Story continuesBut in the grand scheme of things, PayPal’s project is in a far stronger position politically than the universally mistrusted Libra ever was. Republicans are thrilled that the payments company launched its stablecoin, known as PYUSD, at this moment. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-North Carolina), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, called the move a “clear signal that stablecoins — if issued under a clear regulatory framework — hold promise as a pillar of our 21st-century payments system” and made it “more important than ever” to keep moving the legislation forward.Just as importantly, PayPal’s move follows a slew of initiatives from financial establishment players to prod policymakers to support their own engagement in the crypto industry. BlackRock (BLK), Fidelity Investments, Invesco and many more are now pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission to support newly revived submissions seeking approval of bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, Charles Schwab (SCHW), Fidelity and Citadel are jointly seeking regulatory approval for a new crypto exchange. These institutions do their homework in Washington before going down paths like this, as does PayPal.Read more: David Z. Morris - PayPal’s Real Stablecoin Strategy: It Wants to Earn Interest on Your DepositsPeople are rightfully concerned about the polarization and politicization of the crypto debate. But with six Democrats — a surprisingly large number — breaking ranks in the House Financial Services Committee to support a separate McHenry-sponsored bill that creates a broad regulatory framework for crypto, the risk of gridlocked stalemate mightn’t be as high as feared, especially given the clout of the companies now showing their support for the industry.The other factor in PayPal’s favor is that, unlike Libra, it is offering up a dollar-only stablecoin, which could boost demand for the U.S. currency around the world and that it doesn’t have nearly the same global footprint as Facebook had at the time of the Libra launch. Libra’s first iteration was a token pegged to a multicurrency basket, which many policymakers saw as a threat to monetary sovereignty. They feared that, if Facebook’s billions of users shifted to using the token, it would directly diminish demand for their domestic currencies.PayPal may well face some grandstanding opposition from Democrats and that might hold up legislation. But it’s hard to see this development as being on the wrong side of history. Sooner rather than later, stablecoins will enjoy a constructive regulatory framework in the U.S. and that could spur a dramatic change in money that newcomers like PayPal and old-timers like Tether and Circle will be well placed to exploit.]"

(PYPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-trending-130009494.html,1691758809,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -13.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has lost 1.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.9%. This estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.62 indicates a change of +13.6% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.66 billion and $32.35 billion estimates indicate +7.8% and +9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $0.93 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.43%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, typically the U.S. dollar.“Investors may have been fine holding non-yield bearing stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-terms rates above 5%,” the analysts wrote.Read more: Congresswoman Maxine Waters Says She’s ‘Deeply Concerned’ About PayPal’s New StablecoinThe payments giant earlier this week said that it was entering the crypto market with its own dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD, in a first for a major financial company. The Ethereum-based token will be available first on PayPal and then on Venmo, and can be exchanged for dollars at any time.Investors are likely indifferent to which stablecoins they hold as long as they are perceived as “safe and accessible on the largest trading platforms,” the report said.Bank of America says it doesn’t expect PYUSD’s launch to lead to “accelerated regulatory clarity” because the stablecoin’s issuance “does not alter systemic risk for traditional markets,” but it could face regulatory hurdles if nonbanks are ultimately banned from issuing stablecoins.PYUSD will likely target a market that has remained largely untapped until now, including “blockchain technology-enabled asset transfers, payments and remittances,” the report added.Read more: Stablecoin Market to Soar to Almost $3T in Next 5 Years: Bernstein]"

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Hewlett Packard Enterprise has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while IBM has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that HPE has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.HPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.36, while IBM has a forward P/E of 15.18. We also note that HPE has a PEG ratio of 1.77. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 3.64.Another notable valuation metric for HPE is its P/B ratio of 1.11. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, IBM has a P/B of 5.86.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, HPE holds a Value grade of A, while IBM has a Value grade of C.HPE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than IBM, so it seems like value investors will conclude that HPE is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.4bUS$12.3bUS$13.1bUS$13.6bUS$14.2bUS$14.6bUS$15.1bUS$15.5bUS$15.9bUS$16.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 4.53%Est @ 3.82%Est @ 3.32%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.55%Est @ 2.43% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$10.5kUS$10.4kUS$10.2kUS$9.8kUS$9.3kUS$8.9kUS$8.4kUS$7.9kUS$7.5kUS$7.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$90bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.2%) = US$252bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$252b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$109bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$199b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$143, the company appears quite good value at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Business Machines as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.316. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for International Business MachinesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

""It's very difficult to create a $100 million brand and all of a sudden make it a billion dollar brand inside those big companies.""Tilray aims to make 'craft beer cool again'Tilray has been challenged in recent years as the high around cannabis continues to fade. Shares of the cannabis and consumer brands company are down nearly 90% compared to 2018.As the company waits for weed legalization in the US, it has pushed into adjacent categories, such as beer and spirits. Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday he wants to ""diversify the brand"" and ""make sure we were not dependent upon legalization.""Tilray's stock soared 36% on Tuesday following the deal, a move Morningstar strategist Kristoffer Inton said he ""didn't get."" On the deal overall, though, Inton remained ambivalent.On one hand, ""it's adding to a [craft beer] strategy that they've had been going down for a bit,"" Inton said. ""Buying these wasn't a surprise, in that sense.

But for now, he said, the acquisition is aimed at making ""craft beer cool again"" and ramping up its manufacturing capabilities in the Northeast.The acquisition comes as Anheuser-Busch InBev's Bud Light sales are beginning to stabilize after months-long fallout from boycotts over an advertisement for the brand by transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.Tilray CEO Simon said this acquisition was ""totally separate"" from the Bud Light controversy. He added that all employees from the respective brands will join Tilray, and the company is ""working with them on a transition.""In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Anheuser-Busch executive Andy Thomas said that Tilray reached out earlier this year ""with interest in purchasing these brands and breweries.""Although Anheuser-Busch shed some of its craft beer brands, Thomas added the Bud Light maker is still ""committed to its craft brewery partners ... and focused on working with them to lead growth in the segment.""Molson Coors exec: Whiskeys, bourbons 'are on fire'In the background, Molson Coors continues to gain momentum.In recent years, the US-Canadian company has been quietly expanding its overall beverage portfolio, partnering with energy drinks, and bringing on spirit brands.

""Companies that are better at managing smaller niche brands are going to be able to maximize the value of those brands more because they can put more resources to them,"" Portell said.

Walmart (WMT) stock rises, locking in a fourth record close this month, as the company is set to report earnings next week. Chinese ADRs slide over concerns about China's real estate sector. Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita discuss the top stocks to watch.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right. Well, let's take a look at some of the individual movers of the day. And first up, we got to start with GM and Ford, both under pressure amid labor contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers. As the September expiration date for the contracts approaches, fears of a strike are beginning to creep in. We saw that reflected not only today but really the weekly moves that we saw in both stocks here, Akiko.And I think the thought process is, at least the thinking along the lines of some of the analysts out there is that the workers, the unions might have the upper hand in this type of environment. Wells Fargo is out with a note saying that the expiring UAW contract on September 14 is the most imminent risk to GM and Ford, calling the demands audacious and really raising that risk of a strike.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, there's two-fold, right, Seana? On the one hand, there's the risk of a strike and how much that would cost to the carmakers if there is a work stoppage. There's also the realization that if they do reach some kind of contract, that's going to mean higher expenses. For these companies, you had that number out from Bloomberg this week saying that it would add more than $80 billion in expenses for each one of these American car companies.When you consider what exactly the UAW is asking for right now in their contracts, and you don't need to look further than UPS to understand where those higher costs are going to come from. They averted a strike, and yet they had expenses go up significantly as a result of the higher wages, more benefits, all of that.Story continuesSo it feels like when you look at these carmakers, there's a bit of a lose-lose situation. But certainly, investors are not looking for a strike here, but either way, looking at higher costs as a result of these negotiations. Shares of Walmart closing higher, locking in a fourth record close this month. The company also gearing up to report its quarterly results next week.Seana, we were talking to UBS' Michael Lasser earlier about the strength that Walmart has when you compare it to some of its competitors. There's a lot of expectation riding on these results in part because of Walmart's mix and where consumers are right now. You talked about Target not being a little more discretionary. Walmart in a stronger position when it comes to fresh foods, sort of these key items that consumers are going for right now, increasingly seeking out value. You could argue Walmart is in a stronger position in that space and certainly, higher expectations here going into next week's results.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. There certainly are higher expectations, especially on the heels of what we heard last quarter from these two companies, like you were just saying there, Akiko. Target, obviously, when you compare it to the position of Walmart, Walmart in a stronger position than Target just given Target's heavier reliance on some of those more discretionary items.But when it comes to Walmart and what we are expecting, Credit Suisse maintaining their outperform rating on the stock, also raising their price target to $180 this year. They are very confident just in terms of Walmart's positioning right now, what those returns will potentially look like.It was interesting though to me what we heard from Michael Lasser just about the outlook. He expects a cautious outlook here from Walmart. Despite the fact that he thinks they are going to be able to weather some of the downturn, some of the cautious consumer, at least in the coming months, he would not be surprised if we do get a cautious guidance here from Walmart given some of those macro pressures.All right. Also Chinese ADRs sliding today as concerns over China's real estate sector is coming to the forefront yet again. Country Garden issuing a profit warning, deepening fears over China's property sector, this coming two years after we had the Evergrande group's default. When you take a look at the losses across the board, Akiko, I know you're following this very closely, but really just highlights the troubling economy that China faces right now. The fact that we haven't seen this recovery pick up steam, like we initially anticipated. And obviously, some of that has to do with the massive weakness that we're seeing within the property sector.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah I mean, when you think about Country Garden the reason we're so focused on that is because that's the last of the big developers that have been able to avoid a default up until now. And when you think about this incredible growth that we have seen from China over the years, not over the last few years but over the years, it has been on the back of real estate. These developers taking on massive loads of debt to expand in a big way.And what we saw with Country Garden reporting saying they expected a loss of $7.6 billion over the first six months of the year, a lot of investors thinking back to what happened with Evergrande, and that has really brought back in the jitters there. You see Alibaba, JD.com, Baidu, all the big Chinese AVRs, they're pulling back in a big way. And by the way, Country Garden traded over in Hong Kong, seeing massive losses on the day on the back of these numbers.]"

Companies such as Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo and General Motors' (GM) Cruise will now be allowed to deploy an unlimited number of robotaxis, operating 24/7. Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo breaks down the story.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]AKIKO FUJITA: Robotaxi scoring a big victory in California. alphabet's Waymo and GM's Cruise getting final approval from regulators to expand its services in San Francisco. Here with the details and what this means for self-driving car companies, let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo. And Rachelle, was just saying the other day, more frequent sightings of Waymo at least here in LA, but there's still a lot of concern about safety with these cars.RACHELLE AKUFFO: That's right. A lot to break down here. So these driverless robotaxis from Waymo and Cruise can now hit the roads 24/7 in San Francisco with an unlimited number of vehicles. And that's thanks to a pair of votes Thursday from the California Public Utilities Commission or the CPUC.Now before Thursday's vote, the hours and the number of driverless vehicles were limited and a human had to be in the vehicle to oversee operations. Now, this expansion of driverless robotaxis in the city comes after a contentious 3-1 vote and months of delays and contention over safety, as you were mentioning there. Now before Thursday's vote, as I was talking about there, the hours and the numbers were limited there.But now we're seeing that some of the dissenting votes, especially from Commissioner Genevieve Shiroma, she was calling for more time to verify the data, saying that first responders should not be prevented from doing their job. The fact that an injury or fatality has not occurred yet is not the end of the inquiry.Now, first responders including the San Francisco Police Officers Association, the Deputy Sheriffs Association and firefighters local 798 wrote to the CPUC. Now, they highlighted their concerns about driverless vehicles stopping suddenly, proceeding through caution tape, blocking emergency services, and having to spend precious extra time either interacting with or trying to move some of these driverless vehicles when they get in the way.Story continuesNow, obviously, while Waymo and Cruise were celebrating online, Teamsters Western Regional International Vice President Peter Finn called out the companies, as well as the politicians saying, public safety decisions should not be made by regulatory bodies that are in the pocket of big tech. So some strong words there. And with that in mind, you have to wonder what this then means then for the Ubers and the Lyfts and more driverless vehicles in other cities potentially hitting the road here.Now, we know that Uber and Lyft gave up on developing their very own driverless cars. And they went with the partnership route instead. Now, Uber has already got a Waymo partnership in Phoenix. That's one of these three test cities that includes San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as a partnership for autonomous long haul trucking.Meanwhile, Lyft has a partnership with in Los Angeles. But, of course, the driverless future that we've been promised for years now just got that very big push out of California today. You still have to wait a few weeks though, for the rollout of this, but certainly a victory for these driverless companies and a lot of pushback still in terms of what's happening with first responders and safety concerns, Akiko.AKIKO FUJITA: Certainly should make the roads out here a little more interesting. Rachelle Akuffo, thanks so much for that.]"

There are concerns that a strike could be hitting the auto industry if a contract is not agreed by next month. Yahoo Finance Reporter Pras Subramanian joins the Live show to break down the news and the demands of the UAW.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Well, let's talk about Ford as well this morning because this one has been interesting to track. Tensions are growing between carmakers and the United Auto Workers Union, causing Ford and others in the sector to slide on Thursday. Concerns are now starting to rise that a strike could be hitting the auto industry should a contract not be agreed upon next month.Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian has more on this story. Pras, it's great to see you this morning. What do we know?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Brad. So yeah, it's really-- it's Ford, GM, and Stellantis, the big three that are in the sort of crosshairs of the UAW. It seems the union is really gearing up for a fight here, demanding better pay, better pension, fewer work hours, and among other things. So an analysis done by Bloomberg found that these demands over the course of a, say, a three or four-year union contract could cost the big three around $80 billion in lost profits.But, you know, on the UAW side, the union says that they took a lot of sacrifices after the Great Financial Crisis, took a lot of, sort of, concessions there to keep these automakers alive. And they have been paid back for them over the years.Meanwhile, the big three have sort of had record profits over the last few years. And even GM and Ford just this past few weeks upped their profit guidance for 2023. So there's a big fight going here where the unions are saying we need to be paid more. And the automakers say, hey, we got to be competitive versus the Teslas and the Kias and Hyundais that don't pay union wages.Story continuesHow are we going to compete against them? So it's a big fight, and we'll see who blinks first come September 14 when that is the date of the union contract goes out of-- it expires.BRAD SMITH: Hey, Pras, stay with us for a second because also in the Europe EV space separately, we're seeing some German automakers being hit hard due to semiconductor shortages, how is that playing out?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, this has been sort of a story that's been going on for some time now. And it's not a surprise that in Germany, that report out of Reuters said that an Audi executive said that the chip shortage in Germany could cause bottlenecks that could extend for years. Like I said, this has been happening for a while. It's not a breaking news.But look, the Germans in particular have been hit hard by this, they don't actually have that much local manufacturing of chips, and that's a problem for them. Porsche, in particular, had to scale back production of the Taycan EV among other cars because of the fact they lacked chips.Now, chip plants are actually coming to Germany now. Intel, a company that's going to build a plant there. But those won't come online for years. So right now, they're going to have to sort of rely on outside sources to import those chips, but it sounds like they're struggling to do so. And some studies have found, Brad, that the European automakers in particular have lost about 200 billion euros in revenue due to the chip crisis over the past few years.BRAD SMITH: Pras, I saw a Lamborghini parked outside the office. I assume that it was yours. But do correct me if I'm wrong there, I just know that our autos reporter, he rolls in some very, very classy and fine automobiles as well here.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: That was certainly not me.BRAD SMITH: Not yours, OK.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I get to borrow my girlfriend's Subaru Outback, so that's what I got, so.BRAD SMITH: It's close. It's close to a Lambo, when Lambo. You answered that question for us at your own convenience. Our own Pras Subramanian, thanks so much. Pras, appreciate it.]"
176,53626c48-67a5-3984-8b4a-ca3a2dafc98c,GM,2023-08-12,Here is What to Know Beyond Why General Motors Company (GM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-general-motors-130010843.html,1691758810,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this company have returned -15.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.4% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has lost 9.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +16.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -0.3%. This estimate has changed +9.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.17 indicates a change of -5.4% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $43.12 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $170.8 billion and $174.84 billion estimates indicate +9% and +2.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $44.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.1%. EPS of $1.91 for the same period compares with $1.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $42.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.34%. The EPS surprise was +10.4%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Walmart shares have had the opposite behavior, with the stock steadily gaining ground following subsequent quarterly releases.The performance comparison of these two stocks since the beginning of May 2022 clearly tells the story, as the chart below shows. Please note that we added the S&amp;P 500 index to the mix (the green line) to the chart.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis performance context is important to keep in mind as we look ahead to the Target and Walmart quarterly results this week, the former before the market’s open on Wednesday, August 16th, and Walmart the day after on Thursday morning (August 17th).Walmart's quarterly EPS estimates coming into this report have been very stable, with the current Zacks Consensus of $1.67 per share unchanged over the past two months. Unlike Walmart, there has been notable pressure on Target estimates, with analysts cutting their estimates on continued near-term challenges. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for Target of $1.49 is down from $1.57 a month ago, $1.58 two months ago, and $1.94 three months back.The stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart’s ‘value orientation’ allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers ‘trade down’ during times of ‘economic stress.’One key point of differentiation between these two retail giants is Walmart’s bigger grocery business which gives its results greater stability given the ‘staply’ nature of that otherwise low-margin business. The relatively low-margin nature of groceries notwithstanding, they bring in foot traffic and are also responsible for the aforementioned ‘trade down’ phenomenon that is helping Walmart gain share.Story continuesAnalysts see relatively greater momentum in Walmart’s business on the back of higher average selling prices and flat traffic, gains on the e-commerce side, and better margin results relative to what they reported last on May 18th. Target is seen as suffering from weak traffic during the period, with the price trend only marginally positive.Both companies struggled with evolving consumer behavior as the pandemic entered the rearview mirror. We saw this in their April 2022 quarterly results that we referenced at the top of this note, for which the market punished them.While both took drastic steps to steady their floundering ships, Walmart clearly did a better job adjusting to the new environment than Target. The ‘shrinkage’ aspect of inventory was also front and center when Target put a dollar number on the phenomenon the last time around. However, market participants appreciate that this aspect of ‘inventory shrink’ is hardly restricted to Target.With respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 19 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the realm in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor’s standard industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon (AMZN) and restaurant players. The 19 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q2 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q2 earnings for these 19 retailers that have reported are up +49% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues, with 78.9% beating EPS estimates and 52.6% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, the online players and restaurant operators easily beat earnings expectations but struggled with beating revenue estimates.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 19 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q2 earnings were up +526% on +10.8% higher revenues, beating top-and-bottom-line expectations.As we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q2 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne recurring theme in the Q2 earnings season has been the continued resilience and stability of the U.S. consumer. We heard this from the banks, the leisure and hospitality players, and consumer-facing digital operators.There is undoubtedly stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. Other issues, like the resumption of student loan payments, are seen as weighing on spending trends. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.We will hear more about that on the Walmart and Target earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods. But on the whole, consumer spending trends remained intact in 2023 Q2, and these results will reconfirm.Q2 Earnings ScorecardAs of Friday, August 11th, we have seen Q2 results from 457 S&amp;P 500 members, or 91.4% of the index’s total membership. The Q2 reporting cycle has now come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors.We have more than 300 companies reporting results this week, including 17 S&amp;P 500 members. The notable companies reporting this week include, besides the aforementioned Walmart and Target, include Home Depot, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, Deere &amp; Co.Total Q2 earnings for the 457 S&amp;P 500 members are down -9.5% from the same period last year on +0.48% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 65.2% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts nevertheless put the Q2 results from these 457 index members with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 457 index members in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Earnings Big Picture The chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q2, the following three quarters, and actual results for the preceding four quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the -8.2% decline for Q2 earnings on -0.2% lower revenues is the blended growth picture for the quarter, which combines the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies.As you can see in this chart, Q2 is on track to be the third quarter in a row of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. As noted earlier, a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector.Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -2.1% on +4.6% higher revenues.The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, 2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressures expected to be in the Energy, Medical, Basic Materials, and Construction sectors.With the earnings focus lately on the Tech sector, it is instructive to see how much distance has been covered on the margins front in this key sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tech Sector’s Earnings Outlook Reflects Improvement  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""What has been left out is discretionary goods, things like consumer electronics, apparel, home-related products.""Lasser outlines how investors will be eyeing the performance of big-ticket retail items and increased sales driven by price hikes. He shares his outlook on Walmart's omnichannel approach for shoppers and Target's inventory concerns.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: The focus is going to be on retail next week with some of the sector's biggest names set to report earnings results. Walmart, Target, and Home Depot are among the companies that will give us a closer look at the health of the consumer and some of the shopping trends.Here to break it all down, we want to bring in Michael Lasser, UBS retail analyst. Michael, it's great to see you. Before we get into individual names, just first give us your sense of the consumer because we've been talking about for months and months and months that the consumer has been so resilient. Is that going to be the case this earnings season?- I think this earnings season we're going to see a mixed picture of the consumer. The consumer has had to spend more money to buy basic necessities like food, household products given all the inflation that's happened over the last year. At the same time, the consumer has increasingly wanted to spend on things like vacations, concerts, going out to eat, and that's also been more expensive.What has been left out is discretionary goods. Things like consumer electronics, apparel, home-related products. And we are likely to see the composition of this spend in the upcoming reports of these retailers. Now, the question is, what happens in the back half of the year and in the next year as some of this excess savings work down, the labor market becomes a little less certain. And so I'm expecting mixed results and a cautious tone from some of these retailers as the pressures linger on the consumer.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, it feels like it's more of a continuation of some of the narrative that we've heard from some of these big-box retailers. You know, those like Target as well as Walmart over the last few quarters talking about consumers spending more on groceries less on big ticket items as well. What are you going to be looking for when they report next week in terms of where things are likely to go? I mean, to your point consumers are still spending, but it is services over goods.MICHAEL LASSER: Yeah. So here's a couple of things we're going to be looking for. Number one, is the pressure on those big ticket items, is it starting to stabilize? Meaning is it just not getting worse even though it might not be getting better. Because obviously, that would be a prelude to an eventual recovery in those big ticket discretionary items.Number two, a lot of these retailers because they report their sales in nominal dollars, they've been seeing significant growth simply from raising prices. So what is the outlook for seeing growth from either more people going to their stores buying more products while they're there because they're going to rely less on raising prices as a way to drive growth into the back half of the year? So those are going to be two critical areas to watch as we get into the reporting season over the next few weeks.SEANA SMITH: So Michael, Walmart is one of the names that you cover. It's been able-- it's been faring relatively well given some of the pressure that consumers have been under-- a number of consumers have been trading down. How do you think Walmart is then positioned in this environment?MICHAEL LASSER: I think Walmart is positioned really well. Not only because consumers have been trading into Walmart because Walmart is as good of a retailer as any to help consumers stretch their budgets, but also Walmart's been more effective at doing things like rolling out Walmart Plus to make it easier and more cost effective to do online shopping and delivery of online purchases.They've been expanding their assortment into more value-oriented products. I think all of those factors along with some price inflation, and the contribution from rapidly expanding demand of weight loss drugs, GLP-1 drugs, all of that's going to contribute to very strong sales for Walmart in the second quarter.The most likely case, though, is they take a prudently cautious outlook for the back half of the year. The stock is in a nice run. We think it's in the midst of a continued appreciation cycle. We like the stock. From here we would own it not only into the earnings report but also for the longer term as well.SEANA SMITH: How does that compare with somebody like Target? So Target has more of a lean to discretionary categories like home, consumer electronics, apparel. It also has less exposure to fresh food. So it's mix is going to act as a drag on its total performance in the quarter.And we expect that with that being said, it's been recovering from some of the inventory disposition that it incurred last year. Really the key for target here is what does the ongoing long-term profitability of this business look like? We think as the sales stabilize and it continues to execute its strategy, which is to make it easy to do business with Target, we're going to see that its profitability is much higher than where it is today. And as that comes into view, that's going to be very bullish for the stock.SEANA SMITH: Michael, retail shrink-- when we speak of Target, they were the one company that said that they could take up to a $500 million hit in its profits because of retail shrink. And we heard it from a number of Target competitors really across the retail landscape last quarter. Have retailers at all-- have they been able to mitigate some of this pressure, and what do you think that pressure then looks like still?MICHAEL LASSER: Well, so we think it's going to still be a source of pressure. We don't think it's going to get worse. We don't think it's going to get that much better. But shrink has proven to be cyclical over time, especially during difficult periods where the consumer is facing a lot of pressure. The consumer is more likely to engage in malicious acts, and that's in addition to some of the more cyclical challenges that have occurred with organized retail crime.Our view is that as we move into 2024, these retailers are going to act more aggressively, deploy more strategies to try and address the shrink. If that's not successful and it doesn't work, they're simply going to close some of these stores because it's not going to be economical to run those locations that are being most afflicted from this issue.It is a industry-wide issue, but we think it does get better eventually. And Target, as you rightfully mentioned, is the one that has the most leverage to the upside as shrink gets better.AKIKO FUJITA: One of many factors no question investors are going to be focused on when those results start to come in next week.MICHAEL LASSER: No doubt.AKIKO FUJITA: Michael Lasser, thanks so much for joining us today.MICHAEL LASSER: Have a wonderful weekend.]"

And first up, we got to start with GM and Ford, both under pressure amid labor contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers. As the September expiration date for the contracts approaches, fears of a strike are beginning to creep in. We saw that reflected not only today but really the weekly moves that we saw in both stocks here, Akiko.And I think the thought process is, at least the thinking along the lines of some of the analysts out there is that the workers, the unions might have the upper hand in this type of environment. Wells Fargo is out with a note saying that the expiring UAW contract on September 14 is the most imminent risk to GM and Ford, calling the demands audacious and really raising that risk of a strike.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, there's two-fold, right, Seana? On the one hand, there's the risk of a strike and how much that would cost to the carmakers if there is a work stoppage. There's also the realization that if they do reach some kind of contract, that's going to mean higher expenses. For these companies, you had that number out from Bloomberg this week saying that it would add more than $80 billion in expenses for each one of these American car companies.When you consider what exactly the UAW is asking for right now in their contracts, and you don't need to look further than UPS to understand where those higher costs are going to come from. They averted a strike, and yet they had expenses go up significantly as a result of the higher wages, more benefits, all of that.Story continuesSo it feels like when you look at these carmakers, there's a bit of a lose-lose situation. But certainly, investors are not looking for a strike here, but either way, looking at higher costs as a result of these negotiations. Shares of Walmart closing higher, locking in a fourth record close this month. The company also gearing up to report its quarterly results next week.Seana, we were talking to UBS' Michael Lasser earlier about the strength that Walmart has when you compare it to some of its competitors. There's a lot of expectation riding on these results in part because of Walmart's mix and where consumers are right now. You talked about Target not being a little more discretionary. Walmart in a stronger position when it comes to fresh foods, sort of these key items that consumers are going for right now, increasingly seeking out value. You could argue Walmart is in a stronger position in that space and certainly, higher expectations here going into next week's results.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. There certainly are higher expectations, especially on the heels of what we heard last quarter from these two companies, like you were just saying there, Akiko. Target, obviously, when you compare it to the position of Walmart, Walmart in a stronger position than Target just given Target's heavier reliance on some of those more discretionary items.But when it comes to Walmart and what we are expecting, Credit Suisse maintaining their outperform rating on the stock, also raising their price target to $180 this year. They are very confident just in terms of Walmart's positioning right now, what those returns will potentially look like.It was interesting though to me what we heard from Michael Lasser just about the outlook. He expects a cautious outlook here from Walmart. Despite the fact that he thinks they are going to be able to weather some of the downturn, some of the cautious consumer, at least in the coming months, he would not be surprised if we do get a cautious guidance here from Walmart given some of those macro pressures.All right. Also Chinese ADRs sliding today as concerns over China's real estate sector is coming to the forefront yet again. Country Garden issuing a profit warning, deepening fears over China's property sector, this coming two years after we had the Evergrande group's default. When you take a look at the losses across the board, Akiko, I know you're following this very closely, but really just highlights the troubling economy that China faces right now. The fact that we haven't seen this recovery pick up steam, like we initially anticipated. And obviously, some of that has to do with the massive weakness that we're seeing within the property sector.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah I mean, when you think about Country Garden the reason we're so focused on that is because that's the last of the big developers that have been able to avoid a default up until now. And when you think about this incredible growth that we have seen from China over the years, not over the last few years but over the years, it has been on the back of real estate. These developers taking on massive loads of debt to expand in a big way.And what we saw with Country Garden reporting saying they expected a loss of $7.6 billion over the first six months of the year, a lot of investors thinking back to what happened with Evergrande, and that has really brought back in the jitters there. You see Alibaba, JD.com, Baidu, all the big Chinese AVRs, they're pulling back in a big way. And by the way, Country Garden traded over in Hong Kong, seeing massive losses on the day on the back of these numbers.]"

In the second quarter of 2023, the company’s revenues increased 11.2% year over year to $1,072.4 million, driven by growth across all regions and channels. Its direct-to-consumer sales in the quarter surged 26% year-over-year.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company increased by 32.2% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 7.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCROXs acquisition of HEYDUDE, which sells lightweight, casual shoes and sandals for men, women and children, has added value to its fast-growing footwear business. Crocs believes that HEYDUDE’s consumer-insight-driven casual, comfortable and lightweight products complement its existing product portfolio. The acquisition has added to the company’s digital penetration, as HEYDUDE already has a strong online presence.HEYDUDE brand’s second-quarter revenues advanced 3% year over year to $239.4 million. For 2023, revenues related to the HEYDUDE buyout are likely to grow in the range of 14%-18% on a reported basis. Management remains optimistic about HEYDUDE, which is expected to achieve its sales target of $1 billion this year.Driven by these factors, management raised its guidance for 2023. Revenues are anticipated to grow 12.5-14.5% (from the previously projected 11-14%) to $4,000-$4,065 million. Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of $11.83-$12.22 per share, up from the previous guidance of $11.17-$11.73. The adjusted operating margin is projected to be 27.5%, higher than the previously anticipated range of 26-27%.For third-quarter 2023, revenues are expected to grow 3-5% to $1,013-$1,034 million.

The persistence of this trend may weigh on the company’s profitability in the upcoming quarters.Although inflationary pressure has somewhat eased, rising interest rates have also been a concern for Crocs.

Also, SPB shares grew more than 4% before the trading session on Aug 11. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Q3 HighlightsThe company reported adjusted earnings of 75 cents per share, up 39% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents. This upside is mainly attributable to higher adjusted EBITDA and a lower outstanding share.Spectrum Brands' net sales fell 10% year over year to $735.5 million and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $781 million. Adverse foreign currency impacts of $3.5 million acted as a drag. Organic net sales declined 9.7%. The downside was mainly due to retailer inventory management strategies and slower category POS, offset by positive pricing.The gross profit decreased 4.5% year over year to $263.5 million due to reduced volume. The metric came ahead of our estimate of $260.2 million. Meanwhile, the gross margin expanded 210 bps to 35.8%, driven by increased pricing, cost improvements and favorable mix.SG&amp;A expenses fell 14.9% to $218.1 million and came below our estimate of $242.9 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A expenses contracted 170 bps to 29.6%.The company’s operating loss was $124.7 million against the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $38.7 million due to a goodwill impairment of $111.1 million and intangible asset impairment of $53.7 million, offset by lower distribution costs, fixed-cost-reduction efforts, and reduced project spend on restructuring, optimization and strategic transaction initiatives.Adjusted EBITDA advanced 23% to $98.5 million in the fiscal third quarter and came ahead of our estimate of $89.3 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 360 bps to 13.4%, driven by lower distribution costs, fixed-cost-reduction initiatives and positive pricing impacts, partly offset by the reduced volume.Story continuesSegmental PerformanceSales in the Home &amp; Personal Care segment decreased 16% to $277 million due to a category decline from lower demand, particularly in kitchen appliances, and continued retailer inventory management in North America. The metric came ahead of our estimate of $275.4 million. Excluding the $4.3-million impact of adverse currency rates, organic net sales for the segment fell 14.7%.The segment's adjusted EBITDA surged 216.7% to $11.4 million. Meanwhile, the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 300 bps year over year to 4.1%, driven by cost improvement initiatives, positive pricing and ocean freight declines. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency in LATAM and reduced volume.The Global Pet Care segment's sales moved down 6.2% year over year to $272.3 million due to the continued softness in the global aquatics category. Also, its companion animals category performed well in the EMEA and Latin America regions but declined in North America due to aggressive portfolio management, which led to the exit several non-strategic categories. The metric lagged our estimate of $294.4 million. Excluding the $0.8-million impact of unfavorable foreign currency, organic sales fell 6.4%.The segment's adjusted EBITDA grew 31% to $53.6, while the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 560 bps year over year to 19.7%, driven by lower distribution costs, positive pricing, savings from the prior year’s cost-reduction initiatives and additional cost-reduction actions, partly offset by lower volumes.The Home &amp; Garden segment's sales declined 6% to $186.6 million due to lower-than-expected replenishment orders for the pest control category, lower-than-expected POS and adverse weather conditions. On the flip side, cleaning products’ sales witnessed low-single-digit growth, but the category POS was drab due to the dismal demand for cleaning products post COVID-19 outbreak. The metric lagged our estimate of $204.3 million.The segment's adjusted EBITDA of $38.6 million decreased 9.8% from $42.8 million in the prior-year quarter due to a sales decline and continued inflation, offset by positive pricing, benefits of the prior year’s fixed-cost restructuring and operational cost reductions from cost improvement initiatives. The adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 90 bps to 20.7%.Other FinancialsAs of Jul 2, 2023, the company’s cash balance was $2,930 million, with an outstanding debt of $2,101 million.

G-III Apparel has also been making progress on rightsizing the inventory. With the normalization of port congestion and lead times, management has adjusted the warehouse space appropriately. This trend is likely to continue throughout the year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement has announced a new licensing agreement for the Halston brand. The company has entered into a 25-year agreement with Xcel Brands to design and manufacture all categories, with the choice to buy the brand at the end of the licensing term. Halston is an American heritage brand with a legacy of glamorous designs across a range of price points. The first deliveries are likely to be in 2024 fall.We note that G-III Apparel has numerous growth opportunities including the Spring 2024 repositioning and expansion of the Donna Karan label, and a new long-term license for the Nautica brand. Nautica is available in nearly 1300 freestanding stores and shops globally and boasts a sturdy digital presence in over 30 countries.The company is on track to produce Nautica products across several categories starting with jeanswear. This includes jeans and a complete range of corresponding lifestyle products. The company will later expand in a phased manner with other categories like sportswear, suit separates and dresses.Management is on track with the development of the Nautica and Donna Karan brands. For Nautica, the company is working on bringing the Spring 2024 jeans line to life, while for Donna Karan, it is leveraging the brand’s classic, contemporary, and elevated feel and widening its appeal to a broader consumer base. Furthermore, the company has been maximizing its omnichannel opportunities and leveraging data for a while.Given all the aforesaid tailwinds, we believe G-III Apparel will continue to perform well on the bourses.Story continuesEye These Solid Picks TooSome other top-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, lululemon athletica LULU and Ralph Lauren RL.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), at present.

ROST is scheduled to release its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 17. The off-price apparel and home accessories retailer is likely to have witnessed revenue and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.7 billion, indicating growth of 3% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. For fiscal second-quarter earnings, the consensus mark of $1.15 per share suggests growth of 3.6% from the year-ago quarter's reported number. The consensus mark for earnings has moved up by a penny in the past seven days.In the last reported quarter, Ross Stores delivered an earnings surprise of 2.8%. In the trailing four quarters, it delivered an earnings beat of 11.5%, on average.Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoss Stores, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteRoss Stores has been benefiting from robust customer demand and improved traffic trends in the retail industry. Sales in the fiscal second quarter are likely to have benefited from broad-based growth across merchandise categories and regions. Gains at the core business, driven by consumers' continued focus on value and the company’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers, bode well.Our model predicts comparable store sales to be flat year over year, driven by strength across its namesake and dd's DISCOUNTS business formats.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, Ross Stores was optimistic about its second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance. The company expects comps to remain flat year over year for second-quarter fiscal 2023, while total sales are forecast to increase 1-4% year over year. The bottom line is envisioned to be $1.07-$1.14 per share for the fiscal second quarter.Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans, which are likely to have aided the top line. The company's store expansion efforts have been focused on continually increasing penetration in existing and new markets. The second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance is anticipated to have gained from the company’s return to normal store opening targets. Gains from new stores are expected to get reflected in ROST’s sales for the fiscal second quarter.However, Ross Stores has been witnessing the effects of the ongoing financial pressures on dd’s DISCOUNTS’ lower-income customer base and increased markdowns. The escalating inflationary pressures are likely to have affected dd's DISCOUNTS’ revenues and comps in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, Ross Stores’ cost of goods sold is likely to have witnessed the continued impacts of lower merchandise margins, unfavorable timing of pack-away-related costs and increased markdowns. Unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses and deleverage from its new distribution center are expected to have led to higher distribution costs.Additionally, increased incentive compensation expenses are likely to have led to higher SG&amp;A expenses, affecting the operating margin performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Our model predicts the cost of goods sold to increase 2.3% year over year to $3,476.8 million in the fiscal second quarter. As a percentage of sales, we expect SG&amp;A expenses to increase 120 basis points to 15.8% in the fiscal second quarter. In dollar terms, SG&amp;A expenses are expected to increase 11.5% year over year to $743.8 million.Consequently, we estimate the operating margin to contract 120 bps to 10.1% in the to-be-reported quarter. On a dollar basis, operating profit is expected to decline 7.9% year over year in the fiscal second quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ross Stores this time around.

196,c2ade182-24bd-3546-b9e0-262857106487,RF,2023-08-12,Regions Financial's (NYSE:RF) Upcoming Dividend Will Be Larger Than Last Year's,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financials-nyse-rf-upcoming-120242094.html,1691841762,STORY,['RF'],"[The board of Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.24 on the 2nd of October, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the dividend yield to 4.7%, which shareholders will be pleased with.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Regions Financial's stock price has increased by 31% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield. Check out our latest analysis for Regions Financial Regions Financial's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable.Regions Financial has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Based on Regions Financial's last earnings report, the payout ratio is at a decent 34%, meaning that the company is able to pay out its dividend with a bit of room to spare.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 1.2% over the next 3 years. Fortunately, analysts forecast the future payout ratio to be 42% over the same time horizon, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendRegions Financial Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.04, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.96. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 37% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Story continuesThe Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Regions Financial has grown earnings per share at 15% per year over the past five years. Regions Financial definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Regions Financial Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Regions Financial is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. As an example, we've identified 1 warning sign for Regions Financial that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

It has completed testing a new way to allow users to pay the fees, known as ""gas fees,"" in fiat currency with their credit card, the company wrote in a blog post on Thursday.The payments company said blockchain technology could “shape the future of money movement” and has gained significant adoption in the past few years. However, facilitating transactions on-chain remains too complex for most users.Every time a user conducts a transaction on Ethereum, he or she must pay a gas fee. That includes sending and receiving ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, over the blockchain. Managing a user's ETH balance to cover those costs is “burdensome,” Visa said in the blog post. Eliminating the complexity could make blockchain-based transactions more accessible and user-friendly, Visa added.“When comparing the complex nature of blockchain transactions with the simplicity of fiat-based payment transactions supported by the Visa network, it becomes evident that improvement is needed,” Visa said.To bridge the gap, Visa suggests leveraging Ethereum’s ERC-4337, the current standard that enables smart contracts on the blockchain to serve as wallets via a process called ""account abstraction,"" and a paymaster contract — a smart-contract account that can sponsor gas fees on behalf of the user. The service would allow users to use a Visa card to pay directly for gas fees.Testing of this process was performed on the Ethereum Goerli ""testnet,"" a test network for Ethereum.Visa said merchants or decentralized applications could run their paymaster system or use an existing wallet to make transactions easier. The paymaster service providers could also offer a choice of card-based gas fee payment, among other options.The payments company has been active in the crypto sector for a while, experimenting with different projects. In February, Visa looked into how to convert digital assets into fiat payments.Read more: Visa's Crypto Strategy Remains Intact Despite Crypto Winter]"

The expansion of the partnership is likely to enable the companies to enhance their offerings and reach huge markets in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.The move is expected to channel additional investments to further development of the suite of B2B payment solutions. It is also likely to provide better control and security and reduce the risk of fraud for their corporate customers. The move can eliminate the barriers to a more digitized payments environment while accelerating the growth of virtual payments products.The move comes at an opportune time when the global travel market is continuing to witness growth. Visa Commercial Pay’s focus on digital payment solutions in the travel sector is likely to position it for increasing profits in the coming days.

Economists polled by Refinitiv had expected a 0.7% gain.Though traders broadly expect the Federal Reserve to refrain from tightening credit conditions for the rest of the year, bets for no rate hike in September slipped to 88.5% from 90% before the data landed.""The PPI data shows that the inflation monster is still lingering but investors can see progress in the things that come under CPI,"" said David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at TradeStation.Yield on the two-year treasury note, that moves in line with near-term interest rate expectations, climbed to 4.88%.

Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 29% of total circulation and subscription revenues in the quarter as compared with 23% in the prior year.Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were more than 4.6 million, reflecting a 5% increase from the prior year, primarily due to the growth in streaming subscribers driven by BINGE and Kayo.

Todays conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Michael FlorinThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.Story continuesRobert J. ThomsonThank you, Mike. Before we discuss the results for the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2023, I'd like to acknowledge that we have now completed a decade of the new News Corp's existence. So this is surely an appropriate moment to reflect on our profound transformation, a transformation faithful to the company's founding principles. Consider the then and now. Our revenue base has changed fundamentally and expanded dramatically. News and Information Services, accounted for 72% of total revenues in fiscal 2014, which included News America Marketing and Dow Jones. By fiscal 2023, News Media was 23%, and revitalized Dow Jones segment was 22%. And Digital real estate comprised 5% of total revenues 10 years ago, and that has tripled to over 15% this past year, which includes the acquisition of Move, where revenues have more than doubled.Subscription Video services revenues increased from 6% of News Corp's total to 20%, bolstered by the consolidation and control of Foxtel, a business renewed and Foxtel's imminent completion of a refinancing is expected to facilitate repayments of our outstanding shareholder loans beginning this fiscal year. Candidly, since our reincarnation, we have increasingly digital recurring revenues, higher margins, significantly more free cash flow, robust finances and bright prospects for long-term growth and value creation for all our shareholders. A few facts to demonstrate our digital scale today. Based on our June metrics, we had 79 million unique visitors at Dow Jones, 159 million at the Sun, 74 million at realtor.com, 21 million at Housing.com in India and 145 million at the increasingly influential New York Post. And that digital momentum is surely gathering pace in the age of generative AI. Along with this relentless focus on digitization, we have been intent on simplifying the company and heightening our cost consciousness. That cost discipline was clearly evident during a year that had a complicated plot line for books, while digital real estate was naturally inevitably affected by the interest rate hikes, which appear to be plateauing in the U.S. I would like to pay sincere tribute to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and our directors who have been steadfast in their strategic support and all our employees and our loyal insightful investors. Thanks to their collective committed efforts, News Corp achieved its 3 strongest fiscal years ever in the last 3 fiscal years, 2021, 2022 and 2023. In fact, fiscal '23 was our second most profitable year following fiscal '22 despite the difficult macro conditions in a couple of core segments. And our fourth quarter profitability was significantly higher than last year. There have certainly been fundamental changes in the media landscape. We have led the quest for appropriate compensation for content from the big digital platforms. And that quest begun publicly in 2007 when I testified before the House of Lords about the challenges for publishers and society in the Internet age has entered a new fascinating phase with the rise of generative AI. Clearly, negotiations are well underway with the relevant companies. And once again, News Corp hopes to set precedents that benefit creators, publishers and journalists around the globe. It is crucial for our societies that AI is replete with EI. That recomposition does not lead to the decomposition of creativity and integrity. We have been characteristically candid about the AI challenge to publishers and to intellectual property. It is essentially a triptych. In the first instance, our content is being harvested and scraped and otherwise ingested to train AI engines. Ingestion should not lead to indigestion. Secondly, individual stories are being serviced in specific searches. And thirdly, original content can be synthesized and presented as distinct when it is actually an extracting of our editorial essence. These super snippets, distilling the effort and insight of great journalism are potentially designed so the reader will never visit a new site, thus, fatally undermining journalism and damaging our societies. It is reassuring that the prescient executives at the largest digital companies can see these complexities and understand that our shared responsibilities extend far beyond the commercial that generative AI cannot be degenerative. That we are paving a platform for future generations and that we will be collectively held to account and not just by accountants. From the philosophical to the functional, there is no doubt that AI articulations will affect most sections of most companies, whether it be customer service, subscription management, chatbots, chit-chat bots, text to audio and audio to video. Experiences, efficiencies will be exponential. And we are absolutely clear in our company, there must be a confluence of the technological, the commercial and the culture. Last earnings, I mentioned the plight of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, unjustly incarcerated by Russia for being a journalist, seeking facts, seeking the truth both the journal and the U.S. government vehemently deny the allegations against it. Evan has now spent almost 5 months in prison, and we thank the many thoughtful people from all around the globe who have rallied to his course and sought his release. And we thank those who are continuing to press determinedly for his emancipation and providing support to his courageous family. Turning now to our results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023. The aforementioned macroeconomic factors, that is inflation, supply chain complications and volting interest rates, along with volatile foreign exchange rates patently presented challenges, some of which are more ephemeral than internal. Nonetheless, we still saw significant progress across several segments. And thanks to our digital and international strategic focus and acute cost consciousness including the announced 5% headcount reduction, which we expect to yield more than $160 million in annual gross savings. Not only was this fiscal year, the second best ever in terms of profits, we believe we are poised for greater growth in the years ahead. As for the fourth quarter, revenues were over $2.43 billion, 9% lower year-over-year. Though a majority of that decline is attributable to foreign exchange rates and an extra week last year, a 53rd week to balance out the multiyear calendar. Mathematically, that 1 extra week accounts for almost half of the difference and will obviously not be a factor in the current year. Profitability in the quarter rose 8%, which is especially notable in that it comes after a 50% rise a year earlier. We are building on our positive performances even when the headwinds are blustery. Full year revenues were $ 9.879 billion, down 5% on our record prior year. And total segment EBITDA was over $1.4 billion, 15% lower, though still the second highest profits recorded for the new News Corp. Dow Jones posted its highest profitability for both the quarter and the full year since we acquired the company, helped by impressive results in the professional information business. In fact, taking a step back Dow Jones has doubled it's profitability in the past 4 years. And for the first time, Dow Jones was the highest contributor of profits across all of News Corp in fiscal 2023 as we continue to develop the higher-margin B2B offerings. We are focused on Dow Jones as a pillar of News Corp's future growth with significant value appreciation for shareholders. Dow Jones is nearing an important threshold, with the lucrative B2B business expected to be the highest contributor to profitability in fiscal 2024 and a key driver for future margin expansion. Dow Jones has been bolstered over the past year by the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical market analytics and by continuing double-digit growth of risk and compliance. It is worth noting that risk and compliance revenues have risen sixfold over the past decade. We believe prospects remain decidedly bright as the corporate imperative to minimize risk and maximize compliance, grows in an ever more complex regulatory regime. We believe the energy transition is an enormous global opportunity for Opus, and we will capitalize on it through new products, the establishment of compelling benchmarks and the generation of must-have data, pricing and analytics, whether it be for fossil fuels, hydrogen, solar, lithium, cobalt, EVs or carbon credits and offsets. The industry relies on Opus for pricing transparency which is critical to day-by-day decision-making in a market that is undergoing massive transformation. Dow Jones digital subscription growth accelerated in the second half. partly helped by bundling of our products to capitalize on our clients' needs for a sophisticated market analysis and analytics. We want to channel market watch readers to WSJ, then to Barron's and Investors Business Daily and from there to our specialist business products. That is a pathway to profits for the company. Moreover, we are increasing our international digital focus for the Wall Street Journal, which currently has only 12% of subscriptions outside the U.S., where there is much untapped potential. Subscription Video Services reported adjusted revenue and profit growth, which excludes currency impact for the second straight year and also for the fourth quarter, a remarkable turnaround from the recent past. We have long-term rights to the key Australian sports and the prime international sports for Australians and have created a model that streamers around the world are now trying to emulate. Our streaming revenue growth again outpaced broadcast declines in both Q4 and the full year, with paid subscribers scaling at a double-digit rate to nearly 3.1 million. So we are particularly confident about Foxtel's future and our optionality given the imminent completion of our refinancing. We were asked frequently in the past how much more capital we would need to commit to Foxtel. But the question now is how much cash we will receive in coming years. REA continued to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges in the Australian housing market. So we do see an easing of those challenges as the interest rate cycle peaks. Home prices have again started to increase, and the auction completion rate crossed 70% in June, up from 55% in the prior year. REA's audience share against its nearest competitor continued to expand to north of 3.5x in June. While visits to the site have expanded year-over-year for 4 consecutive months. REA did benefit from product price increases linked to improvements in the quality of those products while India remains a source of ongoing potential, given that Housing.com is already the market leader in a country on a positive economic trajectory with a rapidly expanding middle class. In the U.S., we have new leadership at Move, operator realtor.com. Move experienced much success under David Doctorow and broadened its offerings with the acquisitions of Opcity, UpNest and Avail. We sincerely thank David for his positive contribution, which will resonate for years to come, Damian Eales brings vast digital experience, a fiercely competitive spirit and much knowledge of how to leverage News Corp's powerful U.S. platforms. Whether that be the New York Post or the Wall Street Journal or Barron's to build the brand and expand market share. Damian has just returned from Australia, where the Realtor team spent time at REA and the creative collaboration between the 2 companies will certainly intensify. Scale is crucial. And to put our scale in perspective, based on June Comscore data, Realtors valuable and engaged audience is well over 2x of that of Homes.com. Not only do we have scale in residential sales, we believe that we can continue to monetize that audience successfully. For HarperCollins and for other book publishers, Q4 and fiscal '23 generally was a challenging period with the post-COVID market resetting, logistical issues at Amazon and acute inflationary pressures. Some particular signs of success were Joanna Gaines Magnolia Table Volume 3 and Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt, and we have reason for optimism in the near future with books like Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, The Collector by Daniel Silva. And in the U.K., TV, Big Adventures on the Small Screen by Peter Kay.In Q2, we are looking forward to the next Pioneer Woman Cooks by Ree Drummond and The Little Liar by Mitch Albom. In News Media, advertising trends vary distinctly by geography, with the U.K. and the U.S. performing best in the quarter. In the U.K., the Sun had a successful year with digital outpacing print ads again in the fourth quarter and for the full year. This strength was accentuated by the year-over-year growth of the Sun in the U.S. which reported a substantial surge in page views and even higher yields than the successful U.K. side. The Times and Sunday Times also hit 565,000 digital subscriptions at the end of June, an 11% increase, underscoring the strength of their journalism and the global potential of the brand. News Corp Australia achieved almost 1.1 million digital subscriptions, an increase of 10%. News.com.au was the leading news website in Australia according to the Ipsos rankings, while the Australian was also in the top 10. In the U.S., the New York Post reported another year of strong profits after decades, if not centuries, of endless losses. As I mentioned, the Papers improved commercial fortunes have been accompanied by growing influence in New York, Washington and beyond. As the papers Founder, Alexander Hamilton, safely observed those who stand for nothing fall for everything. In a fiscal year affected by the reverberations of war, inflation, interest rate hikes, supply chain disruption and other macroeconomic challenges and in a business inevitably impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations News Corp is proud to report its second most profitable year since its reincarnation a decade ago. Our teams have been tested and have clearly passed that exacting test. We ended the year on an upswing with the company returning to profit growth in the quarter with inflation showing signs of abating, interest rates plateauing and incipient signs of stability in the housing market, we have sound reasons for optimism. All specious macro conditions will surely work to the benefit of a company that has become more digital, more global and with more recurring revenues in higher-margin segments. We have navigated the sometimes perilous media waters adroitly and are particularly proud of our providence, a providence based on commitment, curiosity and integrity. We look forward with a sense of genuine of tangible excitement in the potential of our people and our businesses, and we remain utterly determined to deliver positive results for our customers, our employees and most certainly for our shareholders. I will now pass you to our erudite CFO, Susan Panuccio, who will provide more insight into our financial coordinates.Susan Lee PanuccioThank you, Robert. Our second half results show marked improvement from the first half of the year, with fourth quarter profitability up year-over-year, highlighting the diversity and durability of our revenue streams and our ongoing cost efficiencies as we navigated the ever-changing macro conditions, supply chain pressures and currency headwinds. As the company continues to transition to digital. Digital revenues now comprise over half of the company's fiscal 2023 revenues. We have also transformed the revenue base away from cyclical advertising revenues to one that is much more recurring and subscription base with strong growth prospects. We have made strategic acquisitions that we believe have fundamentally strengthened the company. The acquisitions of OPIS, CMA, HMH, Mortgage Choice and IBD during fiscal 2021 and 2022 have essentially replaced the revenues from News America Marketing, providing a much stronger base for long-term growth. The company has changed and evolved since 2013 and is well positioned for future success. We have maintained a very healthy balance sheet while we strengthened the asset base, transform digitally generated healthy free cash flow and continue to improve our operating efficiencies. Turning to our financials. I will focus on the fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down 9% year-over-year, which was heavily impacted by the $110 million or 4% negative impact related to the extra week last year and the $72 million or 3% impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Impressively, total segment EBITDA was $341 million, up 8% year-over-year despite very difficult year-over-year comparisons and weak trading conditions at HarperCollins. Margins improved by over 2 percentage points to 14%. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues declined 7% compared to the prior year, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 2% versus the prior year. Both revenues and total segment EBITDA were also negatively impacted by the extra week last year. Adjusted revenue and total segment EBITDA did not exclude that impact. Earnings per share in the quarter were a loss of $0.01 compared to income of $0.19 in the prior year. The current quarter reflects $85 million of restructuring and impairment charges, mostly related to our company-wide headcount reduction that we communicated on the last earnings call and an $81 million noncash write-down in equity losses of affiliates related to REA's investment in Property Guru. The prior year income of $0.19 benefited from $149 million tax benefit. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.14 in the quarter compared to $0.37 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $369 million, down 17% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic pressures, a negative impact of $15 million or 4% from foreign currency fluctuations, and $14 million or 3% of negative impact from the extra week last year. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues decreased 14%. Segment EBITDA declined 11% to $108 million, impacted by lower revenues, partially offset by the lower discretionary costs, compensation and broker commissions. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 5%. REA revenues were $223 million, which declined 11% on a reported basis or down 5% on a constant currency basis. The revenue decline was due to the impact of lower national listings and a decrease in financial services revenue driven by lower settlement activity. New buy listings for the fourth quarter were down 18% year-over-year with the higher-yielding metro areas of Sydney and Melbourne showing improvement each month of the quarter, yet ended down 17% and 16%, respectively. Those declines were partially offset by the annual price increases in the residential and commercial businesses increased uptake in premium products, including Premier Plus, favorable death penetration and continued strong performance from REA India, which maintained its audience leadership. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. At Move, revenues were $146 million, down 24% compared to the prior year, which reflects the $14 million or 7% negative impact related to the absence of the extra week. Excluding the extra week impact, revenue declined 17%, similar to the third quarter results with yield optimization in the lead generation products, partially offsetting lower lead and transaction volume. Lead volumes moderated to down 14% year-over-year compared to a decline of 30% in the third quarter while Realtor's average monthly unique users declined 20% from the prior year to $74 million in the fourth quarter based on internal metrics yet up from $72 million in the third quarter. We remain focused on driving both usage and Engagement through continued product enhancements And improvements to SEO while expanding our core adjacencies of seller, rentals and new homes.Turning to the switch and Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 4% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year, the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 23% in the prior year. OTT revenue growth again more than offset broadcast revenue declines, benefiting from both increased subscribers and price increases at Kayo and BINGE. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group improved to over $4.6 million at quarter end, up 5% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers approached $3.1 million, increasing 14% versus the prior year and accounted for approximately 66% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Binge continued to expand advertising inventory on the basic product generating both modest incremental revenues and some upgrade activity to the higher tiered subscription offerings. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down only 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down more than 260 basis points year-over-year to 11.1%, the lowest level since fiscal 2016, while broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over AUD 84 Foxtel announced a price rise beginning in July across some of the broadcast tiers, the first since fiscal 2019, which will benefit the fiscal 2024 results. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $78 million was down 4% versus the prior year, but was up 4% on an adjusted basis despite higher programming costs, mostly related to contractual escalators across key sports rights. On the product front, following the successful growth in streaming, the business will be launching a streaming aggregation device leveraging the Sky glass technology. Expectation is for a commercial launch later in fiscal 2024 and we will keep you updated on our progress. Moving to Dow Jones, Dow Jones had another strong quarter with revenues of $546 million, down 3%, which includes the negative impact of $40 million or 7% related to the absence of the extra week from last year. We lapped the Opus acquisition in March and CMA in June. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 3 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represent over 79% of total revenues, up over 2 percentage points from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6% but would have delivered a modest improvement, excluding the extra week. We are continuing to see strong momentum in our professional information business with revenues rising 10% year-over-year, benefiting from the continued integration of Opus and CMA coupled with strong revenues from risk and compliance. Results were partly offset by the extra week last year, which led to a $14 million or 8% negative impact on the performance. Excluding the extra week, PIB revenues grew 18%. PIB revenues this quarter accounted for 37% of segment revenues. And while we don't disclose specific margins, PIB margins are higher than the overall Dow Jones margin and are contributing strongly to segment EBITDA. Underscoring the uniqueness and durability of the Dow Jones asset mix. Risk &amp; Compliance revenues rose 10% despite the extra week in the prior year and continued to grow at a high teens rate on a like-for-like basis. While 60% of the customers are in the financial services sector, the fastest growth is now coming from corporates with demand driven by the anti-money laundering financial corruption and ESG screening and monitoring products. Retention remains over 90%. Opus and CMA's revenue performance remained robust, benefiting from price escalators, new products and new customers. Retention rates for Opus and CMA subscription products remain in the mid-90s, which is underpinning the transformation of Dow Jones revenue base. Circulation revenues declined 6% due to the absence of the extra week lower print volume and weakness at IBD, as we noted in the third quarter. Excluding the extra week impact of $17 million or 7%, circulation revenues were up 1% year-over-year, which is slightly higher than the third quarter rate. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions grew 12% year-over-year or by $163,000 sequentially, with the year-over-year rate improving from last quarter. Advertising revenues declined 14% to $100 million and accounted for 18% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, with digital down 10% and print down 18%. Excluding the negative impact from the absence of the extra week of $9 million or 8%, the decline rate moderated from the third quarter to down 6%. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 25% to $133 million as cost growth moderated from the first half. Margins improved to 24%, up from 19% last year. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter increased 17%, a notable improvement over the third quarter and the full year performance. At Book Publishing, both HarperCollins and the industry more broadly faced challenging headwinds in the quarter, revenues fell 13% to $446 million, which included approximately $20 million or 4% of negative impact from the absence of the extra week. Consumer demand slowed in the fourth quarter more than we initially expected, leading to lower frontlist sales and higher returns, particularly in Christian Publishing and General books. Most of the weakness was in North America. Segment EBITDA declined 66% year-over-year to $16 million, a 4% segment EBITDA margin. Segment EBITDA was impacted by the weak top line performance as well as higher-than-normal levels of royalty write-offs due to the underperformance of certain titles further compressing profit margins. Despite some unusual headwinds, we are seeing moderation in freight and manufacturing costs, while headcount reduction initiatives are expected to exceed the 5% target. The backlist represented 59% of revenues for the quarter, up 3 points from last year but down slightly from Q3. Digital sales declined 10% this quarter, mostly driven by lower e-book sales and accounted for 25% of consumer sales, up from 24% last year. On an adjusted basis, revenues fell 13% and segment EBITDA fell 17%. Turning to News Media. Revenues were $571 million, down 9%, primarily due to the absence of the extra week, which negatively impacted revenues by $36 million or 6% and the impact from foreign currency of $18 million or 3%. Adjusted revenues declined 7%. And Advertising declined around 15%, reflecting a $15 million or 6% negative impact related to the absence of the extra week and a $6 million or 2% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact from the extra week in currency, advertising revenues declined approximately 7% due to weaknesses at News Australia, which was impacted by last year's federal election and some softness in real estate and retail. News U.K. and New York Post were relatively stable versus the prior year. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 7% due to the absence of the extra week negatively impacting revenues by $19 million or 6% and at a $9 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Excluding the extra week and currency impact, circulation and subscription revenues rose 2% and with growth driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and double-digit subscriber growth across News Australia and, The Times, and The Sunday Times. Segment EBITDA of $45 million rose 36% due to a 12% decline in cost driven by ongoing cost saving initiatives and lower costs related to Talk TV and other digital investments. Adjustment segment EBITDA rose 42%. Turning to the outlook. Market trends remain mixed geographically. That said, we have taken aggressive action over the years to improve our asset base including a shift to more recurring and digital revenues, coupled with strong cost initiatives and focused reinvestment in our core pillars. We still expect some inflationary pressures, but are hopeful that they will be at a more modest rate. We exited the fiscal fourth quarter with a return to total segment EBITDA growth, and we hope to see improvements in fiscal 2024. Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for July declined 5%. REA should benefit from double-digit residential yield growth as price increases have been successfully implemented. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, while we anticipate improvements in lead volume and transactions across the full year, they will likely remain challenging in the short term. We also expect higher marketing spend compared to the fourth quarter, together with ongoing investment in adjacencies, which we will balance with cost reductions. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn as we complete the migration of customers from cable in the first half. We expect modestly higher expenses for the full year driven by sports rights and product investment, which will be more weighted to the first half. We expect full year CapEx and profitability will be relatively stable in local currency. At Dow Jones, we hope to see improvement in advertising declines, but as is typical, visibility is limited. We also expect to see continued strong growth from PIB. We expect modestly higher overall expenses in the first quarter and for the full year in contrast to the fourth quarter. In Book Publishing, HarperCollins in the industry exhibited more volatility last year than normal. That said, July was encouraging, with a return to revenue growth, EBITDA margins lifting from the fourth quarter lows, and prior year comparisons are easing. At News Media, July advertising trends remain mixed geographically. We expect Talk TV costs will be similar, if not lower than the prior year in local currency. We have also seen moderating newsprint cost pressures in the U.K. We expect CapEx in fiscal 2024 to be moderately higher than in fiscal 2023, primarily due to digital reinvestment. That being said, our CapEx came in notably lower than we expected this fiscal year, and we will be monitoring it closely with respect to macro and business conditions as we did during the current year. We expect to generate strong cash flows and expect to return a high percentage of shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.David KarnovskyMaybe Susan, just on the cost initiatives. I don't know if there's a way you could frame how much of that was a contributor in the quarter. And then I think last earnings, you stated you thought the majority of the benefit would come through in the fiscal first quarter. Is that still the case? And then just on other segment EBITDA that was better sequentially. Is that from the cost savings and should we think about that line as sustainable?Susan Lee PanuccioThanks, David. Look, I think we did have a really good quarter in Q4 in relation to the cost savings, and that certainly helped some of the segments, particularly News Media. You can see that coming through in the results. And yes, I did say last quarter that we would expect to see the full benefit coming through into fiscal 2024. I think that still is the case as we sit here today. We do expect to exceed that $160 million of gross cost savings from the 5% headcount reduction.But I would note, as we go into 2024, we will have some inflationary pressures related to wages, newsprint prices and manufacturing costs, and we will continue with our digital reinvestment initiatives across the various businesses. So that number quoted was gross cost savings, and that will help offset those increases in investments. Just in relation to the other segment, there are a couple of things going on. We had the NAM settlement, the legal fees in the quarter last year. So we got the benefit of that in this quarter. We also had lower bonus accruals coming through in this year than what we did relative to the prior year. I think if you want to think about the next year, I'd probably have a look at the Q3 rate as sort of an indicative performance for going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital.Alan Steven GouldRobert, I've got 2 actually. On the generative AI, can you give us an indication of this consortium? Are you in a consortium, what the process is? Is there any legislative movement? And secondly, can you give some discussion on Simon &amp; Schuster. I realize that they have one offer that could be very productive, but it does seem like the multiple was quite expensive.Robert J. ThomsonYes, Alan. Look, first of all, on AI, you're right by instinct that this is an important moment in the history of news and knowledge with commercial and social implications and a profound impact on creativity and integrity. If fake news and deep fakes are a concern, the potential for sophisticated forgeries for counterfed content is almost endless. And separately, generative AI has the potential to recycle itself in what you might call, endless perfidious permutations. And that's why the provenance of the archival base is so crucial and why refreshing daily weekly with incremental improvements is imperative. So the potential is enormous, but garbage in, garbage out and garbage all about. We've invested billions of dollars in knowledge creation, actually tens of billions of dollars. And that content certainly has a value in this editorial epoch. For almost 2 decades, we've genuinely led the digital debate about Providence, which is echoed in Washington and London, Brussels and Canberra and Tokyo and Rome. For us, what gives me confidence for our company and our community, is that the leaders of the largest digital companies are clearly sincerely focused on the issue. They understand our collective responsibility, and we are actively individually engaged in fruitful discussions. I can't be more specific at this moment. but we see a positive financial result through consensual negotiation, not through litigation. We would like to reward journalists, not lawyers. As for Simon &amp; Schuster, normally, we don't speculate on speculation about M&amp;A. But candidly, as you intimate, we wouldn't be prepared to go that high, given that, in our case, you could reasonably expect 18 months of scrupulous scrutiny by the antitrust authorities with all the related legal costs and the financial opportunity cost. We obviously have great respect for the company and resources. But given the regulatory risk, we were quietly hoping that, frankly, Simon &amp; Schuster would be remanded and that we would get the company for a bargain. But it obviously didn't end up in the Barnes &amp; Noble bargain Ben.OperatorOur next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.Kane HannanJust on Foxtel, should we still think about the 5 million subs, $3 billion revenue target you guys set out for next year, I think back at the Investor Day? And just given those CapEx comments, I mean do we still think it will eventually come down to that 4% target or something changed there?Robert J. ThomsonWell, Kane, we're certainly aiming high when it comes to Foxtel. And you can see from the success that we've had in streaming. Our total streaming subs rose 14% to $3.1 million, and our streaming revenues rose 26%. So that's also a healthy growth in ARPU. At the same time, our broadcast churn fell sharply and was 11.1% in the quarter compared to 13.8% in the prior year, while broadcast ARPU rose 2%. So, where else in the world are you actually witnessing a decline in the broadcast churn rate while experiencing a continuing surge in streaming? That really is the Foxtel success story.Susan Lee PanuccioAnd Kane, just in relation to the CapEx. Yes, we still think that's a relevant target over time. As I've mentioned in my comments, we expect CapEx to be relatively stable in the coming year because we've got the reinvestment in relation to the aggregation service that we're about to launch.OperatorOur next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evanson Partners.Entcho RaykovskiRobert. Susan. My question is around the Foxtel shareholder loan. Obviously, you flagged the intention for it to be repaid. Just interested, once that's repaid, do you expect any recourse to News Corp from lenders? In other words, will you have to guarantee any of the Foxtel refi? And I guess as part of answering that question, is there anything in particular which has driven the ability of Foxtel to refinance, particularly if you're not guaranteeing the loan. And sorry, I will just extend it a little bit further. Should we read this into a preparation for a potential spin out of Foxtel down the track? Obviously, that's been speculated for a little while.Susan Lee PanuccioEntcho , maybe I'll take the first couple. So no, we don't have a guarantee on there. And no, we don't that there will be anything to do with the guarantee going forward in relation to the refi. Actually, the reason that we could refi it so successfully is really because of the underlying business performance of Foxtel. They've had a great couple of years and really reinvented themselves. And it's a real credit to the team down there that they've got themselves into this position. So that's really what's driving the strong refi outcome. And maybe I'll hand over to Robert to comment on the IPO.Robert J. ThomsonYes. Entcho, obviously we can't comment specifically about an IPO. But what I can say with absolute certainty is that the success we've had with Foxtel has given us absolutely the option of optionality.OperatorOur next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.Craig Anthony HuberBook Publishing, obviously, the margins and the profit dollars there were much lower than I think most people expect it, certainly me, but also they are much lower than pre-COVID and stuff. Is there any reason to think this environment that this revenue performance and the margins won't continue for at least a few more quarters?Robert J. ThomsonCraig, look, obviously, the 53rd week comparison exaggerates the decline, but the inflationary pressures are beginning to abate and some of the costs around royalty write-offs were relatively unique. So the team at HarperCollins have obviously been taking a remedial action to improve our fortunes for this fiscal. We've implemented a price rise across various categories. And actually, the team is particularly confident about the impact of our current releases.And it's safe to say that our expectation, our firm expectation is that there will be significant margin improvement this year. This very week. We have Three of the top 10 fiction bestsellers in the U.S. with the #1 seller Ann Patchett's Tom Lake, which has already sold more than 100,000 copies across print and digital in the first week on sale. As well in that top 10, we have Demon Copperhead from Barbara Kingsolver and The Collector by Daniel Silva. Now that success in the top 10 will be reflected in the bottom line.OperatorOur next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.Lucy HuangI just have one question on Professional Information Services. Are you able to talk through kind of what drove the growth over the fourth quarter. What's the contribution from subscriber growth versus price growth in that business? And I guess maybe if you can talk through some of your margin expectations coming into the fourth quarter. Is there expected to be more incremental investment in this space? Or could we see margins continue to expand into next year?Robert J. ThomsonWell, Lucy, safe to say we're delighted with the progress in the Dow Jones B2B business. You can see the impact on our margin more broadly at Dow Jones and longer term, you'll see it at News Corporation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the EBITDA margin at Dow Jones was adding 0.8% in the last quarter, it was 24.4%, and the overall margin at News Corp rose from 11.8% to 14%, and in a year where we were presented with real macro challenges. Net margin increase is, of course, a measure of growing profitability, but it's also a measure of our robustness. So quarter after quarter, year after year, we've seen double-digit growth increases at Risk &amp; Compliance. We now expect the same for Opus and CMA and we're frankly, delighted with the speed of integration of both Opus and CMA and ensuing quarters, will see the benefits of that.OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.Brian HanOn the Wall Street Journal, can you please provide some color on digital subscription pricing in terms of how much it rose in the June quarter and what the outlook may be for '24?Robert J. ThomsonBrian, difficult to be too specific. What you're seeing in the circulation patterns at Dow Jones is partly a matter of phasing and a modest decline in print subscriptions. The emphasis is on the digital bundle with the combination of Mark Wash Barns and The Wall Street Journal. And sometimes in the shorter term, that means the average price of age is a little lower, but we are building loyalty and reducing churn in each of the products and in the long term, increasing the price elasticity. I mean, the biggest problem for any Richemont business, apart from acquisition itself is churn.OperatorOur next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.Darren LeungJust a quick one on Move, please. It looks like the revenues declined 24 -- odd % but listing is obviously only down 20%. So I just wanted a bit of clarity in terms of this seems to be the first period where we've actually seen revenue growth declined more than volume growth. So I just wanted a bit of clarity at what's happening to the yield and other products base, that's usually been a bit of an offset for the business, please?Robert J. ThomsonObviously, the housing market slowdown in the U.S. is having a profound impact on all digital property companies. And that is being reflected to a certain extent at REALTOR but I have to say the company is core to News corporation, it's complementary to other assets. And you're going to see that irrefutable fact in coming months with the impact of Damian Eales, who knows our company intimately. And what you will see with a lot of digital property companies is the cost of marketing. And we're remaking our marketing and have strong plans for leveraging our platforms. And look, we're talking about enormously influential digital platforms. It helps the Wall Street Journal, by the way, to have exposure in Florida via Realtor. And it helps Realtor to have the Florida audience in the New York Post, which is in the many, many millions. As I mentioned, the post has about 145 million monthly uniques. We have about 80 million at Dow Jones. And in the U.S. alone, about $110 million at the Sun depending on the month. And so in building both listings and yield, we're going to be obsessively focused on leveraging that comparative advantage.Susan Lee PanuccioAnd Darren, there's a little bit of noise in the numbers because of week 53. If you exclude the week 53 impact, it was actually down 17%, which was consistent with what it was down last quarter.Robert J. ThomsonAnd I would just make one further observation about the Australian property market, as Susan alluded to earlier. I would say that we are seeing some particularly positive signs in Australian housing market, which will surely benefit REA and us. There's no doubt that activity has already picked up this quarter, and that should be reflected in our results. It's a very transparent market. Anyone can track listings and the auction completion rate. So I would encourage investors to do the math in coming weeks. Sometimes we've forgotten that thanks to Lachlan Murdoch, REA is an integral part of News Corporation, and it has a market cap today of around AUD 21 billion.OperatorNext question will be a follow-up from Craig Huber from Huber Research .Craig Anthony HuberI appreciate the much better results in this quarter and you guys have had some really good results you know ever since COVID happened in particular. But it comes up all the time with investors, why is this company News Corp so complicated? And is there any potential movement here to to simplify the company going forward? I guess, I'd love to have updated thoughts on that with what you can tell us.Robert J. ThomsonLook, we are constantly reviewing our structure to ensure the optimal use of resources and the best outcomes for investors. That's why we were prepared to contemplate a sale of REALTOR for rather generous price. And why we've done much underlying structural and regulatory work that gives us more flexibility in our collective decision-making. So we're conscious, acutely conscious of our responsibilities to investors, but also acutely aware of the value of our assets. And we've been building a portfolio for a reason. You can see, since our split, annual print-related revenues have decreased almost $3.2 billion. That is correct, $3.2 billion. And we've more than replaced that number with digital growth and made the company far more profitable with far greater free cashflow. So we know that we do need to provide more transparency so that the value and the potential of our assets are better understood as you made clear. That's why we broke out Dow Jones. And you can see the rapidly increasing revenues, particularly in the professional information business, which was the largest contributor to profitability this year. And that has already been noticed by investors.OperatorAt this time, we have no further questions. So I'll hand over to Michael Florin for closing remarks.Michael FlorinGreat. Well, thank you, Leila, and thank you all very much for participating. Have a wonderful day, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care.]"

211,21e772ec-ddb2-3cc2-b725-4f27c4c607ca,VZ,2023-08-12,12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-undervalued-blue-chip-stocks-215945675.html,1691791185,STORY,"['KO', 'MCD', 'DIS', 'TRV', 'VZ', 'CVX', 'WBA', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'WMT', 'NKE', 'CRM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at 12 undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to Wall Street analysts. If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip stocks, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Out of these, a mere handful manages to catch public attention due to a variety of factors. These firms can either be popular household names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), firms that have created new industries like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or companies that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and are known for their financial stability and strength.Firms at the top of the stock market food chain are often referred to as Blue Chip stocks. The term 'Blue Chip' is more than a century old, and as you might have guessed, it comes from poker where players assign a monetary value to chips and then gamble on them with cards. A blue chip stock in the 1920s would typically have a share price greater than $200 and the term was coined by a reporter for Dow Jones. These days, there are no fixed criteria to define a firm as a blue chip, however, the typical classification normally includes the 30 stocks included in the Dow 30 index.Investing in blue chip stocks typically offers a variety of benefits that one might be unable to accrue when investing in other stocks such as penny stocks or small cap stocks. These firms are typically quite resilient to significant share price drops due to their size and stability, and their popularity also provides the market with plenty of liquidity. Not to mention, several blue chip stocks also pay dividends. We took a closer look at blue chip firms with large market capitalization and stable dividend growth as part of our 12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy coverage and determined that the top dividend paying stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesAugust is an important month for the stock market as it will see several large firms report their earnings for the second quarter of 2023. These earnings come at a time when high interest rates take their toll on corporate spending, but lowering inflation provides consumers with more leeway to make expensive purchases. To add to this, the earnings also provide important hints about the current state of the U.S. economy, to enable analysts and economists to determine whether a recession might materialize just when everybody starts looking the other way.One blue chip stock that reported its earnings in August is Apple. The largest technology company in the world saw its quarterly revenue drop for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the revenue for the first three quarters also fell. However, Apple still beat analyst EPS estimates due to lower costs in administrative and other expenses. Another blue chip firm and one whose sales are closely watched to measure consumer spending power is Coca-Cola. It is the largest beverage company in the world and one that had a strong second quarter as it managed to beat analyst EPS estimates by a wide margin. Coca-Cola reported $12 billion in net revenues for the quarter, which marked a 6% annual growth. The results indicated that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation, and the revenue growth also enabled Coca-Cola to report a 34% GAAP EPS growth.However, for the beverages company, the biggest takeaway from its second quarter of 2023 earnings was not the revenue or the EPS figures. Instead, it was Coca-Cola's guidance, as the company upgraded its non-GAAP revenue guidance to predict an 8% to 9% organic growth for the full year 2023. Corporate guidance is a crucial factor in an earnings season like the one we're currently in the middle of. This is because firms have a real time view of their operations which leaves them in a better position to predict future outcomes. These outcomes, when put together, can also provide the tea leaves to make a prediction of the broader economic performance.Joining Coca-Cola as an important company whose earnings guidance and financial performance are also an economic barometer is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The retailer has direct contact with consumers due to its business model, and while it has not reported its latest earnings, investment bank Credit Suisse has some good news for the stock as it has increased Walmart's share price target to $180 from $170. Credit Suisse believes that Walmart is positioned well to handle any volatility in consumer spending as its entire approach is based on providing customers with value.With this context, let's take a look at the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to Wall Street. The stocks leading the pack are The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street AnalystsNorthfoto / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to analysts, we calculated the share price upside for blue chip companies based on their average share price target data from Yahoo Finance.

FALLON/AFP via Getty ImagesTwo ageing French billionaires sit atop the global luxury market: Bernard Arnault and François Pinault.Arnault, 74, is the world’s second richest man with a personal fortune of around $218bn (£170.5bn) and presides over an empire that spans Louis Vuitton luggage, Tiffany diamonds and Moët champagne at LVMH.Pinault, 86, controls Gucci, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and through his own conglomerate, Kering.The pair have spent a lifetime building kingdoms that have helped to cement Paris as the capital of the world of luxury. Both men are preparing to hand their legacy onto the next generation, with both LVMH and Kering likely to remain within family control.Yet the pair suddenly face a surprise challenge: the first truly American luxury group.On Thursday, New York-based Tapestry – the owner of Coach handbags and Kate Spade – announced an $8.5bn (£6.7bn) deal to buy Capri Holdings, the parent company of Jimmy Choo, Michael Kors, and Versace.The deal, spearheaded by Tapestry’s chief executive officer Joanne Crevoiserat, turns the company into a major force in the industry with the heft to compete with Europe.Crevoiserat, a former Abercrombie &amp; Fitch chief operating officer, joined Tapestry in 2019, shortly after its share price was hammered amid disappointing sales.She has helped to steady the ship but is now taking a significant gamble with the Capri deal.Luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault is the world's second richest man - Heathcliff O'MalleyCrevoiserat, who also sits on the board of General Motors and has worked at WalMart, said the takeover will create “a new powerful global luxury house”, suggesting ambitions to rival Europe’s biggest names.Yet shares in Tapestry fell nearly 16pc after the debt-funded deal was announced, amid concerns about slowing sales at home.“Given a slowdown in luxury spend in their core US market, the combined Tapestry/Capri entity will need to focus on international expansion to achieve material revenue growth in the near term,” says Jonathan De Mello, founder and chief executive of retail consultancy JDM Retail.Story continues“This could indeed well mean taking on LVMH and Kering in their own backyards.”Capri’s sales fell 9.6pc over the quarter to July 1, it said this week. Rival Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, said North American revenues had fallen 10pc, pointing to an industry-wide downturn.The slowdown comes after years of booming sales. Sales of luxury goods hit €345 billion (£298bn) in 2022, according to Bain &amp; Company. The market is predicted to be worth as much as €570bn (£491bn) by 2030. The fact Bain gives its estimates in euros is telling.Tapestry and Capri Holdings raked in a combined $12bn in sales last year.However, the sum is dwarfed by its European rivals. LVMH turned over €79.2 billion (£68.5bn) in 2022.Kering, meanwhile, which also owns Yves Saint Laurent, reported sales of €20.3bn (£18bn) in 2022. The company recently signed a record-breaking deal to open a new Yves Saint Lauren store on London’s Bond Street, agreeing to pay £13m for a six-storey property. Last month it snapped up a 30pc stake in Italian fashion house Valentino for €1.7bn (£1.47bn).As well as sheer size, LVMH and Kering have prestige and reputation on their side.“The Arnault family is enmeshed in luxury,” says Neil Saunders, managing director at Globaldata Retail. “They really understand the business in a very deep way. If you look at them and didn’t realise they were family, looked at as a management suite, you would say that’s a really good board you’ve got there.”Saunders argues that many of Tapestry’s brands are simply not high-end enough to rival those owned by LVMH and Kering. A Coach handbag costs around £450, compared to more than £1,400 for a Louis Vuitton tote.“[Tapestry and Capri’s brands] are almost like the very high end of the mass market,” Saunders says, “whereas with a lot of the European houses, while they do have some brands that play in the mass market, they are much more sort of rarefied luxury, true luxury brands that operate at the very high end.”Retail consultant Andrew Busby said: “It’s a bit like a Corvette trying to compete with a Ferrari.”“Even though Capri has great brands in terms of Jimmy Choo, and Versace, and so forth, they’re quite niche.“You look at some of the LVMH brands, and they’ve been around for so long, and they just hold a different sort of appeal to people.“In my view, an American-owned [company] will never be able to compete.”Rather than fearing the competition, Paris may view the Tapestry deal as simply recognition of their huge success.High-end Louis Vuitton bags regularly retail for thousands of pounds more than their Tapestry rivals - John Nguyen/JNVisualsSaunders says: “I think this is more about Tapestry wanting to emulate what [LVMH and Kering] do in terms of their business model, which is to have a house of brands that appeal to different segments in slightly different ways and manage them centrally, so that you reduce costs and expand.“It’s almost like a form of flattery.”He believes it is the more accessible brands back in the US such as Ralph Lauren and Tory Burch should be most worried about increased competition from Tapestry thanks to its new scale.“Looking more specifically at the accessible luxury market, Tapestry and Capri creates a player that dwarfs largely independent and mostly private European peers,” adds Luca Solca, senior research analyst on global luxury goods at Bernstein. “I don’t expect any material implications for the global high-end luxury goods industry.”In any case, Crevoiserat will be hoping that bringing Tapestry and Capri’s brands under one roof will help grow sales even as the US market loses momentum.“Asia is probably the standout area for growth,” says Saunders. “Travel is resuming, people are going back to offices. So they’re buying more apparel and more goods for those purposes.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

""We are establishing a powerful global house of iconic fashion brands.""Tapestry shocked Wall Street on Thursday by announcing it will spend $57 a share to buy rival Capri Holdings (CPRI) for a total enterprise value of $8.5 billion. The transaction will see Tapestry — the steward of Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman — gain control of Versace, Michael Kors, and Jimmy Choo by sometime in 2024.Capri's stock surged 55% to $53.90 on Thursday. But Tapestry stock fell 15.93% to $34.67 as some experts began to question whether the company needed to pull the trigger and if it overpaid for Capri.Tapestry paid ""a healthy multiple on a company that I just don't think was that healthy,"" Pauline Brown, former LVMH Chairman of North America, told Yahoo Finance.Crevoiserat thinks the deal will be proven right over time as her C-suite extracts cost efficiencies from the combined company and expands it in the fast-growing Asia luxury market.Here are several high-level points from the term sheet:The purchase price for Capri marked a 39% premium to its closing price on Wednesday.$200 million in cost synergies are expected by three years after deal closes.A 17% quarterly dividend was approved despite the transaction.The deal will be funded through a mix of new debt and cash on the balance sheet.The transaction marks the next chapter for Crevoiserat at Tapestry.Crevoiserat joined Tapestry in 2019 as CFO after a successful stint at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch as CFO and COO. In October 2020, Crevoiserat was named CEO amid deep struggles for the owner of Coach and the newly acquired Kate Spade brand.A person carries a bag from the Michael Kors store on Aug. 26, 2018, in Central Valley, New York.

This company, which is in the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This maker of high-end shoes and handbags has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 20.07%.For the last reported quarter, Tapestry came out with earnings of $0.78 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.59 per share, representing a surprise of 32.20%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.26 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.36 per share, delivering a surprise of 7.94%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Tapestry lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Tapestry currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.71%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 17, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

There's excellent strategic fit.Crevoiserat added, ""We're confident that investors will see this compelling opportunity.

Tapestry announced it will spend $8.5 billion to buy its long-time rival. Transaction will add new brands to its portfolio like Versace, Michael Kors, and Jimmy Choo. So what does this all mean for Tapestry? And how does it fit into the larger M&amp;A action we've been seeing this year, of course, in retail.Joanne Crevoiserat joins us now, Tapestry CEO. Joanne, great to see you here. Congrats on this deal. I know things like this do not happen overnight. Now, the market reaction was tough. I mean, shares of Tapestry went down 16% on the deal. What did the market not get, Joanne? What did they miss?JOANNE CREVOISERAT: Well, I'll start by saying first, it's great to see you, Brian. And I know you love brands, so this is a very attractive combination. We're establishing a powerful global house of iconic fashion brands, uniting, as you said, Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman with Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors.And we're excited about bringing these brands together because of the compelling financial opportunity. There's excellent strategic fit. It's immediately accretive, and we see significant runway beyond just the initial combination. And I think we're confident that investors will see this compelling opportunity. This is a story to watch, Brian.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: What makes the transaction so compelling?JOANNE CREVOISERAT: Well, again, you know, it is about the strategic fit. We're thinking long term about our business. And the strategic fit of this transaction, it builds our portfolio in a great category. We play in a resilient $200 billion luxury market that includes handbags, footwear, and apparel. And these brands are incredibly-- they're distinctive in that market, but they're also complementary.If you think about our two businesses, this deepens our access to a higher-end luxury consumer that is quite resilient. There's geographic diversification here where the Capri business has a relatively higher penetration in Europe. Our business has relatively higher penetration in Asia, and it broadens our product offering because the product categories are also complementary, where the Capri business has a higher penetration in lifestyle categories like footwear and apparel. And we see opportunity to grow those categories across our portfolio.So on a number of different levels these businesses are complementary. And then we believe that we have an opportunity to leverage the Tapestry platform to drive a direct to consumer opportunity. We've built this strong consumer engagement platform and elevated our direct business. And we think that applies as well to the Capri businesses.BRIAN SOZZI: I've been covering your company for a while, Joanne, going back to when it was just called Coach. And I remember that 2017 acquisition of Kate Spade. This was before you. There were challenges integrating that business, again, before you. What is the institutional knowledge inside of Tapestry to better integrate a company like a Capri which is a lot bigger than Capri-- I mean, Capri, which is a lot bigger than what you bought a couple of years ago in Kate Spade.JOANNE CREVOISERAT: Exactly. Well, we have experience in integrating. And I would say that we've learned a lot over those years, right? And the importance-- and the things that are important that we've learned, the importance of clarifying the brand positioning, not walking away from the unique and distinctive aspects of each of these brands.These brands are iconic, and they have-- we fielded a lot of research in the process. They are strong brands. They're well positioned in attractive markets and market segments. So our first learning has been clarifying the brand positioning. And in our transformation over the last three years, we've done exactly that across our brands, clarifying that brand positioning and crystallizing the target consumer to make sure that we're strengthening our execution behind the product offering and the experiences for that target consumer.We've also strengthened our teams in ways of working, embedding data and analytics. We've spent a lot of time, I know, over the years talking about that, Brian, embedding those analytics in the hands of decision makers to make our business better, move faster, and more responsive to consumer data that we have.And we've invested in brand building activities over the past few years. We've more than doubled our marketing spend. So as we work to engage consumers and integrate these brands, it will be with that focus on continuing to build the brands.We're also going to be quite choiceful about where we decide to integrate and where we don't, knowing that there are some places that it makes sense to have a lighter touch. And businesses like Versace that's playing in a different space with a higher-end consumer where we don't have the experience or scale, the integration will be a lighter touch. And the places where we have experience in scale, we'll bring that scale to benefit the acquired brands.BRIAN SOZZI: One thing that I think the street is realizing today, and I don't think they realized it yesterday, Joanne, is the international play here. It seems like there's going to be a new unlock or new areas of growth, notably in Asia where Tapestry and Coach have really had a strong position. Does this better allow you to compete with the Louis Vuitton in those high growth emerging markets?JOANNE CREVOISERAT: We think there are opportunities around the world with this combination. They have a relatively stronger business in Europe, where we are also relatively under-penetrated. So we think there are opportunities on both sides. We can learn from the Capri brands, and they can learn from us in Asia, to your point, where we've had more success and we have higher penetration.Overall, this combination provides more balance and diversification around the world, which is great for our business. We have seen the importance of global diversification over the last three years. We've seen different parts and regions of the company accelerate at different rates and face challenges at different rates. And that's been really the underpinning of our ability to deliver consistent, strong results quarter after quarter through a very tumultuous time because we have this global footprint and diversification. And this combination only adds to that.BRIAN SOZZI: I think one of the other reactions here, Joanne is that Capri was struggling. Its shares were underperforming yours the past year ahead of this deal. What do you have to fix there?JOANNE CREVOISERAT: If I take a step back and talk about our overall vision, it's taking iconic brands, brands with true heritage, and design, and craftsmanship. And there aren't a lot of those kinds of brands in the market. So I do think it's important to take a minute and just appreciate the quality of the brands that we're bringing on.But when you combine those high quality iconic brands and put them on this modern consumer engagement platform, that's where we can deliver more innovation, more connectivity with consumers, and more relevance, which we see that as luxury at its best. And that is really the power of this combination and I think why we're so excited about the acquisition.BRIAN SOZZI: Before I let you go, Joanne, on a personal note, what does doing a deal like this mean to you? I go back, I originally met you when you were at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. You helped turn the finances around there. You came here really under a tough situation initially as the CFO, quickly rose the ranks to CEO. You've turned around this company. What is it like to pull a trigger on probably one of the biggest transformational deals in retail in the past five years?JOANNE CREVOISERAT: I see incredible potential. And the thing that gives me most energy and most gratification is seeing our teams win. We have such quality teams around the world that have-- it's harnessing the power of our teams that has really been the underpinning of our success.It's very clear in the market. I've been in this business, Brian, even before those experiences since I graduated from college, 35 years. It's moved and changed a lot. The focus on the consumer and the agility that is needed to really engage consumers today, those are the capabilities that we're building.And I get a lot of gratification from harnessing the energy and the passion of now we'll have 33,000 team members across the globe. And I think that's a powerful. It's a powerful opportunity, one that we don't take lightly. But I think it will solidify our growth going forward.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, good luck on this integration. Thanks for giving Yahoo Finance some time. We look forward to following this journey. Joanne Crevoiserat, good to see you. Have a good weekend. We'll talk to you soon.JOANNE CREVOISERAT: Thanks, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: Appreciate it.]"
222,7e41cedd-00bd-3e12-ac64-b192464d7bb5,TPR,2023-08-12,Retail earnings: What to watch next week,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/retail-earnings-watch-next-week-142159367.html,1691763719,VIDEO,"['WMT', 'CPRI', 'HD', 'TPR', 'TGT', 'TJX']","[Big box retailers such as Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT), TJX Companies (TJX), and Walmart (WMT) are set to report earnings next week. Yahoo Finance Live takes a look at the state of retail, looking back on analyst comments on retail demand heading into the latter half of 2023 and 2024, the Tapestry (TPR) and Capri (CPRI) acquisition deal, and average credit card spending by consumers and households.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: The spotlight shifts to retail next week with several earnings on tap along with retail sales. We've got big box retailers like Home Depot, Target, and Walmart first up to the plate. And so we wanted to look back at some of the tea leaves that we've gotten thus far and then look ahead to what we could hear next week.Among the various tea leaves that we got in the past week was a big deal within the retail industry--BRAD SMITH: HugeJULIE HYMAN: --in the form of Tapestry buying Capri for $8 and 1/2 billion. We talked to some folks about that. We've been sort of looking at what's been going on in specialty retail. And one of the things, one of our sort of takeaways or themes that we've been seeing here is-- and this has been a longer term thing, sluggish retail sales in the face of some of that spending going to services.And that seems to be continuing to some extent, although we've seen little glimmers of spending certainly on stuff.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And it was exciting putting together our what to watch for this earnings season for retail, specifically here because one of the other areas too that has continued to be brought up-- and, hey, there you see our little cartoon faces is the inventory. And we discussed this with Adrienne Yih. She brought this up in our conversation earlier this week, talking about how companies are needing to clean through that inventory.I believe we have a short clip of some of her commentary and what she's expecting this retail earnings season as well.ADRIENNE YIH: We're in the early, early phase of our wholesalers will go into retailers. If they can hold on to the guy and basically do the back half and get to those earnings and off margins with freight and promo recovery and below the top line, and then have top line on tight inventory, that's what you call the bout for 2024.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: And so the reason why inventory is so important is because of the promotional cycle we've seen companies have to deploy by not having that inventory marker correct. And so many of them right-sizing that kind of demand projection for what their inventory would look like. That's been key to making sure that they're more-- there are more full price sales.Think about what you hear from companies like Under Armor, which already reported and companies like Nike and many of the direct to consumer companies. The amount of the inventory that they're able to sell at full price, they're communicating that to investors, Adrienne Yih pointing out that earlier this week. And that tight inventory scenario that helps them out even further to ensure that they can hit some of those full price markers that they're looking for.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Inventory is also something that Simeon Siegel spoke about, one of BMO when we talked to him about the Tapestry Capri deal. And he also talked about where we are after a couple of roller coaster years for the retailers. He said in this moment, it's all about execution on the part of the individual retailers.SIMEON SIEGEL: We're actually back to an environment where retailers can run their businesses. Beginning of COVID, there was no supply chain, therefore there was no availability. So it didn't matter how good you were at predicting demand, you were at the whim of whatever product made it through the containers. That's no way to run a business. There's no winners and losers there.And then in the last year, it was the opposite, where everyone had so much success inventory, that it also didn't matter how good you were at predicting demand. You were just overflowed with this product that you had to move. We're back to normal, and again, that's a hard thing to say because what is normal, but we're back to an environment where I think the companies that are really good at understanding their consumer and predicting inventory accordingly will win.JULIE HYMAN: So that's kind of interesting, right, is that these retailers are no longer going to be subject to the winds of supply chain dynamics and consumer dynamics as to the same degree that they were over the past couple of years. It's going to matter more about how the management teams are doing when it comes to these companies.Now that said, the first thing that we talked about, sluggish retail sales perhaps in the face of services spending was highlighted by a couple of charts that we got from the Bank of America Institute in their monthly look at consumer spending when it comes to retail.And one of the things they looked at was the boost that we saw around the July 4th holiday here. But they compared 2022 to 2023. And we are seeing 2023 run at a little bit of a higher rate here. So that's something that should be encouraging perhaps when we await those overall July retail numbers.And they also have been tracking retail excluding restaurants and services-- including restaurants, excuse me. And basically, we are seeing those two sort of come back into line which suggests perhaps a little bit of a resurgence in good spending in line with services spending, which is intriguing. You know, who knows if that's what we're going to see writ large coming from these retailers and coming from the retail sales numbers.BRAD SMITH: It's particularly interesting on the credit side of the spending equation too because if there's one thing that we've talked about time and time again, consumers may not be breaking right now, but they certainly are pivoting how they are spending and where they're deploying cash that might be on the household balance sheet, or perhaps tapping to pay or swiping to pay that much more quickly because they know it's something that maybe they can pay off just later on down the line for a purchase that they want or maybe need right now.And that kind of contributes back into the data that came out of the New York Fed and how some of the household debt and credit report that they put forward.Right now, we're seeing credit card balances saw growth rising by $45 billion to a series high of over trillion dollars right now. And so that coming out from the New York Fed, you pair that with what some of the larger companies that are going to be reporting are already saying about how they're engaging with consumers. It's how the consumer is spending, but also where that spending and the guidance might dampen further.And so I'll just wrap on this, the impact of student loan payments resumption, that continues to come up in analyst conversation right now, could be something that impacts the guidance going forward.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, the student loan repayment buzzword and the excess savings buzzword are really going to be important for the outlooks for retail and services spending for that matter, just how are people spending money as they maybe have less of it. We'll see.]"

These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter, thus offering a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesMolina Healthcare, Inc. MOH, Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO and McKesson Corporation MCK boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years.

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip stocks, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Out of these, a mere handful manages to catch public attention due to a variety of factors. These firms can either be popular household names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), firms that have created new industries like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or companies that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and are known for their financial stability and strength.Firms at the top of the stock market food chain are often referred to as Blue Chip stocks. The term 'Blue Chip' is more than a century old, and as you might have guessed, it comes from poker where players assign a monetary value to chips and then gamble on them with cards. A blue chip stock in the 1920s would typically have a share price greater than $200 and the term was coined by a reporter for Dow Jones. These days, there are no fixed criteria to define a firm as a blue chip, however, the typical classification normally includes the 30 stocks included in the Dow 30 index.Investing in blue chip stocks typically offers a variety of benefits that one might be unable to accrue when investing in other stocks such as penny stocks or small cap stocks. These firms are typically quite resilient to significant share price drops due to their size and stability, and their popularity also provides the market with plenty of liquidity. Not to mention, several blue chip stocks also pay dividends. We took a closer look at blue chip firms with large market capitalization and stable dividend growth as part of our 12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy coverage and determined that the top dividend paying stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesAugust is an important month for the stock market as it will see several large firms report their earnings for the second quarter of 2023. These earnings come at a time when high interest rates take their toll on corporate spending, but lowering inflation provides consumers with more leeway to make expensive purchases. To add to this, the earnings also provide important hints about the current state of the U.S. economy, to enable analysts and economists to determine whether a recession might materialize just when everybody starts looking the other way.One blue chip stock that reported its earnings in August is Apple. The largest technology company in the world saw its quarterly revenue drop for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the revenue for the first three quarters also fell. However, Apple still beat analyst EPS estimates due to lower costs in administrative and other expenses. Another blue chip firm and one whose sales are closely watched to measure consumer spending power is Coca-Cola. It is the largest beverage company in the world and one that had a strong second quarter as it managed to beat analyst EPS estimates by a wide margin. Coca-Cola reported $12 billion in net revenues for the quarter, which marked a 6% annual growth. The results indicated that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation, and the revenue growth also enabled Coca-Cola to report a 34% GAAP EPS growth.However, for the beverages company, the biggest takeaway from its second quarter of 2023 earnings was not the revenue or the EPS figures. Instead, it was Coca-Cola's guidance, as the company upgraded its non-GAAP revenue guidance to predict an 8% to 9% organic growth for the full year 2023. Corporate guidance is a crucial factor in an earnings season like the one we're currently in the middle of. This is because firms have a real time view of their operations which leaves them in a better position to predict future outcomes. These outcomes, when put together, can also provide the tea leaves to make a prediction of the broader economic performance.Joining Coca-Cola as an important company whose earnings guidance and financial performance are also an economic barometer is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The retailer has direct contact with consumers due to its business model, and while it has not reported its latest earnings, investment bank Credit Suisse has some good news for the stock as it has increased Walmart's share price target to $180 from $170. Credit Suisse believes that Walmart is positioned well to handle any volatility in consumer spending as its entire approach is based on providing customers with value.With this context, let's take a look at the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to Wall Street.

245,539399bd-a1a1-33ec-b637-cbccb69f8788,DIS,2023-08-12,Here's Why Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Has A Meaningful Debt Burden,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-walt-disney-nyse-110052941.html,1691838052,STORY,['DIS'],"[Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney What Is Walt Disney's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Walt Disney had US$47.2b of debt in July 2023, down from US$51.6b, one year before. On the flip side, it has US$11.5b in cash leading to net debt of about US$35.7b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Walt Disney's LiabilitiesAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Walt Disney had liabilities of US$28.2b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$64.6b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$11.5b and US$13.1b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$68.3b.This deficit isn't so bad because Walt Disney is worth a massive US$162.9b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Walt Disney has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.7 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 4.9 times. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. One way Walt Disney could vanquish its debt would be if it stops borrowing more but continues to grow EBIT at around 14%, as it did over the last year. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Walt Disney can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. In the last three years, Walt Disney's free cash flow amounted to 32% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt.Our ViewNeither Walt Disney's ability to convert EBIT to free cash flow nor its net debt to EBITDA gave us confidence in its ability to take on more debt. But we do take some comfort from its EBIT growth rate. We think that Walt Disney's debt does make it a bit risky, after considering the aforementioned data points together. Not all risk is bad, as it can boost share price returns if it pays off, but this debt risk is worth keeping in mind. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Walt Disney is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Still, the earnings beat was reassuring attributed to Disney’s Parks &amp; Experiences segment while the company aims to strengthen its media assets. Notably, Disney’s Parks segment revenue rose 12% to $8.32 billion with net income up 11% to $2.42 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCost Cutting: Bob Iger stated Disney’s quarterly results were reflective of the company’s unprecedented transformation to restructure, improve efficiencies, and restore creativity to the center of its business.Iger elaborated that this is creating a more cost-effective, coordinated, and streamlined approach to Disney’s operations and has put the company on track to exceed its initial goal of $5.5 billion in savings while improving direct-to-consumer operating income by roughly $1 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStreaming Wars: Regarding streaming subscribers in Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer Segment, Disney+ had 146 million users during Q3 which was down -7% from a year ago and missed estimates by -5%.However, Disney stated it would raise prices on ad-free streaming plans and crack down on password sharing similar to Netflix NFLX. This seemed to appease investors and Disney is still ahead of other rivals such as Paramount PARA and Warner Bros. Discovery WBD in regards to subscribers.Paramount+ had 61 million subscribers following its most recent quarter with Warner’s Max subscribers at 95.8 million (merger of Discovery+ and HBO Max). Furthermore, Disney’s total subscribers including ESPN+ and Hulu stood at roughly 219.6 million users placing the company firmly in the second position behind Netflix’s 238.4 million users.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSports Betting: Other favorable news included Disney announcing it would sell exclusive rights to its ESPN Bet trademark to Penn Entertainment PENN for $1.5 billion. Penn will pay the sum out in installments over the next 10 years.TakeawayWith Bob Iger at the helm of Disney again, the company appears to be making the right steps to get back to prominence and currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Overall the company’s Q3 report was favorable and while there may be better buying opportunities ahead holding Disney shares could still be rewarding.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AAPL), firms that have created new industries like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or companies that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and are known for their financial stability and strength.Firms at the top of the stock market food chain are often referred to as Blue Chip stocks. The term 'Blue Chip' is more than a century old, and as you might have guessed, it comes from poker where players assign a monetary value to chips and then gamble on them with cards. A blue chip stock in the 1920s would typically have a share price greater than $200 and the term was coined by a reporter for Dow Jones. These days, there are no fixed criteria to define a firm as a blue chip, however, the typical classification normally includes the 30 stocks included in the Dow 30 index.Investing in blue chip stocks typically offers a variety of benefits that one might be unable to accrue when investing in other stocks such as penny stocks or small cap stocks. These firms are typically quite resilient to significant share price drops due to their size and stability, and their popularity also provides the market with plenty of liquidity. Not to mention, several blue chip stocks also pay dividends. We took a closer look at blue chip firms with large market capitalization and stable dividend growth as part of our 12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy coverage and determined that the top dividend paying stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesAugust is an important month for the stock market as it will see several large firms report their earnings for the second quarter of 2023. These earnings come at a time when high interest rates take their toll on corporate spending, but lowering inflation provides consumers with more leeway to make expensive purchases. To add to this, the earnings also provide important hints about the current state of the U.S. economy, to enable analysts and economists to determine whether a recession might materialize just when everybody starts looking the other way.One blue chip stock that reported its earnings in August is Apple. The largest technology company in the world saw its quarterly revenue drop for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the revenue for the first three quarters also fell. However, Apple still beat analyst EPS estimates due to lower costs in administrative and other expenses. Another blue chip firm and one whose sales are closely watched to measure consumer spending power is Coca-Cola. It is the largest beverage company in the world and one that had a strong second quarter as it managed to beat analyst EPS estimates by a wide margin. Coca-Cola reported $12 billion in net revenues for the quarter, which marked a 6% annual growth. The results indicated that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation, and the revenue growth also enabled Coca-Cola to report a 34% GAAP EPS growth.However, for the beverages company, the biggest takeaway from its second quarter of 2023 earnings was not the revenue or the EPS figures. Instead, it was Coca-Cola's guidance, as the company upgraded its non-GAAP revenue guidance to predict an 8% to 9% organic growth for the full year 2023. Corporate guidance is a crucial factor in an earnings season like the one we're currently in the middle of. This is because firms have a real time view of their operations which leaves them in a better position to predict future outcomes. These outcomes, when put together, can also provide the tea leaves to make a prediction of the broader economic performance.Joining Coca-Cola as an important company whose earnings guidance and financial performance are also an economic barometer is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The retailer has direct contact with consumers due to its business model, and while it has not reported its latest earnings, investment bank Credit Suisse has some good news for the stock as it has increased Walmart's share price target to $180 from $170. Credit Suisse believes that Walmart is positioned well to handle any volatility in consumer spending as its entire approach is based on providing customers with value.With this context, let's take a look at the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to Wall Street.

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal joins the Live show to provide an update on the state of the Hollywood strikes and the effect that these strikes are having on major studios like Paramount (PARA) and Disney (DIS).Video Transcript- The Writers Union is returning to the bargaining table, agreeing to restart talks with studios. The two sides formally meeting today. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has been following the strike for us over the last several weeks. Allie, what do we know now?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, Seana, remember, this comes after talks fell apart last week. So it's certainly a positive story in what's been a very long journey so far. The writers strike surpassing that critical 100-day mark. We'll see if these talks can lead to anything substantial. Now last week, the WGA said that the studios approached them with a template of a deal that was modeled off of the agreement that they struck with the Directors Guild of America.Now the WGA was very offended by that, considering all of these guilds have pretty different wants. A large sticking point there being streaming residuals, how these writers get paid for projects that continue to boom on streaming services. Another big point is the amount of writers that are needed to staff current projects. The WGA has said that studios are trying to really squeeze as much as they can out of writers. So instead of assigning a project with five writers, they are assigning a project with two writers and making those writers work even harder. So that's a big sticking point as well.We know the WGA, they've been very brazen in their language. They have consistently said that they will not go down without a fight, and they really want a deal that is as fair and as equitable as possible. So we'll see if we make any progress as those negotiations restart. But by and large, this is a positive thing considering these two sides have really seemed to be so far apart for so long.Story continues- Allie, we know studio executives have been asked about this and the impacts of the strike in some of these earnings calls. What have we heard from them? And what are the chances you think of the studio is kind of breaking the longer this goes?ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's been a part of the discussion, especially since we have a media environment right now that's very fragmented, right? You have these legacy media companies coupled with these giant streaming platforms, and they all have really different wants and different abilities when it comes to striking some of those contracts.Now this week, we heard specifically from Paramount and Disney. I want to start by reading a quote from Paramount CEO Bob Bakish because Paramount has actually rejiggered their production schedule. He said, quote, we're saddened that as an industry, we couldn't come to an agreement that would have prevented this. We remain hopeful for a timely resolution, and we are committed to finding a path forward.At the same time, we have a responsibility to minimize disruptions to our audiences and other constituents. To that end, we've adjusted our fall slate by leaning into the full power of Paramount's content capabilities. So part of that has been re-airing old Yellowstone episodes on CBS. We also heard from Disney CEO Bob Iger who had some interesting comments a few weeks ago that angered a lot of WGA members.But on the earnings call on Wednesday night, he had a much more muted but sympathetic tone. He said, quote, nothing is more important to this company than its relationship with the creative community. And that includes actors, writers, animators, directors, and producers. I have deep respect and appreciation for all those who are vital to the extraordinary creative engine that drives this company in our industry. That is my fervent hope that we quickly find solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months. And I am personally committed to working to achieve this result.And that's really the language we've heard from all of these studio executives on these earnings calls. They want a resolution as quickly as possible. They say that is paramount to their business operations moving forward. But if they're not willing to bend on certain things that the writers and the actors want, I just find it really hard that we're going to get a resolution quickly. And right now, there seems to be a lot of division. So we'll see how the talks go this weekend and whether we make any progress on that front because the longer this goes on, the more it's going to affect all of our favorite shows, movies, and therefore, are these companies.- And of course, the LA economy as well. Allie Canal, thanks.]"

In the latest week, U.S. crude prices rose by 0.3%, compared with the near 5% rise seen two weeks ago and during the second week of the rally.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled up 37 cents, or 0.5%, both for the day and week. It was the smallest weekly advance for WTI since the rally that began in the week to June 16. Notwithstanding the slowing pace of the rally, the U.S. crude benchmark still hit a 9-month high of $84.89 on Thursday and is up about 20% in all in under two months.London-based Brent crude also rose meagerly for the week. It settled at $86.81 per barrel, up 41 cents, or 0.5%, on the day, and 0.7% higher on the week. Like WTI, the weekly gain for Brent was the smallest since the oil rally which began seven weeks ago. But in a similar trend to its U.S. counterpart, the global crude benchmark touched a new milestone on Thursday, reaching a seven-month high of $88.10. In under two months, Brent is up 18%.Oil managed to end the day and week higher after early weakness in Friday’s trade that followed through with Thursday’s lower close.After a seven-week run-up, complacency was setting into the market, enough “sometimes that…you get a decent pullback”, Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said. He, however, conceded that momentum was still adequate to deliver another week of gains, adding that “energy traders remain overly confident the oil market will remain tight” and that “it doesn’t seem like exhaustion is settling in yet”.Friday’s higher close came after the Paris-based International Energy Agency estimated that global oil demand hit a record 103 million barrels per day in June and could scale another peak in August.Story continuesEven so, the so-called IEA, revised down its forecast for August demand by 150,000 barrels per day from July.""The global economic outlook remains challenging in the face of soaring interest rates and tighter bank credit, squeezing businesses that are already having to cope with sluggish manufacturing and trade,"" said the agency, which looks out for the welfare of global oil consumers.For 2023, the IEA sees a 2.2M-barrel-per-day growth. That is less than the 2.44M-barrels daily growth forecast by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.On a daily basis, demand for this year is forecast to average 102.2M barrels, the IEA said, with China accounting for more than 70% of growth, despite concerns about the economic health of the world's top oil importer.For 2024, the IEA forecast world demand growth for oil to slow sharply to 1.0M barrels per day, citing lackluster macroeconomic conditions, a post-pandemic recovery running out of steam and the burgeoning use of electric vehicles.""With the post-pandemic rebound largely completed and as multiple headwinds challenge the OECD's outlook, oil consumption gains slow markedly,"" the agency added.Related ArticlesOil: Into its 7th-week, the rally is slowing Texas power use hits 3rd record this week in heat waveCrude oil edges higher on bullish IEA report; U.S. PPI weighs]"

Overall consumption also expanded once again in the April to June period after two straight quarters of contraction.The IEA estimated that global demand for crude would expand by 2.2M barrels per day (bpd) to 102.2M bpd this year, with China accounting for more than 70% of that growth despite continued concerns over a sputtering post-COVID recovery in the world's top crude importer.Meanwhile, OPEC+ production cuts may further eat away at inventories later this year, the IEA noted, giving an extra boost to prices. The Paris-based watchdog predicted that inventories could draw by 2.2M bpd in the third quarter and 1.2M bpd in the final three months of 2023 should the output reductions remain in place.""Market balances are set to tighten further into the autumn as Saudi Arabia and Russia extend supply cuts at least through September,"" the IEA said.But the agency flagged that demand growth is expected to slow to 1M barrels per day next year, citing lackluster economic conditions as a wave of activity following the pandemic subsides.

While the energy sector faces challenges, Devon Energy remains a strong long-term investment. Despite recent share declines, the shift towards social normalization, such as the return to offices, could positively impact traffic volumes. This could benefit DVN and other hydrocarbon companies.Devon Energy achieved record Q2 oil production at 323,000 barrels per day, with projections for Q3 reaching up to 330,000 barrels per day. The company’s stock buybacks, totaling 3.8 million shares in Q2 and 39.6 million shares since late 2021, also contributed to increased shareholder value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDevon retired $242 million in debt after Q2, leading to a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.7-times. With a stronger balance sheet, Devon’s dividend yield is approximately 4.6%. The absence of a predicted U.S. recession by the Federal Reserve is expected to support oil and gas demand.

Additionally, its adjusted EBITDA rose by 15.6% to $588 million.Restaurant Brands offers the opportunity to enhance a growth investment approach, providing not only share price appreciation but also increasing dividends while demonstrating dedication to communities and environmental responsibility. Those seeking exposure to global markets and the fast-food sector can find significant potential in this company, particularly in the long run as expansion efforts and operational improvements yield results.

We believe that we have a desirable product mix that clients value and possess a core competency at allocating capital in a way to optimize the shareholder returns.P10 revenue is based on a long-term contractually locked up capital that generates robust margins and predictable earnings. We have unrivaled alignment with over 50% of our shares owned by insiders. Being added to the Russell indexes recently should promote a wider shareholder base. And as investors evaluate new index insurance, we think we screen well.With that, I will hand it off to Fritz.William Fritz SouderThank you, Robert. Fundraising and investment teams delivered a terrific quarter across all of our strategies with almost a dozen funds in the market. Our private equity strategies continued their strong 2023 performances with over $863 million added to fee-paying AUM during the quarter. After raising the hard cap to accept additional limited partners, RCP held a final close on Secondary Opportunities Fund IV at $797 million.RCP's secondary fund strategy was recently recognized by Pittsburg in a top 10 fund family in the secondary strategies. Congratulations to the RCP team for the hard work. Under standout contributors for the quarter were Bonaccord Fund II, RCP multi-strat Fund II and 2 large SMAs from RCP. Also notable in the quarter was the Bonaccord announcement that it entered into a strategic agreement with Asia heritage, a Singapore-based asset manager and in conjunction with the agreement, appointed [Chris Lerner] as operating partner to lead Bonaccord's activities in Asia.The Bonaccord-Asia heritage partnership will provide support to Bonaccord and its portfolio companies in crafting and executing capital formation initiatives in Asia, a critical growth market for private market allocations and P10. On the venture front, TrueBridge continue to demonstrate market leadership by raising $288 million across several funds. TrueBridge added over $100 million to their flagship Fund VIII and closed on 2 large SMAs that total about $160 million. We continue to see a flight of quality from institutional investors, and this plays to our strength as we provide access to elite access-constrained funds.In the same pitch book report I mentioned a moment ago, TrueBridge are in the covenant spot as the #1 fund family in the fund to funds category. Well done to the TrueBridge team in the recognition and a leadership role in a highly competitive business. Our credit strategies added $71 million to fee-paying assets under management. We continue to see strong deployment demand across NAV lending in our venture debt business.As it relates to WTI, we are still on track to launch Fund XI by Q1 2024. Our impact business continues its steady growth, having raised and deployed $49 million in the quarter. As the marketplace seeks investment vehicles with a track record of measurable impact, we believe enhanced capital is well positioned for continued growth. While we are pleased to count over 3,400 LPs as clients, we also recognize the vast opportunity we have to introduce our premier strategies to a large and growing global institutional and retail investment community.Our goal is to increase awareness among the global LP community regarding the attractiveness of our platform as evidenced by our multi-decade track record in award-winning strategies. With steady secular industry growth, we believe there is an opportunity to take market share. Finally, thanks to our dedicated team for a job well done.I will now hand it over to Clark.Clayton Clark WebbThank you, Fritz. As shareholders evaluate our prospects for long-term growth, it is important to consider the structural advantages that help explain our consistent performance and uphold the confidence we have as we look to the future. Robert mentioned the first advantage, which is our business model. The stable construction of our model provides considerable visibility and predictability in our results. The second advantage is our specialized and unique knowledge of the middle and lower middle market, gained while operating in this space for over 2 decades. We've built recognizable and powerful brands with both GPs and LPs.Another output of our strategic focus on the middle and lower middle markets is a data advantage that we believe is unmatched in the market. In what many considered to be one of the least efficient parts of the private equity and debt ecosystem, we have thousands of proprietary fund portfolio company and transaction data points that guide our investment decisions, and it's the data that gives us conviction to make an investment.This very same data shows that our portfolio companies are generally better positioned than larger companies to endure interest rate increases because they carry a lot less leverage. Many of our holdings have pricing power with the ability to pass on higher input prices and they trade at reasonable multiples, making them attractive to larger sponsors looking for add-ons and tuck-ins. By staying focused on the middle and lower middle market, we can focus on the scenes of growth rather than the entire economy. We are not a levered play on the S&amp;P 500.And finally, we give LTEs an opportunity to invest in access-constrained elite investment strategies and funds. If you look at our website or earnings slides, you'll see the rendering of a bridge. The bridge is included because we consider P10 to be the bridge to our specific private market verticals. We do not compete in the large part of the market where most of our peers reside. In fact, we rarely see any publicly traded competitor in our markets nor do we have a private competitor that covers the verticals we do. In sum, we believe we are unique.Turning now to the $5 billion fundraising target we provided last year. We are thrilled to hit that milestone 6 months ahead of schedule, which we believe is all the more impressive given the macro headwinds that have persisted since we set our target. Despite a record rise in interest rates, steep falls in equity markets and global instability, we managed to far exceed targets we laid out when the skies were blue. As noted last quarter, we still expect to lay out a new multiyear target alongside our Q4 2023 earnings call.In the interim, we would note that we still have a few larger strategies in the market, namely our second flagship GP Stakes fund and 8th flagship venture equity fund. As a result, it is certainly possible we continue strong fundraising momentum this year, though perhaps not to the same degree we saw in our record second quarter. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect to deliver double-digit growth for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and ANI. Although interest rates and the resulting interest expense will make hitting the double-digit ANI growth target more of a challenge.As we look out to 2024, we continue to expect our 11th flagship venture debt fund alongside continuous fundraising from over a dozen funds across our platform. One last thing I want to touch on is an update on our M&amp;A and partnership opportunities. Our perspective is that we don't have to do a deal to grow the business. We have market-leading investment strategies in both debt and equity across middle and lower middle market private equity, venture and impact, rounded out by our leading middle-market GP stake strategy that fits perfectly alongside the other verticals. That said, we still see a lot of opportunities and are in constant dialogue. Our bar remains quite high.I will now turn the call over to Amanda.Amanda Nethery CoussensThank you, Clark. Fee-paying assets under management were $22.2 billion, a 20% increase on a year-over-year basis. In the second quarter, $1.3 billion of fundraising and capital deployment was offset by $708 billion in step-downs and expirations. For the remainder of 2023, we expect $320 million in additional step-downs in expirations. This is about $170 million more for the remainder of the year than we previously expected. The variance is primarily attributable to the timing of certain impact deals that are concluding their fee paying period.Revenue in the second quarter was $62.5 million, a 34% increase over the second quarter of 2022. Average fee rate in the quarter was 113 basis points, driven by continued expansion of our direct strategies, such as WTI, Bonaccord and Hark. In the quarter, approximately $300 million of fund raising was closed a quarter earlier than expected. Another contributor to record second quarter performance was $4.8 million as catch-up fees, most of which is attributable to RCP's final close on Secondary Opportunities Fund IV. The fee rate for the quarter, excluding catch-up fees was 104 basis points.Operating expenses in the second quarter were $52.1 million, a 68% increase over the same period a year ago. The increase is primarily attributable to additional compensation, benefits and noncash stock-based compensation expenses related to the acquisitions of WTI, Bonaccord and Hark. GAAP net income in the quarter was $2.1 million, an 81% decrease year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $34.8 million, a 35% increase over what we reported in the second quarter of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA margin was 56%, with strength attributable to catch-up fees in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect margins to be in the range of 51% to 52%. For the second quarter, adjusted net income, or ANI, was $26.7 million, a 15% increase over the $23.2 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022. As Clark noted, rising interest rates have created a headwind on ANI growth. Though at 15% year-over-year, we are still pleased with the results. The good news is what is currently a headwind should become a tailwind as we generate cash and delever.Cash taxes for the full year should be between $3 million and $4 million, and we continue to benefit from our tax assets. As a reminder, they are composed of 2 distinct assets, the $162 million net operating loss and $383 million in tax amortization. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter were $23 million. As of today, we had an outstanding debt balance of $271.2 million and $98.5 million available on the revolver. No shares were repurchased in the quarter, and we have $18.9 million available on the buyback program.We also continue to pay our quarterly dividend. We declared a dividend of (inaudible) 0:15:16 per share on August 10, 2023, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 31, 2023, and payable on September 20, 2023. Finally, at June 30, 2023, our Class A shares outstanding were 43,823,473 and Class B shares outstanding were 72,381,726 shares.Thank you. Now, let's turn it over to the operator for a few questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Ken Worthington with JPM.Kenneth Brooks WorthingtonMaybe firstly, given the enthusiasm we're seeing for your investment capabilities and the greater breadth of products that you have today versus a couple of years ago, we've been thinking about P10 being able to attract bigger LPs, bigger checks and ultimately some bigger funds. How are you seeing the aggregation of your various investment capabilities leading to that thesis maybe even being correct? Or are we sort of outside the realm of reasonableness thinking that, that's sort of the direction that your business is going to head to?Clayton Clark WebbYes, Ken, this is Clark. It's a great question. I'll touch on part of it, and I'm sure the team can jump in as well. I think that -- I would say a couple of things. The first is we are thrilled by the fact that we hit our $5 billion of guidance that we set out in the fourth quarter of 2021 when the skies were blue and the markets were strong. Little did we know that we would have 6 quarters of record rises in interest rates and record drop in stock prices and here we are 6 quarters in, still 2 quarters ahead of time. And we've not just crossed the $5 billion, we've done it quite handily. So congratulations to the team. I think it is a testament to the power of the platform and not being reliant on any one vertical or any one strategy. I would say that's point 1.Point 2, it's a great point. We should given our breadth of manufacturing and the fact that we are very unique. There is not another engine that looks like us in investment manufacturing, we should be able to attract larger LPs with larger check sizes over time. That is a long sales cycle, and it has certainly not been the easiest 6 quarters to be having a dialogue, but we are absolutely in dialogue. I still think we're in the bottom of the first inning with respect to what we think we can do over the next many years, but it's a long baseball game.The good news is we are firing on all cylinders as we progress through that game. So the fact that we had to raise -- we were able to raise the hard cap twice for the secondaries fund, and we still had oversubscription at that point. And if you look at the fund size between Secondary Fund IV and Secondary Fund III, it was near doubling, that's very encouraging. When we look at our GP stake strategy, the target of $1.25 billion is nearly 2x what Fund I was, very encouraging.We obviously have some well-known funds that will be in the market next year, and we fully expect to have success there. So I think we are doing the things that we need to do to grow at a strong double-digit rate. The thing that gives me excitement is when you ask the question, I am not yet ready to say, Ken, we're there, we're landing the $1 billion SMAs. I would like for us to get there. I think we can. It's still going to take time. But while we're planting seeds, we've got great things coming at the underlying verticals.Kenneth Brooks WorthingtonBrilliant. I want to follow up on step downs. Would you consider 2023 to be unusual from a fee step-down perspective? Maybe remind us where you see step-downs where you don't? And what -- assuming 2023 is not typical. What should normal look like each year from sort of the step-down perspective?Amanda Nethery CoussensKen, so for step-downs for 2023, it is a bit unusual and that we had the WTI step down this year. And that step down is expected to occur only every 3 years. So that's where you're seeing a bit higher step down in exploration for 2023.Mark C. HoodYes. And Ken, as we think about it on a normalized basis, we're managing north of $20 billion. We say our average duration is around 9 years at inception of the fund, and we are growing at a good clip. And so the idea of having step-downs and expirations of around $1.5 billion a year is not outrageous. Some years, it will be closer to 1. It is possible you can get north of 1.5 as well. As we get bigger, those step downs will grow, but that's a good problem to have.And then the other thing is we do tell the vast majority of our fee paying AUM, we are receiving management fees on the committed dollars, which gives us a tremendous amount of visibility into our fees over time. There are some strategies where it's on deployed dollars. And then when you sell investments, you lose that fee-paying AUM. In the quarter we had some nice realizations in the impact business. And so we actually had more expirations than we expected, but that's always a good thing when you can realize a good investment.So it will toggle between that low single-digit billion all the way up to 2. But again, as we grow over time or we lengthen -- as we go over time, it should grow, if we can lengthen the average duration that will help provide some ballast against it.OperatorOur next question is from Michael Cyprys with MS.Michael J. CyprysI want to come back to some of the commentary we're hearing from others across the industry, just on banks retrenching, creating opportunity for private lenders to step in. Maybe you could just give us a little bit of a flavor for the different parts of your platform where you guys could participate. Where do you see the biggest opportunity across your platform?And maybe you could talk about some of the steps that you are and might take over the next 12 months to further capitalize on this opportunity set. And any thoughts on how meaningful this could be if you're able to quantify that for PTA?Mark C. HoodYes, it's a great question. We are fortunate to be in the sweet spot in a couple of our markets where the opportunity set is better than it's ever been. Those verticals primarily are in our venture debt business. Obviously, with the news of the largest venture debt bank in the spring, having issues that has created a very unique competitive environment.NAV lending, we really do dominate the lower middle market. And when you have high interest rates and a tougher realization market, drawing additional capital through a NAV long allows private equity GPs to continue to deploy capital into their portfolio to try to accelerate value growth over time. So we have an extraordinary pipeline there.And then even in our impact business, our impact business is in 3 different verticals. Two of the verticals, we think we are extremely unique from the inflation Reduction Act the idea that there is a tremendous amount of capital going into renewable energy and then also impact real estate brown field and green field real estate projects to clean up the environment.But then the third is actually small business lending. So we have a 20-year track record of originating small business loans to minority-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, women-owned businesses. I think we have a 20-year loss rate that you measure in the almost double-digit basis points cumulative. I think it's just over triple digits, but don't hold me to that. And so we are seeing extraordinary demand there as well.I think the real challenge for us over the next 12 months is going to be raising capital to fifth the demand. In venture credit, we see a great opportunity, in NAV lending, we see a great opportunity, in impact credit, we see a great opportunity. We still continue to see a great opportunity in our SBIC credit vintage, which really does take the place of a bank. And so we might see an acceleration in the raise of Fund V there. Fund IV is currently deploying quite nicely.The key for us in 2024 is going to be raising capital behind those strategies. These are niche strategies. We love that because we think they're protected most to generate great returns, but it also means there's more of an education on the LP front. And so we do believe the more conversations we have, we're convinced that we've got great manufacturing, and we hope to be landing wins over the next 12 months.Michael J. CyprysAnd which of those strategies will you say is more scalable, just given your focus on the lower and middle market space? Question often comes up just around how do you sort of navigate any sort of potential constraints on growth given you're not looking at the larger part of the marketplace. Are there parts of your business where you are looking at the larger part of the marketplace? And how do you sort of navigate around such that this doesn't constrain your growth?Mark C. HoodYes. We don't need to be in the larger part of the marketplace because we really dominate these 3 verticals, and they are very large verticals, if you just look at SVB and venture debt, they were tens of billions of dollars in terms of size. So there is a very large hole in that market. NAV lending is growing leaps and bounds and then look at the trillions that are coming through the inflation Reduction Act. So of all the things we're worried about scalability in those 3 verticals is the least of our concerns. It really is raising the capital to fund these strategies. These are such unique risk-adjusted returns.Our NAV lending business really acts like an investment-grade bond despite having a return that's literally 2x what you get in an investment-grade bond. Our venture debt strategy has a loss rate that looks like a high-yield bond despite a return profile that is 2 to 3x what a high-yield bond returns. And then our impact credit, in many cases, we're lending against tax equity, which is basically government guaranteed and generating an 11% or 12% return. So again, 100 for a 2x increase on the risk-adjusted return relative to an underlying treasury. We feel like we have the product. There's plenty of room for us to grow. The key is going to be finding those large SMAs, finding those LPs that want to put real money to work, and that's what we're focused on.Michael J. CyprysGreat. And just a follow-up, if I could, on the fee rate. I think it was like 104 basis points in the quarter. I mean, is that the right one way to kind of think about on a go-forward basis here? Just any help on the (inaudible) 0:27:30 catch-ups.Amanda Nethery CoussensYes, generally about $105 million is I believe what we've guided to.OperatorOur next question is from Ben Budish with Barclays.Benjamin Elliot BudishI was wondering if you can kind of revisit the original $5 billion kind of maybe explain a little bit, like where did you surprise so much to the upside? And then kind of alongside that, I think last quarter, the guidance was a strong second half of the year. I think you indicated that maybe it wouldn't be quite as half in the second quarter, but is that still sort of your expectation if we look on maybe the average over the last couple of quarters, should the second half of this year still be like relatively strong?Mark C. HoodYes. When you think about the original $5 billion target, we rarely -- I don't know if we ever in our projection models, have fund sizes that double intra fund. So when we talk about a secondary fund going from $400 million to $800 million, when we talk about a GP Stakes fund going from $650 million to $1.25 billion. Those are wins for the home team. So we had a -- we were just having a number of those happen across the board. And then we're also -- we are winning SMA business, especially in our private equity vertical, and that's something we don't really factor in when we think about cadence for fundraises. That is the -- that's the first question. Can you remind me of the second?Benjamin Elliot BudishIt was the outlook for the back half of the year, the original guidance was a stronger back half than the first half, but then obviously, the second quarter surprised to the upside. So perhaps the second -- the back half is not going to be quite as strong. But to what extent was the second quarter as a result of maybe some funds from the third quarter being pulled in early? Or do you still expect the second half to be relatively strong, but perhaps not quite as strong as the second quarter.Mark C. HoodYes, well, we definitely wanted to call out. The second quarter was a record quarter, which I don't know many folks who are able to produce that in the second quarter, a record fundraising quarter. So we're certainly proud of that. We would not anticipate continuing to eclipse our record quarters in the third and fourth quarter. We did call out in the script, we have 2 decent-sized strategies in the market, one being GP stakes and the other being our TrueBridge Fund VIII. We are very excited about those strategies, whether that capital comes in, in the third quarter or the fourth quarter or the first quarter or even the second quarter, we are less focused on. We'll obviously recoup all of those management fees with catch-up.So we certainly have the potential to keep showing growth in Q3 and Q4 that is just fine. But a lot of it's going to come down to those 2 strategies. And we are -- we see very strong demand in those strategies. So we feel good about them. Whether they're in Q3 or Q4 or maybe Q1, we're less focused on.Benjamin Elliot BudishGot it. That's helpful. Maybe one follow-up on the secondary strategy. Is there any -- so with RCP, obviously, with the fund of funds, we see you coming to the market every year. Any thought on the secondary funds piece of that speeding up? Or is what we've been seeing the last couple of funds sort of the right cadence? And then along the same lines, maybe except for RCP, in secondaries in general, I think right now you're only in private equity. And we're starting to see some of your kind of larger publicly traded peers launch secondary funds and incremental sort of asset classes. So any thoughts in terms of expanding the secondaries to real estate infrastructure or credit anywhere else like that?William Fritz SouderYes. This is Fritz. I can take all back to working with the teams directly on this. Proud to say that we actually just started doing secondaries of the venture world. It's a first-time fund, which is always a little bit harder to do. But early indications are that we should be able to reach our target on that fund. So we're starting to launch that certainly in that area. We continue to see a lot of interest in secondaries. And so both from the fundraising side, you would just see in the deployment side.Whether that will come up quicker, I think the average pace on secondaries, I think through the history has been about every 3-ish years. That's probably where we would see this from when we started deploying capital, which was about a year ago. So I could -- don't hold me to this in a (inaudible) 0:32:07, but I could see that strategy coming back to market here in 2025, most likely.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Brown with KBW.Michael C. BrownOkay. Great. So I appreciate the -- that you certainly have a very compelling strategic mix today. So M&amp;A is certainly not necessary for your strategy going forward here. But I'd just like to hear a little bit about what you're seeing in the M&amp;A environment, how you think about your strategy now that you do have a diversified scale business? And then if something does come across that's transformational. How would you approach that from a leverage perspective? What's kind of your constraints there?Clayton Clark WebbYes. If you -- we talk about this all the time. If you think about where we are today, we really are in 3 verticals: lower middle market private equity, venture capital and lower middle market impact. Within those verticals, we cover the capital stack, all the way from the junior most equity to the senior most debt, and we like to think we dominate those verticals with track records that are measured in decades, not years or quarters. And then beyond that, we have our GP Stakes business that we think is very synergistic because as we live in these lower middle market verticals and see GPs that we believe are going to be the next 3-letter name on the New York Stock Exchange, we love the opportunity to take a stake in those.So the ecosystem today is very unique, and we think, works really, really well and produces investment returns that are truly differentiated. We also believe having now been in these verticals now for a while that we don't need to do another acquisition to be a much larger business than we are today. The markets are big enough. Our manufacturing, we think is good enough. We are constantly trying to innovate, launching new strategies within the same vertical. Fritz mentioned it going into secondaries on the venture side. Obviously, some of our peers have had a lot of success there.So we're constantly trying to innovate and do more in the things we do well. All that being said, it is a very high bar for us at this point to bring on a new strategy or a new vertical, but we are constantly in discussion. We are not the type of firm that is jumping at every banker-led process. Frankly, if a GP is looking to sell, we're probably not the right partner. Most of our deals, the vast majority are unbanked and they're really based on relationships and marriages. And that's the way we think about it. And so we have dialogue right now, seeds that we planted years ago that we still reach out to and talk to folks that we just met in the last handful of months. Those conversations are always ongoing. We have no idea when one will strike. We'd be surprised if nothing strikes over the next couple of years. And we would not be surprised at multiple things strike. But it really is -- it's a relationship building. These are not bank deals.And given our track record at this point and the asset classes that we're in, I would just reiterate, it's a high bar. We would love for it to be both of confirmation and excellence when GPs actually elect to join our platform because they're in a good crowd.William Fritz SouderOkay. This is Fritz. Add one thing to that what Clark just said, which we're seeing, these are marriages, right? And most of the deals we're looking at are not banked at all. So we take our time getting to know the teams and the strategies. And one of the things we're seeing in the private equity a little bit is people not -- other firms now being successful in the fundraising that we've seen inside our own verticals. So it's one of the reasons we're very proud of our group that they're outperforming right now and raising a lot of capital where we have seen others that have not maybe hit some of their numbers. So we just continue to hang around and continue to port them and date them, and we're move when the time is right.Amanda Nethery CoussensIn terms -- you also asked about funding acquisitions. So I just wanted to add that the acquisition would be funded with a mix of cash, stock and earn-outs as we have in the past. And we have about $98.5 million available on our credit facility currently.OperatorOur last question is from John Campbell with Stephens Inc.Unidentified AnalystThis is (inaudible) 0:37:23 stepping on for John. Congrats on the quarter. For WTI, the goal is obviously to raise the next fund in 2024. And I think generally, it has been expected by us and maybe some investors to see that fund size jump up maybe $40 million to $50 million like we've seen over the last couple of the fund raises, just incremental step-ups there. So, question on that, given the macro, obviously, WTI now being part of P10 and maybe some other factors such as (inaudible) 0:37:55 failure.The question is, is roughly like a $550 million fundraising goal for Fund XI now is somewhat on the conservative side of things. Additionally, can you maybe size up the potential impact of this WTI fundraising on overall P10 average fee rates and EBITDA margins maybe next year?Clayton Clark WebbYes. So I would say it's too early to tell on the fund size. We certainly would prefer not to go backwards in terms of fund size. And the good news in terms of how WTI deploys capital, they will turn on their next fund and still be deploying from their predecessor funds. And so in some ways, if we raised a little more, maybe we turn on the fund after that Fund XII a little later, if we raise a little less, than a much bigger number than we just turned on Fund XII earlier. So there's a cadence in terms of deployment. Our fundraising is really driven by deployment.As we noted, we feel like the deployment environment today is better than it's ever been. And so that would lead us to certainly hope that the fund size can grow Fund X to Fund XI. We are having a dialogue at this point, and we have talked about that Q1 as a first close. So I would say it's a little too soon to tell. We do not believe there's another venture debt player out there that looks like us. We are excited about introducing WTI to a number of new LPs. It is not an easy time to raise money in venture. It really is extraordinary what TrueBridge has been able to do, and we think WTI will do as well.But venture allocations have gone down a lot this year in terms of net new commitments. But we are aligning WTI up to be as successful as they can be. Certainly feel like we can deploy more money in this next month than we had in the prior fund.Unidentified AnalystGreat. And then, obviously, there's no M&amp;A in the quarter or buyback if we did pay down a bit of the revolver. And I know you guys just kind of talked through M&amp;A a bit there, but can you talk perhaps to your preferred capital allocation avenue here, how you're thinking about balancing all 3 of those options?Clayton Clark WebbSure. Great question. When we look at our -- with interest rates going up so much, our cost of debt is up near 7.7%. When we think about capital allocation, when we don't have any imminent M&amp;A, we obviously have all this free cash flow and a dividend that's easily covered. So our choice is to buy back stock or pay down debt. When we think about valuations and return on incremental capital, even today, it's probably accretive to buy back stock. But the optionality, given that rates are -- interest rates are so high relative to where they were that incremental return on capital by buying back stock (inaudible) 0:40:56 liquidity, which we hear loud and clear from investors that we need more liquidity in the marketplace.And secondly, by being able to pay down debt, that continues to give us optionality as we see opportunities on the M&amp;A front to relever and take that back up to make an accretive acquisition. So that's how we think about it.OperatorThere are no additional questions waiting. So I'll pass the conference back to the management team for any closing remarks.Clayton Clark WebbThank you, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to seeing you at the -- at any of your conferences. Obviously, we're around to take questions.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in United Rentals (URI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to URI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?United Rentals' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at United Rentals' main business drivers.Headquartered in Stamford, CT, United Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of 1,543 rental locations in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Moreover, it operates in 49 U.S. states and every Canadian province. The company offers 4,800 classes of equipment for rent at a total original equipment cost (“OEC”) of $20.6 billion (as of Jun 30, 2023).The company’s customer base includes construction and industrial companies, utilities, municipalities, government agencies, independent contractors and homeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations. The company’s principal products and services are equipment rental, sale of rental equipment, new equipment, contractor supplies, services and other.United Rentals serves customers as a single-source solution, provided through two business segments: General Rentals and Specialty or Trench, Power and Fluid Solutions.General Rentals (accounted for 73.7% of total revenues in 2022) includes the rental of construction, aerial and industrial equipment, general tools and light equipment, along with related services and activities. The segment includes the rental of the following: i) general construction and industrial equipment ii) aerial work platforms and iii) general tools and light equipment. The general rentals segment is comprised of four geographic divisions - Central, Northeast, Southeast and West - and operates throughout the United States and Canada.Story continuesSpecialty (26.3%) includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services like trench safety equipment, power and HVAC equipment, and fluid solutions equipment.On Jan 25, 2023, the company unveiled a dividend program wherein the board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For United Rentals, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in August 2013 would be worth $8,682.45, or a 768.24% gain, as of August 11, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 164.21% and gold's return of 40% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for URI.United Rentals reported impressive second-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7% and 3.5%, respectively. Also, earnings and revenues grew year over year by 25.7% and 28.3%, respectively.

Furthermore, in the quarter, the company opened 19 new cold-start locations and is on track of opening 40 specialty cold-starts by 2023.

Solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP bodes well.Oracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is delivering better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. Partnerships with NVIDIA and Microsoft benefits Oracle. Oracle is partnering with NVIDIA to build the world's largest high-performance computer, an AI computer, with 16,000 GPUs.The company also announced that it is launching a generative AI cloud service for enterprise customers.

The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we saw CVX’s EPS jump 132% in 2022.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Linde shares have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the past year (+24.6% vs. +4.5%), reflecting favorable outlook for industrial gases. The company’s primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages. Linde reported strong second quarter earnings aided by higher pricing from its Americas segment.However, declining free cashflow is a concern, reflecting weakness in operating activities. Moreover, the company is extremely vulnerable to uncertainty associated with the slowdown of economic growth, as this could hurt demand for its industrial gases.(You can read the full research report on Linde here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Walt Disney Company (DIS), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY) and Airbnb, Inc.

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip stocks, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Out of these, a mere handful manages to catch public attention due to a variety of factors. These firms can either be popular household names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), firms that have created new industries like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or companies that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and are known for their financial stability and strength.Firms at the top of the stock market food chain are often referred to as Blue Chip stocks. The term 'Blue Chip' is more than a century old, and as you might have guessed, it comes from poker where players assign a monetary value to chips and then gamble on them with cards. A blue chip stock in the 1920s would typically have a share price greater than $200 and the term was coined by a reporter for Dow Jones. These days, there are no fixed criteria to define a firm as a blue chip, however, the typical classification normally includes the 30 stocks included in the Dow 30 index.Investing in blue chip stocks typically offers a variety of benefits that one might be unable to accrue when investing in other stocks such as penny stocks or small cap stocks. These firms are typically quite resilient to significant share price drops due to their size and stability, and their popularity also provides the market with plenty of liquidity. Not to mention, several blue chip stocks also pay dividends. We took a closer look at blue chip firms with large market capitalization and stable dividend growth as part of our 12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy coverage and determined that the top dividend paying stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesAugust is an important month for the stock market as it will see several large firms report their earnings for the second quarter of 2023. These earnings come at a time when high interest rates take their toll on corporate spending, but lowering inflation provides consumers with more leeway to make expensive purchases. To add to this, the earnings also provide important hints about the current state of the U.S. economy, to enable analysts and economists to determine whether a recession might materialize just when everybody starts looking the other way.One blue chip stock that reported its earnings in August is Apple. The largest technology company in the world saw its quarterly revenue drop for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the revenue for the first three quarters also fell. However, Apple still beat analyst EPS estimates due to lower costs in administrative and other expenses. Another blue chip firm and one whose sales are closely watched to measure consumer spending power is Coca-Cola. It is the largest beverage company in the world and one that had a strong second quarter as it managed to beat analyst EPS estimates by a wide margin. Coca-Cola reported $12 billion in net revenues for the quarter, which marked a 6% annual growth. The results indicated that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation, and the revenue growth also enabled Coca-Cola to report a 34% GAAP EPS growth.However, for the beverages company, the biggest takeaway from its second quarter of 2023 earnings was not the revenue or the EPS figures. Instead, it was Coca-Cola's guidance, as the company upgraded its non-GAAP revenue guidance to predict an 8% to 9% organic growth for the full year 2023. Corporate guidance is a crucial factor in an earnings season like the one we're currently in the middle of. This is because firms have a real time view of their operations which leaves them in a better position to predict future outcomes. These outcomes, when put together, can also provide the tea leaves to make a prediction of the broader economic performance.Joining Coca-Cola as an important company whose earnings guidance and financial performance are also an economic barometer is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The retailer has direct contact with consumers due to its business model, and while it has not reported its latest earnings, investment bank Credit Suisse has some good news for the stock as it has increased Walmart's share price target to $180 from $170. Credit Suisse believes that Walmart is positioned well to handle any volatility in consumer spending as its entire approach is based on providing customers with value.With this context, let's take a look at the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to Wall Street. The stocks leading the pack are The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street AnalystsNorthfoto / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to analysts, we calculated the share price upside for blue chip companies based on their average share price target data from Yahoo Finance.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Prologis in FocusPrologis (PLD) is headquartered in San Francisco, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 8.37% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.87 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.85%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield is 4.65%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.62%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.48 is up 10.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Prologis has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 13.43%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Prologis's current payout ratio is 58%. This means it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, PLD expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.58 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 8.14%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, PLD is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PriceMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. price | Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. QuoteFactors Supporting Dividend HikesMartin Marietta is a prominent American provider of construction aggregates essential for constructing highways, infrastructure ventures, as well as residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. The company's strategic focus revolves around leveraging the core demand drivers in public construction endeavors. Furthermore, Martin Marietta has been actively broadening its reach and offerings through consistent acquisitions, thereby enhancing its operational scope and portfolio diversity.During the second-quarter conference call, Ward Nye, chairman and CEO of MLM, stated, “We continue to see solid near-term product demand reinforced by healthy customer backlogs across our coast-to-coast footprint, led by infrastructure and heavy non-residential projects of scale. We expect recent legislation and the resulting enhanced level of public investment in these kinds of aggregates-intensive end-use projects to support continued strong demand for several years to come. While single-family residential construction has slowed, builder sentiment has improved in Martin Marietta geographies as the single-family housing shortage continues to drive a base level of demand in our key Sun Belt markets. We also expect to see an uptick in residential activity as mortgage rates stabilize over the next several months.”As of Jun 30, 2023, Martin Marietta had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $421.5 million compared with $358 million at 2022-end. Also, it had $1.20 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities at June-end. Long-term debt (excluding current maturities) was $4.343 billion, up slightly from $4.341 billion at 2022-end. Net cash provided by operations was $518.5 million for the first six months, up from $286.2 million in the year-ago period.The company has been regularly enhancing shareholders’ returns through repurchases and dividends, given its stable balance sheet scenario and solid prospects. In the second quarter of 2023, MLM returned $116 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Since the company’s repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, it has returned a total of $2.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. As on Jun 30, 2023, the company had $1.20 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility.Given solid second-quarter results and expectations for an even stronger next six months, the company also lifted its full-year adjusted EBITDA expectation.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksMartin Marietta currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks from the Construction sector are EMCOR Group, Inc.

MDLZ has been capitalizing on its expansion endeavors, primarily through strategic acquisitions and efficient pricing strategies. The company's concerted focus on the chocolate and biscuit categories has yielded significant gains.Despite facing cost challenges, Mondelez has demonstrated resilience, with its shares up 11.3% over the past six months, outpacing the industry's growth of 0.6%. The company raised its guidance for 2023 when it reported robust second-quarter results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.A Look at Q2 &amp; BeyondSecond-quarter results gained from broad-based strength in the company’s business, with solid profitable top-line growth across all regions and categories. Continuous reinvestments in its brands and capabilities along with effective pricing actions, cost discipline and a solid volume/mix fueled performance. Adjusted earnings were 76 cents per share, increasing 16.9% year over year and 21.5% on a constant-currency (cc) basis.Net revenues advanced 17% year over year to $8,507 million. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,194.2 million. The uptick was driven by strong organic net revenue growth of 15.8% and increased sales from the Clif Bar and Ricolino buyouts. Favorable pricing contributed to organic net revenues.Mondelez expects 2023 organic net revenue growth of more than 12% compared with the growth of more than 10% projected earlier. Management anticipates adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth on a cc basis of more than 12%. The company had earlier expected the metric to grow more than 10%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBoosting Growth Through AcquisitionsMondelez's growth trajectory has been propelled by a series of acquisitions. The acquisition of Ricolino (concluded in the third quarter of 2023) is projected to double the size of MDLZ’s Mexican operations, while the Clif Bar buyout (August 2022) has further strengthened the company’s market presence. Contributions from the Ricolino and Clif Bar buyouts boosted net revenues in the second quarter of 2023.The integration of Chipita S.A. and Grenade (in 2022) showcases Mondelez's commitment to enhancing its product offerings. The acquisition spree, further underscored by Gourmet Food Holdings and Hu Master Holdings, has diversified Mondelez's portfolio and augmented its distribution capabilities.Story continuesConcentrating on Core StrengthsMondelez's strategic focus on core categories, particularly chocolates and biscuits, has proven to be a prudent move. Shifting consumer preferences toward snacking over traditional meals has helped Mondelez capitalize on these enduring categories.The resilience of chocolates and biscuits, regarded as affordable indulgences and beloved snacking choices, remains evident in both developed and emerging markets. Both these categories registered double-digit growth in the second quarter.  Management expects solid volume momentum for both these categories as it moves forward in 2023.Navigating Cost Challenges, Ensuring GrowthMondelez's growth narrative has not been all that smooth, with cost inflation emerging as a significant hurdle. In the second quarter of 2023, the adjusted gross profit margin contracted 50 basis points (bps) to 37.5% due to increased raw material and transportation costs. Also, the adjusted operating income margin was partly hurt by inflated input costs. In its second-quarter 2023 earnings release, Mondelez stated that it still expects a double-digit increase in inflation stemming from the continued elevated cost of packaging, ingredients and labor.However, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's proactive pricing strategies to combat these challenges have been proving beneficial. The positive impact of these efforts was reflected in organic net revenue growth in the second quarter of 2023. Mondelez’s strategic expansion, coupled with its steadfast focus on core snacking categories and effective cost management, positions the company for sustained growth amid a dynamic landscape.3 Appetizing TreatsSome better-ranked consumer staple stocks are Post Holdings POST, The J.M.

Despite these positive movements, the stock's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at 5.89, leading to questions about its valuation. Is Occidental Petroleum overvalued? This article aims to answer this question by diving into a comprehensive valuation analysis of the company.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Sign with NWSA. Click here to check it out. OXY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of OXYOccidental Petroleum Corp is an independent exploration and production company with operations across the United States, Latin America, and the Middle East. As of the end of 2022, the company reported net proved reserves of 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The net production averaged 1,159 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022, with a ratio of 75% oil and natural gas liquids and 25% natural gas. The company's stock price stands at $65.23, while the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $50.78.Is Occidental Petroleum Modestly Overvalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock, derived from GuruFocus's exclusive method. The GF Value Line gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.At its current price of $65.23 per share and the market cap of $57.70 billion, Occidental Petroleum stock appears to be modestly overvalued. Because Occidental Petroleum is relatively overvalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth.Story continuesIs Occidental Petroleum Modestly Overvalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationFinancial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's essential to review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Occidental Petroleum has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.02, ranking worse than 92.61% of companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Occidental Petroleum's financial strength as 5 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Is Occidental Petroleum Modestly Overvalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Occidental Petroleum has been profitable 6 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $31.50 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $5.89. Its operating margin is 29.55%, which ranks better than 72.91% of companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Occidental Petroleum at 7 out of 10, which indicates fair profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term stock performance of a company. A faster-growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Occidental Petroleum is 12.3%, which ranks better than 54.63% of companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 33.1%, which ranks better than 71.67% of companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, Occidental Petroleum's return on invested capital is 10.98, and its cost of capital is 9.02.Is Occidental Petroleum Modestly Overvalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Occidental Petroleum appears to be modestly overvalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks better than 71.67% of companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.

That includes a $35 million government procurement program for carbon removal credits, and funding for 14 feasibility studies and five engineering and design studies for earlier-stage hub projects.Worsening climate change and inadequate efforts to cut emissions have thrust carbon removal into the spotlight. U.N. scientists estimate billions of tons of carbon must be sucked out of the atmosphere annually to keep in line with a global goal to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.DAC, when deployed at scale, can help the U.S. meet its goal of neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, according to the DOE.But the young technology needs to become much cheaper quickly to roll out at the scale needed to affect the planet.""If we deploy this at scale, this technology can help us make serious headway toward our net-zero emissions goals while we are still focused on deploying, deploying, deploying more clean energy at the same time,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters.The grants, which will require some negotiations before disbursement, are the first made by the Energy Department, which got $3.5 billion from Congress to invest in regional DAC hubs from the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill.Story continuesVicki Hollub, CEO of Oxy, told reporters that the project has the potential to remove up to 30 million tons of CO2 per year when fully operational and ""validates our readiness, technical maturity, and our ability to use Oxy's expertise in large projects.""DAC uses chemical reactions to remove CO2 from the air, which can then be stored underground or used in products such as concrete or aviation fuel.Climeworks said its hub will be built in several stages with an eventual 1 million tons per year capacity by 2030 and construction starting as soon as possible.“It depends on multiple factors, but I would wish to have first capture in 2025/2026,” Jan Wurzbacher, Climeworks director and founder, told Reuters. Heirloom CEO Shashank Samala said he hoped to hit a million tons per year by 2029 or 2030.""Just two years ago, we were in a petri dish where we were removing grams of CO2 from the air,"" Samala said. Now the company is doing tons and aiming soon for hundreds and thousands of tons per year.""If we continue this pace of exponential growth every year, I think a billion tons a year is definitely, definitely achievable.""Both CEOs said factors such as the timeline of the permitting process would be key to the process.Although most environmental activists acknowledge that carbon removal will be needed for global climate targets to be met, they are concerned companies could use carbon removal development to give fossil fuel companies cover to maintain production, especially in minority and low-income areas.The announcement comes just over three months before the COP28 climate summit, where the host country, the United Arab Emirates, is expected to focus on the role of carbon removal technologies.This month, its national oil company ADNOC and Occidental agreed to evaluate investment opportunities in DAC in the United States and overseas.Erin Burns, director of carbon removal advisory firm Carbon180, said the United States is positioning itself as a leader in this technology.""This is the first major federal investment from any country on carbon removal at this level,"" Burns said. ""The U.S. is making a very large bet on this technology.""

You can skip our detailed discussion on dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. While it's tempting to focus on the largest dividends or highest yields, cash flow shows how sustainable the dividends are. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some of the best dividend stocks with sustainable dividends and decades-long dividend growth streaks.Despite the strong recovery of the stock market in 2023, several dividend stocks have faced challenges. This is because the market's recent surge has mainly favored companies related to artificial intelligence. Sectors like healthcare, energy, and financial services, which usually offer reliable and lasting dividend returns, have not performed as well in comparison. However, experts suggest that investors shouldn’t overreact to this temporary decline. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist for Morningstar Indexes, spoke about dividend stocks and their potential comeback in his recent interview. Here are some remarks from the analyst:“Overall, dividend performance this year has been lackluster. The great thing about dividend investing is that it’s got a great track record. Plus, investors get paid while they wait for performance to turn around.”Mr. Lefkovitz’s statement agrees with the historical performance of dividend stocks as they represented over 40% of the stock market's total gains from 1930 to 2022. Specifically, the performance of dividend stocks remains stable during periods of high-interest rates. Last year, dividend stocks outperformed the broader market when the US Federal Reserve hiked interest rates seven times.Also read: 11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyAccording to a paper published by Morningstar in July 2023, during high-interest rate periods like the mid-1970s in the US, stocks that paid dividends performed better than the overall market. When interest rates decreased from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, the performance of stocks with high yields compared to the market was flat. However, when the Feds lowered rates in the late 1990s due to the Asian financial crisis, dividend-paying stocks didn’t benefit at all. That said, the impact of interest rates on dividend stocks is hard to predict.Story continuesIn view of this discussion, we will focus on monthly dividend stocks to buy according to analysts.14 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy According to AnalystsPhoto by lucas Favre on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we first screened for monthly dividend stocks with yields above 3%, as of August 6.

If you want to skip our introduction to blue chip stocks, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Out of these, a mere handful manages to catch public attention due to a variety of factors. These firms can either be popular household names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), firms that have created new industries like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or companies that bring in billions of dollars in revenue and are known for their financial stability and strength.Firms at the top of the stock market food chain are often referred to as Blue Chip stocks. The term 'Blue Chip' is more than a century old, and as you might have guessed, it comes from poker where players assign a monetary value to chips and then gamble on them with cards. A blue chip stock in the 1920s would typically have a share price greater than $200 and the term was coined by a reporter for Dow Jones. These days, there are no fixed criteria to define a firm as a blue chip, however, the typical classification normally includes the 30 stocks included in the Dow 30 index.Investing in blue chip stocks typically offers a variety of benefits that one might be unable to accrue when investing in other stocks such as penny stocks or small cap stocks. These firms are typically quite resilient to significant share price drops due to their size and stability, and their popularity also provides the market with plenty of liquidity. Not to mention, several blue chip stocks also pay dividends. We took a closer look at blue chip firms with large market capitalization and stable dividend growth as part of our 12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy coverage and determined that the top dividend paying stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesAugust is an important month for the stock market as it will see several large firms report their earnings for the second quarter of 2023. These earnings come at a time when high interest rates take their toll on corporate spending, but lowering inflation provides consumers with more leeway to make expensive purchases. To add to this, the earnings also provide important hints about the current state of the U.S. economy, to enable analysts and economists to determine whether a recession might materialize just when everybody starts looking the other way.One blue chip stock that reported its earnings in August is Apple. The largest technology company in the world saw its quarterly revenue drop for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the revenue for the first three quarters also fell. However, Apple still beat analyst EPS estimates due to lower costs in administrative and other expenses. Another blue chip firm and one whose sales are closely watched to measure consumer spending power is Coca-Cola. It is the largest beverage company in the world and one that had a strong second quarter as it managed to beat analyst EPS estimates by a wide margin. Coca-Cola reported $12 billion in net revenues for the quarter, which marked a 6% annual growth. The results indicated that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation, and the revenue growth also enabled Coca-Cola to report a 34% GAAP EPS growth.However, for the beverages company, the biggest takeaway from its second quarter of 2023 earnings was not the revenue or the EPS figures. Instead, it was Coca-Cola's guidance, as the company upgraded its non-GAAP revenue guidance to predict an 8% to 9% organic growth for the full year 2023. Corporate guidance is a crucial factor in an earnings season like the one we're currently in the middle of. This is because firms have a real time view of their operations which leaves them in a better position to predict future outcomes. These outcomes, when put together, can also provide the tea leaves to make a prediction of the broader economic performance.Joining Coca-Cola as an important company whose earnings guidance and financial performance are also an economic barometer is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The retailer has direct contact with consumers due to its business model, and while it has not reported its latest earnings, investment bank Credit Suisse has some good news for the stock as it has increased Walmart's share price target to $180 from $170. Credit Suisse believes that Walmart is positioned well to handle any volatility in consumer spending as its entire approach is based on providing customers with value.With this context, let's take a look at the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to Wall Street. The stocks leading the pack are The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street AnalystsNorthfoto / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the most undervalued blue chip stocks according to analysts, we calculated the share price upside for blue chip companies based on their average share price target data from Yahoo Finance.

According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $166.02, but it is currently trading at US$103 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Mohawk Industries’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Mohawk Industries?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted revenue growth of 6.0% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Mohawk Industries, at least in the short term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since MHK is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MHK for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MHK. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Mohawk Industries mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

(SoCalGas) today was awarded funding by the U.S. Department of Energy for a proposal to develop California's first full-scale direct air capture and storage network of regional hubs.""This is an important step in our efforts to help California decarbonize and reach net-zero goals. California's transition to net zero will require a broad portfolio of diverse energy sources and decarbonization tools to reduce emissions, including carbon management,"" said SoCalGas President Maryam Brown. ""This project could reduce one million metric tons of carbon dioxide directly from the air each year and aid in a more equitable energy transition. Our research has shown that carbon management, when combined with electrification and clean fuels, delivers the most affordable, resilient and technologically proven path to full carbon neutrality.""The U.S. Department of Energy announced that it selected the California Direct Air Capture hub for up to $11.8 million in funding to study a regional carbon management hub in Kern County. This project is among only five projects nationwide – the only projected located in California – to be selected funding to begin designing a carbon capture hub project under the department's $3.5 billion Direct Air Capture Hubs program. A total of 21 projects were selected in the announcement.The California Direct Air Capture hub is made up of a consortium of nearly 40 organizations from across industry, community, tribes, government, technology, national labs, academia, labor, and workforce development. SoCalGas will play an important role in the effort, advancing a Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) study to transport carbon captured from the air to permanent carbon storage in the region. Efforts completed to date reflect that the hub could remove 1 million or more metric tons of CO2 annually – equivalent to taking more than 220,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles off the road each year – in line with the state's 20 million metric ton carbon removal target for 2030 and 100 million metric ton carbon removal target for 2045.Story continuesThe U.S. Department of Energy's stated purpose for the proposed hub funding is to ""accelerate the commercialization of CO2 removal via integrated capture from the atmosphere, processing, transport, and secure geologic storage and/or conversion.""  In addition to capturing carbon, the DOE suggests potential benefits could also include the removal other air pollutants like particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx).There is widespread agreement among scientists and policymakers that carbon management will be necessary to achieve a cleaner future. The State of California has signaled that carbon management will be critical to its efforts to reach net-zero by 2045, with Gov. Gavin Newsom writing, ""We know from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that there is no path to carbon neutrality without carbon capture and sequestration.""Carbon management, along with other clean energy tools such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas, is a key component of the suite of tools SoCalGas has been developing as part of its overall clean energy strategy to reach-net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045.For more information about SoCalGas' carbon management efforts, visit https://www.socalgas.com/carboncapture.About SoCalGas Headquartered in Los Angeles, SoCalGas® is the largest gas distribution utility in the United States.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase LKQ's shares on or after the 16th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.28 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.10 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that LKQ has a trailing yield of 2.0% on the current share price of $53.66. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether LKQ can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for LKQ Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. LKQ paid out a comfortable 29% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 30% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that LKQ's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see LKQ's earnings per share have risen 16% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, two years ago, LKQ has lifted its dividend by approximately 4.9% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.The Bottom LineHas LKQ got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? LKQ has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. There's a lot to like about LKQ, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.So while LKQ looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for LKQ you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. For example, the The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) share price is down 39% in the last year. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 4.0%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 21% in that time. Furthermore, it's down 16% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unfortunately Estée Lauder Companies reported an EPS drop of 67% for the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 39% the share price fall. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster. Indeed, with a P/E ratio of 54.92 there is obviously some real optimism that earnings will bounce back.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.A Different PerspectiveEstée Lauder Companies shareholders are down 38% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 4.0%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Estée Lauder Companies .Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

292,d110be2c-cfa8-3565-8798-f196df74d981,EL,2023-08-12,Earnings Preview: Estee Lauder (EL) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-estee-lauder-el-140005516.html,1691762405,STORY,['EL'],"[The market expects Estee Lauder (EL) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis beauty products company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -109.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.49 billion, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.85% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Estee Lauder?For Estee Lauder, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -58.13%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Estee Lauder will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Estee Lauder would post earnings of $0.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.47, delivering a surprise of -4.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

You can skip our detailed discussion on dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. While it's tempting to focus on the largest dividends or highest yields, cash flow shows how sustainable the dividends are. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some of the best dividend stocks with sustainable dividends and decades-long dividend growth streaks.Despite the strong recovery of the stock market in 2023, several dividend stocks have faced challenges. This is because the market's recent surge has mainly favored companies related to artificial intelligence. Sectors like healthcare, energy, and financial services, which usually offer reliable and lasting dividend returns, have not performed as well in comparison. However, experts suggest that investors shouldn’t overreact to this temporary decline. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist for Morningstar Indexes, spoke about dividend stocks and their potential comeback in his recent interview. Here are some remarks from the analyst:“Overall, dividend performance this year has been lackluster. The great thing about dividend investing is that it’s got a great track record. Plus, investors get paid while they wait for performance to turn around.”Mr. Lefkovitz’s statement agrees with the historical performance of dividend stocks as they represented over 40% of the stock market's total gains from 1930 to 2022. Specifically, the performance of dividend stocks remains stable during periods of high-interest rates. Last year, dividend stocks outperformed the broader market when the US Federal Reserve hiked interest rates seven times.Also read: 11 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to BuyAccording to a paper published by Morningstar in July 2023, during high-interest rate periods like the mid-1970s in the US, stocks that paid dividends performed better than the overall market. When interest rates decreased from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, the performance of stocks with high yields compared to the market was flat. However, when the Feds lowered rates in the late 1990s due to the Asian financial crisis, dividend-paying stocks didn’t benefit at all. That said, the impact of interest rates on dividend stocks is hard to predict.Story continuesIn view of this discussion, we will focus on monthly dividend stocks to buy according to analysts.14 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy According to AnalystsPhoto by lucas Favre on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we first screened for monthly dividend stocks with yields above 3%, as of August 6.

However, the unsettled office market could temporarily dampen the desire for office properties, impacting leasing activity to a certain degree. The challenge is compounded by elevated interest rates, which contribute to the company's current challenges.Vornado's focus on select high-rent, high-barrier markets, along with a diversified tenant base, is projected to ensure consistent cash flow and sustained growth. While rental revenues may moderate in 2023-2024, we estimate a 7.6% year-over-year improvement in 2025.Employment growth in office sectors, enhanced space efficiency and the expansion of tech, finance and media firms are set to bolster rental revenues in the coming periods. New York continues to attract office occupiers aiming to expand their workspace.Elevated rents in recently built or excellently revitalized properties, featuring ample amenities in well-connected areas, have surged. Vornado, adept at providing premium office spaces through its redevelopment initiatives, is poised to capitalize on this emerging trend effectively.With a concentration on enhancing its primary operations, Vornado is actively engaged in targeted expansions and divestitures, along with strategic business spin-offs. These deliberate divestitures furnish the company with the necessary resources to reinvest in advantageous development and revitalization projects. VNO entered into an agreement to dispose of four Manhattan retail properties for $100 million in late July 2023. In July 2023, it disposed of The Armory Show in New York for $24.4 million.Vornado has a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had $3.2 billion of liquidity. Moreover, VNO has been securing loan refinancing in recent times, enabling it to reduce interest rates on borrowings and extend debt maturities. A flexible financial position will enable it to take advantage of future investment opportunities and fund its development projects.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 20.3% in the past month against the industry’s decline of 3.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty, choppy office market conditions are expected to dampen the short-term demand for office properties, subsequently impacting leasing activity to a certain degree.Vornado is troubled by the current high interest rate setting. These elevated rates result in significant borrowing expenses for the company, potentially impacting its capacity to acquire or develop real estate assets. With a considerable debt load, Vornado's share of total debt as of Jun 30, 2023 amounted to around $10.3 billion.The company's second-quarter 2023 performance was marred by elevated net interest costs, affecting its growth in funds from operations (FFO) per share. Management foresees an extra interest expense of approximately 40 cents per share for 2023 attributed to the ongoing rise in interest rates.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL, W.P. Carey WPC and Omega Healthcare Investors OHI. Each of these companies presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Welltower’s current-year FFO per share has moved nearly 1% northward over the past month to $3.51.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for W.P. Carey’s 2023 FFO per share has moved marginally upward in the past two months to $5.36.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Omega Healthcare’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised marginally upward over the past week to $2.83.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our analysis, go directly to the 5 Countries With The Most Airports.The Global Airline Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Markets n Research, the global airline industry had a market size of $531.5 billion in 2022. The global airline industry is expected to grow to a valuation of $635.8 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.10%.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly hit the airline industry. However, with the lift of travel bans, the tourism industry has experienced a sudden boom. Experts suggest that the incidence of big data, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and IoT will only boost air travel for tourism and logistical purposes in the future.It is not a surprise that Asia Pacific dominates the airline industry. The high demand for air travel in the Asia Pacific can be attributed to the growing middle and upper-class population in Asian countries along with rapid technological development in the airline industry. While the Asia Pacific dominates the market with a 47% market share, the North American airline industry is expected to experience high growth in the coming years due to an emergence of high net worth people in the region and increased spend on research and development for aircraft manufacturing.Air travel accounts for domestic and international travel. While domestic travel dominated the market in 2022, international travel is experiencing an upward trajectory as well. Some of the major contributors to the growth include low airfare, expanding technology, and growing living standards. Some international spots have increased influx more than others. According to countries' international tourism receipts, some of the highest-ranked countries in the tourism industry are the United States, France, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.Story continuesHow is Social Media and Tech Changing the Tourism IndustryThe boom in the airline industry can be attributed to the substantial increase in the disposable income of people, the relaxation of visa policies post-COVID, the rise of remote work, easy access to information through social media, and even AI.On March 16, The New York Times reported the increasing use of AI for planning trips by travelers and tourist guides. The report cited how a tourist guide used ChatGPT to decide on activities for an upcoming trip. He mentioned that he already had those ideas in mind, but using ChatGPT allowed him to be more efficient and focus on the logistical tasks instead. The report cites a Professor from the University of Washington to emphasize the potential Artificial Intelligence has to transform the tourism industry. For instance, AI could help tourists and travelers pick appropriate hotels, places, and restaurants. Moreover, tourism companies can also provide their customers with a virtual tour of places before they are officially taken there.On April 25, Bloomberg reported how the incidence of remote work has fueled the tourism industry. Bloomberg cited a report by Deloitte's 2023 Travel Outlook, suggesting that people who could bring work with them on trips were twice as likely to travel. The article emphasizes that the lines between remote workers and tourists are blurred, enabling people to earn and travel at the same time.On May 26, CNBC reported that the tourism industry is expected to grow to $2.7 trillion by 2025 from a valuation of $1.5 trillion in 2019; Instagram was recognized as a major contributor to the growth. CNBC also cited another survey by Expedia highlighting that almost 30% of American travelers were inspired or influenced by social media to plan a good vacation. Additionally, the report suggests that Instagram users were more likely to travel than non-users. Social media has also allowed people to learn about different cultures from the comfort of their homes. Not only has this increased demand for tourism, but it has ignited a want to exist and experience different cultures firsthand. Some of the best destinations for cultural tourism include the Lakes of Amsterdam, the Tower of London, Westminster, Rome, and Paris.Smart airports are the next big thing in the world. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the North American Smart Airport market has an estimated valuation of $443.84 million in 2023 and is expected to reach a valuation of $835.27 million by 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.48%. Smart Airports have most of their operations automated. For instance, some examples include sensors to monitor temperature and lighting, smart baggage tags, and biometric check-ins. Market leaders in the smart airport industry include Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).World's Best Airline CompaniesWith the rapid growth in the tourism and airline industry, airline companies have been tasked with exceeding customer expectations. More than just five-star meals and entertainment is required. Some airline companies are leading the way with rapid innovation and technological advancements. Some of them include Singapore Airlines Limited (SES:C6L.SI), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL).Singapore Airlines Limited (SES:C6L) is one of the best airline companies in the world. Singapore Airlines Limited (SES:C6L.SI) frequently obtains a rating of 8.6/10 by its frequent users. On June 20, Forbes reported that Asian and Middle Eastern airlines dominated the 2023 World Airline Awards. Among them, Singapore Airlines Limited (SES:C6L) won the title of the best airline award. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) recently announced a new Delta Sync feature. As reported on July 27 by Forbes, the airline company is in the works to provide customized entertainment to its passengers. Delta Sync uses past information on customers' watch preferences to offer them movies and shows based on their likes.American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) partnered with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Breakthrough Energy to assess whether the integration of AI can reduce contrails. As reported on August 9 by Aerotime Hub, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) conducted 70 test flights over 6 months. The AI developed by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) enables crew members to be careful around altitudes with the highest possibility of contrails.The number of airports in a country is a reflection of the tourism industry of the country, which may be influenced by the area size of the country, the economic conditions, the tourist influx, and travel policies.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) share price has soared 185% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, O'Reilly Automotive achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 23% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that O'Reilly Automotive shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 30% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 23%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand O'Reilly Automotive better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with O'Reilly Automotive (including 1 which is a bit concerning) .Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Almost everyone will experience a disability at some point in their lives, and more than 40 million Americans are living with a disability today.1 But despite their ubiquity, people with disabilities are frequently marginalized, resulting in profound impacts to their physical, social, mental, and economic well-being.2In a new report published in partnership with the National Disability Institute and The Harkin Institute, we find that people with disabilities are far less likely to be Financially Healthy than those without disabilities. Our research uncovers multiple obstacles - including employment barriers, financial exclusion, and public safety net constraints - that may be undermining their financial health. This report explores the complex challenges faced by people with disabilities in their daily financial lives, while identifying several opportunities to foster equity and financial well-being across the disability community.Key FindingsJust 10% of working-age people with disabilities are Financially Healthy, compared with 30% of working-age people without disabilities. 40% of people with disabilities who weren‘t working reported that they would like to be working for pay. 93% of people with disabilities are unfamiliar with ABLE accounts, the primary tax-advantaged asset-building tool for people with disabilities. 55% of respondents to our survey of people with disabilities who used an alternative credit service said they did so because their ""credit score was too low to get a loan at a bank.""Defining DisabilityIn this report, we follow the current definition of disability set by federal surveys and classify a person as disabled if they indicate that they have serious difficulty with any one of the following:Story continuesHearingSeeing (even with glasses)Concentrating, remembering, or making decisionsWalking or climbing stairsDressing or bathingDoing errands aloneThroughout the report, we use both person-first and identity-first language, acknowledging that preferences differ and are evolving within the disability community. For a detailed explanation of how we define disability and the questions used in our surveys, please see the full report.Key Finding 1 The Disability Gap in Financial HealthPeople with disabilities are far less Financially Healthy than people without disabilities.There is a large and concerning gap in the financial health of people with and without disabilities; working-age people with disabilities are only a third as likely to be Financially Healthy as working-age people without disabilities.People with disabilities struggle with all aspects of financial health.Just half (51%) of working-age people with disabilities said they were able to pay all of their bills on time, while close to half (46%) said they have unmanageable levels of debt.Only one in five (22%) said they were confident they were on track to meet their long-term goals.The diversity of the disability community leads to a diversity in financial health experiences.37% of respondents with only hearing difficulties were Financially Healthy, much higher than all other disability types.Only 14% of people with vision difficulties, 10% of those with mobility difficulties, and a miniscule 6% of those with cognitive difficulties or multiple difficulties were Financially Healthy.Many individuals with disabilities face intersectional challenges related to other elements of their identity.Working-age women with disabilities were only half as frequently Financially Healthy as working-age men with disabilities (7% vs. 14%).Black people with disabilities were far less frequently Financially Healthy (7%) than Asian (24%), Latinx (17%), and White (22%) people with disabilities (all ages).LGBTQIA+ people with disabilities were less frequently Financially Healthy compared with non-LGBTQIA+ people with disabilities (14% vs. 20%, all ages).""[Do] I feel like my blindness has impacted my ability to make ends meet? Absolutely! I was unable to work, so I went… on disability at 39. So that's a fixed income, and we know how prices have changed over the years.""- JonathanSee Jonathan's Story &gt;Key Finding 2 Low Incomes, Elevated ExpensesPeople with disabilities face several obstacles to making ends meet, from earning enough to get by to higher expenses associated with their conditions.Employment BarriersPeople with disabilities cite a wide variety of barriers to employment.Negative attitudes in workplaces, insufficient workplace accommodations, transportation difficulties, a lack of education and training, and concern about losing benefits were all commonly cited by respondents (Figure 2).Even among those who said their disability was a barrier (62%), more than half also cited another reason, suggesting they do not attribute their difficulties to their condition alone.Income DisparitiesNearly half (45%) of working-age people with disabilities had annual household incomes under $30,000, compared with just 21% of non-disabled people.Only 40% of working-age people with disabilities were employed, but many want to work or work more.40% of those who weren‘t working reported that they would like to be working for pay.23% of those who were working reported that they would like to be working more.Public Benefits BarriersSafety net programs designed to support people with disabilities don't appear to fill the gap left by employment barriers.3, 4Only about a third of working-age people with disabilities were receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), the two federal disability-related cash benefits.Even among people with disabilities who have low incomes and face barriers to work, many don't receive benefits. Only 63% of those who had annual household incomes below $30,000, were not employed, and who reported that their condition was preventing them from working were receiving SSDI or SSI.Interviewees described difficult application and enrollment processes for public benefits.Means testing and asset limit requirements demand that recipients maintain limited savings cushions and assets - leaving recipients vulnerable to financial shocks and without long-term security.5, 6The Cost of a DisabilityIn addition to income challenges, managing a disability can lead to a higher cost of living. Prior research has estimated that households with an adult with a work-limiting disability require 28% more income on average to reach an equivalent standard of living as those without a disability.7""I have to switch out my [hearing aid] batteries like every 3 days, and those packets are $20 just for 8. I probably have spent thousands of dollars [in the past few years] just on hearing aid batteries. You just can't win with all these extra costs, and even if you have the highest [health insurance], they don't cover ear-related things.""- SimoneSee Simone's Story &gt;Key Finding 3 Financial Services Barriers for the Disability CommunityPeople with disabilities also report several unique challenges in accessing and using financial services that help them save, borrow, and prepare for the future.Banking AccessPrior research has demonstrated that people with disabilities are unbanked - lacking a checking or savings account - at higher rates than the non-disabled population.8, 9, 10We find that the gap in unbanked status between people with and without disabilities appears to be related to income differences: while people with disabilities are unbanked at far higher rates than those without disabilities, gaps close after controlling for income.However, people with disabilities are ""underbanked"" (banked, but also using alternative financial services) at higher rates than people without disabilities even after accounting for income differences.Credit health may be a key reason that disabled people are using alternative credit services like payday loans, pawn, title loans, and refund anticipation loans. More than half (55%) of disabled survey respondents who used an alternative credit service said they did so because their ""credit score was too low to get a loan at a bank"" (Figure 3).People with disabilities reported worse credit scores than those without disabilities at all income levels, suggesting they face distinct barriers to affordable credit.Accessibility of ServicesVery few people with disabilities report discrimination or lack of accessibility at financial institutions.However, levels of satisfaction with financial service providers vary from service to service. In our interviews, several participants noted opportunities for better customer service at financial institutions.Limited Opportunities for Long-Term SavingsOne promising solution to burdensome asset limits - the ABLE account - remains rarely used and poorly understood.SSI and Medicaid impose asset limits on their beneficiaries, but ABLE accounts allow eligible disabled individuals to save and invest assets without losing these benefits. In our survey of individuals with disabilities, less than 1% had an ABLE account, and all of them had less than $10,000 in their accounts.In addition to low account ownership, we find a near-universal lack of awareness or knowledge about ABLE accounts among the disability community: 93% of survey respondents said they were unfamiliar with ABLE accounts.""There are times when people just completely overlooked me as a consumer… And it's not only about dignity, it's equality. I really wanna be treated just like you. And if I see a slight difference, like you're not paying attention or… not as engaged with me as a client, it really bothers me.""- MelanieSee Melanie's Story &gt;Conclusion Creating More Supportive, Inclusive EnvironmentsThe challenges faced by people with disabilities are complex, and no single policy change or intervention will ameliorate them all. However, our research points to several opportunities for stakeholders to better meet the financial health needs of people with disabilities and create more supportive, inclusive environments. With disability inherent to the human condition, this is not just an altruistic notion - supporting the financial health of people with disabilities is in everyone's interest.

300,c00699a3-5f08-33a6-925b-0eb4f84df9ef,SHW,2023-08-12,"The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) Looks Interesting, And It's About To Pay A Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sherwin-williams-company-nyse-shw-120512143.html,1691841912,STORY,['SHW'],"[It looks like The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Sherwin-Williams' shares before the 17th of August to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.60 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.42 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Sherwin-Williams has a trailing yield of approximately 0.9% on its current stock price of $273.72. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Sherwin-Williams can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Sherwin-Williams's payout ratio is modest, at just 26% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 36% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Sherwin-Williams, with earnings per share up 7.5% on average over the last five years. The company is retaining more than half of its earnings within the business, and it has been growing earnings at a decent rate. Organisations that reinvest heavily in themselves typically get stronger over time, which can bring attractive benefits such as stronger earnings and dividends.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Sherwin-Williams has delivered an average of 17% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Sherwin-Williams? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Sherwin-Williams is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Sherwin-Williams is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Sherwin-Williams you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

In fact, it’s widely outperformed the S&amp;P 500’s 9% gain over the last three months, gaining 17%. Three stocks from the Zacks Construction Sector – KB Home KBH, Sherwin-Williams SHW, and Comfort Systems USA FIX – could all be considerations for those looking to tap into the relative strength. Let’s take a closer look at each.KB HomeKB Home, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of the largest homebuilders in the United States, operating in 47 markets from coast to coast. The company’s outlook has shifted favorably across all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s growth is forecasted to cool in its current year, with our estimates suggesting a 30% pullback in earnings on 11% lower revenues. Still, growth resumes in FY24, as expectations allude to a 9% recovery in earnings paired with an 8% revenue bump.Robust quarterly results have helped boost shares post-earnings in back-to-back releases, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, the company has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of 20% across its last four quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSherwin-WilliamsSherwin-Williams, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), manufactures paints, coatings, and other related products. The company’s earnings outlook has shifted higher across the board, reflecting the near-term optimism among analysts.The company has consistently displayed a shareholder-friendly nature, boasting a sizable 17% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Shares currently yield 0.89% annually, a few ticks below the Zacks Construction sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, SHW continues to fire on all cylinders; quarterly revenue of $6.2 billion in 2023 Q2 reflected a quarterly record, improving 6% from the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings of $3.29 grew 36% year-over-year, with the company topping off the robust results with a FY23 guidance upgrade.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchComfort Systems USAComfort Systems USA, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a national provider of comprehensive heating, ventilation, and air conditioning installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement services. Like the stocks above, analysts have become bullish on the company’s outlook, with the trend particularly notable for its next quarterly release.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s hard to ignore the company’s growth trajectory, with Zacks estimates suggesting 44% earnings growth in its current year on 21% higher revenues. The growth is slated to continue, as expectations for FY24 allude to year-over-year earnings and revenue growth rates of 15% and 6%, respectively.Shares trade at a 23.2X forward earnings multiple (F1), above the 18.8X five-year median by a fair margin but below highs of 25.5X in 2022. Investors have had little issue forking up the modest premium for shares given the company’s favorable outlook, with FIX shares up more than 50% on a year-to-date basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSomething To WatchWhile Home Depot HD isn’t a part of the Zacks Construction sector, it’s worth mentioning that the home improvement retailer is scheduled to report quarterly results next week on August 15th.HD shares haven’t fared great in 2023, lagging behind the general market and likely reflecting the deceleration in home improvement projects post-pandemic.Analysts have kept their expectations muted for Home Depot’s release, with the $4.46 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate unchanged over the last 60 days and reflecting a 12% pullback in earnings year-over-year.In addition, Home Depot is forecasted to bring in $42.2 billion per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, reflecting a modest pullback of 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.The company posted somewhat mixed results in its latest release. Still, the market reacted highly positively to the print, causing HD shares to embark on a fresh uptrend post-earnings.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Rather than a sharp downward correction, many stocks have corrected in time and built out some sideways action.For investors that like trading momentum breakouts, these sideways consolidations provide perfect setups to measure trades from.With inflation continuing to ease, the US economy growing at an accelerating pace, and the Federal Reserve laying out a path for lower interest rates, many bullish factors are aligning for what could be an extended bull market.Amazon AMZN, Sherwin Williams SHW, and Caterpillar CAT are three premier US stocks that are forming A+ trade setups. Each of these stocks have considerably outperformed the broad market over the last 10 years, enjoy top Zacks Ranks, have momentum at their back, and are building convincing technical chart patterns.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmazon.com Amazon has made a stunning comeback from the bear market of 2022, rallying 65% YTD. And with some very powerful upward revisions to its earnings estimates, AMZN has jumped onto the Zacks #1 Rank.During the last quarterly earnings report Amazon surprised to the upside by 43%, showing just how effective its restructuring has been this last year. Current quarter earnings estimates have been upgraded by 43.6% and are projected to climb 180% YoY to $0.56 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have been revised higher by 38.5% and forecast to grow 204% YoY to $2.16 per share.Additionally, sales are projected to grow over 10% across time frames and EPS are expected to increase by 34% annually over the next 3-5 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReflecting the drastically improving business performance, AMZN stock is setting up a compelling technical chart pattern. Over the last week price action in the stock has formed a tidy bull flag.If Amazon can trade above the $139.50 level, it should initiate a breakout and draw in a rush of buyers sending the stock higher. However, if it loses the $136 level investors should remain cautious as the signal is invalid, and the stock may want to fill the earnings gap below.Story continuesTradingViewImage Source: TradingViewSherwin Williams Currently sitting in the top 2% of the Zacks Industry Rank, Sherwin Williams stock looks primed for another move higher in the coming weeks. Bolstered by a strong economy, and upward trending earnings revisions, I think investors must keep an eye on this classic American stock.Sherwin Williams stock has built out a prototypical cup and handle pattern, with a tight bull flag forming over the last couple of weeks.If SHW price can break out above the $274.50 level, it should begin its next leg higher. Alternatively, if the stock can’t hold the $270 level of support, investors should wait for another opportunity as the setup is invalid.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewSherwin Williams has begun to see steady earnings estimate upgrades, as analysts have unanimously agreed on upward revisions. Because of this earnings revision trend, SHW has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 8.7% to $2.75 per share, while FY23 estimates have been revised higher by nearly 10% to $9.56 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar Caterpillar stock gapped up to new all-time highs last week, following a huge earnings beat. Since the report the stock has held the gap and formed a neat bull flag consolidation to trade from.If CAT stock can breakout above the $288.50 level, a rush of buying should propel the stock to another new all-time high. But, if the price loses the support of the $278 level, it could fill that earnings gap, so investors should be caution below there.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewThe incredibly strong construction market has been a major boon for Caterpillars stock sending sales and earnings estimates much higher and giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 10% and are forecast to grow 14% YoY to $4.50 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have been revised higher by 8.4% and are expected to climb 39% YoY to $19.25.Additionally, current quarter sales are projected to grow 8% YoY to $16.2 billion and FY23 sales are set to increase 11.6% YoY to $66.3 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineHere I have shared some very clean trade setups, however investors should always keep risk management top of mind.

303,855a5137-5c64-33f4-a0f2-e8869496db01,FCX,2023-08-12,Investors in Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) have seen stellar returns of 211% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-freeport-mcmoran-nyse-fcx-120712099.html,1691842032,STORY,['FCX'],"[It might seem bad, but the worst that can happen when you buy a stock (without leverage) is that its share price goes to zero. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. To wit, the Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) share price has flown 201% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! Also pleasing for shareholders was the 18% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 8.9% in the last three months.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Freeport-McMoRan moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, it has a TSR of 211% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Freeport-McMoRan shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 33% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 26% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Freeport-McMoRan better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Freeport-McMoRan that you should be aware of before investing here.Freeport-McMoRan is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Among these, Sage Therapeutics SAGE was in the spotlight as it suffered a regulatory setback.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:SAGE Crashes on Setback:  Shares of Sage Therapeutics plunged earlier in the week after the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for its new drug application (NDA) for zuranolone to treat adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). The drug is being developed in collaboration with Biogen. The FDA stated that the application did not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness to support the approval of zuranolone, and hence, an additional study or studies will be needed. Sage and Biogen are evaluating the further course of action.The agency, however, approved zuranolone for adults with postpartum depression (PPD) under the brand name Zurzuvae. Per the companies, Zurzuvae is the first and only oral, once-daily, 14-day treatment that can rapidly improve depressive symptoms in women with PPD. This approval was based on the NEST clinical development program, which included two studies in adult women with PPD (ROBIN and SKYLARK Studies). Both studies met their primary endpoint, a significant mean reduction from baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) total score, a common measure of depression severity, at Day 15 compared to placebo.While the approval of the drug for PDD is positive, MDD is a much larger and more lucrative market opportunity. Investors clearly were disappointed with the setback, leading to the massive crash in Sage’s share price.Regeneron to Acquire Decibel:  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. REGN announced that it would acquire clinical-stage biotechnology company Decibel Therapeutics, Inc. DBTX for $213 million to expand its gene therapy programs for hearing loss.Per the terms, Regeneron will acquire Decibel's common stock for $4.00 per share, payable in cash at closing. The deal will also give Decibel shareholders an additional non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR) to receive up to $3.50 per share in cash upon achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones for Decibel’s lead investigational candidate, DB-OTO, within specified periods. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.Story continuesShares of Decibel surged 80.29% on Aug 9 following the acquisition news, as a merger with a bigwig like Regeneron will accelerate the development of candidates with a much-needed cash infusion and expertise. Both companies initially collaborated in 2017 to discover and develop new potential therapeutics to protect, repair and restore hearing. Thereafter, in 2021, Regeneron extended the research term of its collaboration with Decibel to discover and develop gene therapies for hearing loss to Nov 15, 2023.Decibel’s pipeline includes DB-OTO, which is currently in the global phase I/II CHORD study. It is an investigational cell-selective, adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy designed to provide durable, physiological hearing to individuals with profound, congenital hearing loss caused by mutations of the otoferlin gene. Preclinical programs include AAV.103 for people with GJB2-related hearing loss and AAV.104 for people with stereocilin-related hearing loss.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Galera Plunges on Regulatory Update:  Shares of Galera Therapeutics, Inc. GRTX plummeted on receipt of a CRL from the FDA regarding the company’s NDA for avasopasem manganese (avasopasem) for radiotherapy-induced severe oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing standard-of-care treatment.  The FDA stated the results from the late-stage ROMAN trial, along with the supporting data from the GT-201 trial, are not sufficiently persuasive to establish substantial evidence of avasopasem’s effectiveness and safety for reducing severe oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer in the CRL. Consequently, the regulatory body asked for results from an additional clinical trial for resubmission.Galera intends to request a type A meeting with the FDA to understand the agency’s rationale for its decision and discuss the next steps to support an NDA resubmission seeking approval of avasopasem. It is also looking for partnerships for the continued development of avasopasem and rucosopasem.Galera also announced that it will reduce its workforce by approximately 70%. The restructuring plan includes a wind-down of launch activities and headcount reductions across several departments.Vistagen Surges on Study Success: Shares of clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, Vistagen VTGN, surged after the company announced that its late-stage study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of fasedienol (PH94B) nasal spray in adults diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD) was successful. The phase III study, PALISADE-2, met its primary endpoint, with fasedienol demonstrating a statistically significant difference in average SUDS score during a public speaking challenge compared to placebo. The trial also met its secondary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant difference in the proportion of clinician-assessed responders between fasedienol and placebo as measured by the CGI-I scale. The candidate was well-tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile consistent with all prior trials.Consequently, Vistagen is planning an additional phase III study involving multiple administrations of fasedienol over several weeks on a patient-tailored basis. The success of the PALISADE-2 increases the probability of a plausible FDA approval of the candidate, which will be a significant boost for Vistagen.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has lost 1.08% in the past five trading sessions. Among the biotech giants, Amgen has gained 13.59% during the period. Over the past six months, shares of Moderna have lost 40.76%.

DDS posted second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This marked the company’s 10th straight quarter of a top and bottom-line beat. Results gained from better inventory management and strong consumer demand.Adjusted earnings of $7.98 per share significantly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.21. However, the bottom line declined 14.2% from the year-ago quarter's $9.30 per share.Total revenues of $1,567.4 million decreased 1.3% from the prior-year quarter but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,534 million.Dillard’s shares rallied 10% yesterday, driven by the robust second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance. Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 30.3% in the past three months compared with the industry's growth of 17.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Total retail sales (excluding CDI Contractors, LLC) fell 3% year over year to $1,499 million. Comparable store sales also declined 3% year over year. Retail sales were affected by the continued cautiousness of consumers in the first few weeks of the fiscal second quarter.Our model has predicted comps decline of 5.7% for the fiscal second quarter. The improved performance compared to our estimate can be attributed to the fading of the cautious consumer shopping behavior in the latter part of the quarter.In the quarter, the company witnessed robust sales in cosmetics, and home and furniture categories. On the flip side, ladies’ accessories and lingerie, and ladies’ apparel and shoes were among the underperforming categories.Dillard's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Dillard's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDillard's, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Dillard's, Inc.

Each blog highlights a different Cisco employee whose work positively impacts people, communities, or the planet. The series was formerly known as people behind Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at Cisco.July 30 is World Day Against Trafficking in Persons. Globally, an estimated 24.9 million people are subjected to human trafficking, which generates an estimated $150 billion annually in illicit profits, per the 2021 National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking White House report. According to UNICEF, more than 1.2 million children are trafficked across international borders each year. More than 17,000 people are trafficked into the United States each year. Many are children. These are very sobering statistics that only continue to grow each year.The Foundation for a Slavery Free World (SFW) is one organization that has partnered with Cisco through Cisco's Community Impact to end human trafficking by public outreach via education and events, supporting law enforcement's efforts to rescue victims, and collaborating with the IT industry to develop new technologies. Cisconian Scarlet Estrada, CX enablement program manager, shares about her involvement with SFW and how all Cisconians can be an advocate for this important topic.Tell us a little about yourself and what brought you to Cisco?Scarlet: I was born in Venezuela and began my career with Chevron, working several different analyst positions in both Venezuela and California for a little over ten years.I then moved to Canada to start a new life with my young family, starting with Boston Pizza as a community relations coordinator, which allowed me to start a new professional network and afforded me the flexibility to raise my young children at the time.Story continuesI also held positions as a quality engineering assistant, communications coordinator, and client services account coordinator for different companies.Through the years, I kept in touch with many colleagues in the corporate world. A friend who was at Cisco reached out to me in 2018 to let me know about a renewals manager position within Cisco's Customer Experience (CX) organization, stating that my background in account coordination, customer experience and marketing would be beneficial to the team. I interviewed, got the job, and began my Cisco career in November 2018.What is your current role at Cisco, and how do you incorporate Purpose into your everyday work?Scarlet: I am part of CX IB Methodology core program team responsible for consultants' enablement as well as program development. We partner with renewals teams to make recommendations for services and software renewals, simplifying the renewals landscape and aligning on sales motions to help Cisco optimize customer solutions. My passion is to translate complexity into a simple customer's lens. I have always sought out roles where my primary purpose is to serve and I am always looking for a better, simpler way to do things. People often come to me when they want someone to explain why things are playing out a certain way and to pick up on the hidden complexities of a situation. Every day I strive to make a difference and drive impactful results for our CX organization and Cisco. Working at Cisco offers great flexibility, interacting with people worldwide daily. For me, on top of this, I love to use my Time 2 Give hours (T2G) to help with the migrant community and their issues.How did you first become involved in the Foundation for a Slavery Free World?Scarlet: I first learned about the Foundation for a Slavery Free World through my daughter in late 2021. She is an actor and had a role on a movie with fellow actor Marisol Nichols, who is the founder and executive director of the foundation.In between movie takes, I had the opportunity to learn about Marisol's work as an undercover agent to take down traffickers and she shared about an operation where several women from Venezuela were rescued in the Caribbean. Learning about this, and how it affects people from my home country, motivated me to help find a way to get involved with Slavery Free World.Marisol has been a part of numerous undercover stings leading to the successful arrest of dozens of traffickers and child predators, as well as liberating numerous women and children. And her passion, education, and advocacy for this important and global crisis moved me to help secure a grant through Bright Funds to support SFW's work.Why is volunteering with Slavery Free World important to you?Scarlet: As a mom, you are concerned for your children's wellbeing, especially in this digital age where it is very easy for online predators and bad actors to get to vulnerable children. They're a lot more exposed to the world out there than any previous generations.The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's (NCMEC) data shows a 35% increase year over year in online child sexual exploitation reports. Sadly, it happens in Canada as predators can reach children online anywhere in the world. I have had to protect my children personally from suspicious people and groomers trying to connect with them online.Also, the connection to my birthplace Venezuela and the exposure risks and vulnerabilities of women and children as they try to migrate to other countries for better opportunities is especially close to me. Any opportunity I have to help make a positive difference to prevent trafficking from occurring is important to me.What inroads has Slavery Free World made to combat trafficking?Scarlet: Slavery Free World (SFW) has reached millions through the website, Marisol's podcast, and on its social media platforms.It has multiplied its podcast subscribers and reached 10's of millions from its education campaigns. Marisol has also been invited to speak at the prestigious Yahoo Makers conference on her work in anti-trafficking, appeared on numerous talk shows, including Access Hollywood, KTLA, and Today Extra.As well as speaking at numerous government events such as the AG's Alliance, meeting with law enforcement, and continuing legal education events on human trafficking to discuss how to prevent it, SFW and Marisol are also passionate about educating parents and children on dangers of child traffickers online.SFW is also meeting with social media platforms about the ways technology can be part of the solution to save women and children from this increasing crime, and in educating and spreading awareness about this most serious issue.Marisol herself through her undercover work with her foundation has personally assisted in the rescue of numerous women and children and brought dozens of pedophiles and traffickers to justice.The Marisol Nichols podcast is a true crime show where she talks about her undercover work to bring child predators and traffickers to justice in partnership with key organizations. The second season of her podcast, which will be released soon, includes an episode with Meta on the technology side of this issue.What are some ways people can get involved in helping with Slavery Free World?Scarlet: There are several ways anyone can get involved with helping Slavery Free World spread awareness and advocacy.Check out the SFW website and educate yourself.Sign up for and share Marisol's podcast with your social networks.Donate to https://cisco.benevity.org/en-ca/campaigns/609Invite Marisol to come speak at an upcoming organization event.Educate your children and community on the dangers and warning signs of trafficking through SFW's numerous resources.If you notice something dangerous online or in your community that could be related to trafficking, contact your local law enforcement right away. In the United States, you can also reach out to National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children - 24-Hour Hotline - 1-800-843-5678 and the National Human Trafficking Hotline - Call 1-888-373-7888 ( TTY: 711) | *Text 233733.""This is a dark subject and good people don't usually know about it. But for anything to be done to fix this, we need good people be aware of it. So that real change can occur, and children can be free.""​​​ ​​​​​​​​​- Marisol NicholsPlease also check out this podcast episode on the rescuing of Venezuelan women and children.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/773775/People-Behind-Purpose-at-Cisco-During-World-Day-Against-Trafficking-in-Persons-Everyone-Can-Be-an-Advocate]"
