If so, you wouldn't be the first. You may already be using AI to allocate your retirement savings without knowing it."", ""These tools are obviously powerful by virtue of being able to access much of the world's collective knowledge. A handful of brokerages and investment managers know this and have been providing such technology for some time now. They just don't tell clients that their stock picks are being powered by artificial intelligence because ... well, because the world's still not completely convinced that generalized AI-powered chat tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Gemini always get things right."", ""That's because the AI doesn't always get things right, by the way. Indeed, when it comes to retirement planning, all-encompassing platforms like the aforementioned Copilot or ChatGPT can sometimes be alarmingly problematic by missing key details about your specific situation."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's why you're better served by sticking with the AI tools built specifically to help you manage your retirement investments."", ""If you're a customer of brokerage firm Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW), then you've already been exposed to an AI-powered stock-picking tool. Unveiled in early 2022, this technology allows investors to narrow their investment choices down to a manageable handful based on the usual criteria like risk, growth, and valuation. But the tool also helps investors identify and capitalize on qualitative trends or themes."", ""It's not exactly a new idea. Investors have had access to theme-based stock suggestions for years now. Usually, it just seems like another criterion offered by a stock screener."", 'There\'s far more artificial intelligence being applied here than there seems to be on the surface. Much like Microsoft\'s Copilot and Google\'s Gemini, Schwab\'s tool uses AI ""to find companies linked to those keywords and phrases, combing through millions of public documents, such as patents, clinical trials, and company filings."" It very likely comes up with picks most investors would have otherwise never come across.', ""Perhaps more relevant to future or current retirees is Schwab's menu of so-called Intelligent Portfolios, which build and then update a portfolio pre-selected for your particular situation. What the company refers to as a robo-advisor doing this portfolio maintenance is actually a form of automated AI. Although these portfolios certainly don't outperform the broad market each and every quarter, they do offer less volatile, more consistent performances without requiring constant monitoring and management by investors."", ""Mutual fund giant Fidelity also has its own robo-advisor tech, powering an automated investment service called Fidelity Go. Although it's not Fidelity's invention, the brokerage firm offers its customers access to Capitalize.ai, allowing users to turn the simplest of word-based instructions into a trading algorithm."", 'Investment management outfit BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) -- the name behind the iShares family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) -- is another financial services name waist-deep in AI waters.', 'While most of the company\'s interest in AI has been to empower financial advisors via a revenue-bearing platform called Aladdin, it\'s not unaware of the potential of AI as a stock-picking tool. For instance, commenting specifically on retirement portfolios, BlackRock explains that ""by analyzing vast datasets, including satellite imagery and labor mobility data, AI can extract early insights on economic activities across regions, which can be used to inform macro (e.g., regional) and micro (e.g., company level) tilts in our portfolios.""', ""To this end, while it doesn't offer a Schwab-like robo-advisor to individual investors, BlackRock has never denied the fact that it's using AI to help guide its fund managers' investment choices. So, in a sense, some individual investors are directly benefiting from BlackRock's AI tech."", ""Some might argue that general-purpose AI chat platforms like ChatGPT and Gemini have come a long way since Schwab and Fidelity first launched their AI-powered stock-picking tools. Namely, they've become incredibly user-friendly."", ""And that's not incorrect."", ""But all-purpose AI platforms still aren't great self-service options for allocating your retirement savings even when you can convince a general AI assistant to help you do so. These platforms are seemingly aware that even they are not ideally suited to offer you a full-blown portfolio plan; as such, they don't always provide more than a broad allocation theory."", ""Not all AI is the same. Microsoft's Copilot and OpenAi's ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini are all large language model (or LLM) AI, meaning they rely on the collective wisdom created by the text available on billions and billions of web pages. By interpreting and integrating as much credible information available on the web as they can, these platforms can end up ignoring a nuance that might be uniquely important to you."", ""It's also worth adding that while LLMs can analyze numerical data, they're not built to deal with numbers. They often struggle when it comes to doing predictive numerical analysis. This, of course, is the kind of math retirees typically need done (and need done right)."", 'The missing element? Context. Gemini or Copilot ""understand"" words largely based on the words appearing before or after them. With numbers though, these tools don\'t always understand what it is you\'re trying to accomplish or determine, or how to do it, particularly when you\'re giving these AI platforms instructions using words.', ""That's not the case with the portfolio-allocation tools offered by Schwab or Fidelity, or perhaps eventually by BlackRock. Their technology is built from the ground up to handle numbers and meet needs specific to investors. They may require more input from you on the front end, but they're far better suited to provide you with the solutions you need in the end."", ""These investor-oriented AI tools also do something important that most general AI-powered chatbots don't; they ask you questions that force you to think about what it is you ultimately want to accomplish. ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot don't ask any follow-up, clarifying questions. In fact, these tools don't even recognize that they should be asking more probing questions of investors using them."", ""Connect the dots. The additional information and investment of your time in the creation of a customized retirement portfolio will very likely lead to superior returns (relative to the risk you're taking) from your retirement fund. So, stick with the tools purpose-built to allocate a portfolio specifically for you. It's worth it even if they're not the easiest and most accessible option to use."", 'Before you buy stock in Charles Schwab, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Charles Schwab wasn’t one of them.

Buy This ETF Instead,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ebddb824-776a-3836-ae8a-57a83c26b487/you-can-do-better-than-the.html,1716105000,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'SCHW']","[""Investing isn't a one-size-fits-all situation, which is why there are so many different investment approaches you can follow. And yet the common reference point for most investors is the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index. Here's one big problem for a retired investor in need of income who just defaults to the S&P 500: The index's dividend yield is a scant 1.3% today. It would be hard for a dividend investor to live off of that, which is why a better option would be Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD), which has a yield of nearly 3.5%."", ""As far as indexes go, the S&P 500 Index is fairly well constructed. For starters, it owns a large number of stocks, providing diversification. The stocks are selected based on their size and importance to the U.S. economy, so they are notable companies, not obscure businesses. The stocks in the index are weighted based on market cap, so the largest stocks have the most influence on the index's performance. That's pretty representative of the real world, and it ensures that anyone who owns the index is putting more money into the best-performing stocks (which are usually, though not always, the largest ones)."", ""But just because an index is well constructed doesn't mean it is the right index for every investor to own. As noted, the yield on the S&P 500 Index is a slim 1.3%. That's a very small number, and it would require a huge investment to generate a meaningful level of dividend income if you just owned an S&P 500-tracking exchange-traded fund (ETF) like SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY). A better bet would be to buy an ETF that is focused on generating dividend income. A good option is Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, which offers a yield that's nearly three times the size of what you'd collect from an S&P 500 tracking ETF."", ""Before you buy Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, or any ETF for that matter, you need to dig into the investment methodology. In this case, the ETF is trying to create a balance between quality and dividend yield. That's notably different from an ETF like SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYD), which simply buys the 80 highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500 index."", 'To get its final list of about 100 stocks, Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF first removes real estate investment trusts (REITs). It then screens for companies that have increased their dividends annually for 10 consecutive years. This is the base list of investment candidates. For each of these potential investments, it creates a composite score using cash-flow-to-total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and the five-year dividend-growth rate. The scores for each company are ranked from best to worst, and the top 100 are the ones that get into Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF.', ""The end result isn't an income-focused ETF, per se, but an ETF that tries to ensure that investors own good companies with growing businesses and attractive yields. All in all, based on the investment approach, Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF sounds like it would be a pretty good option for most dividend investors who want a simple way to invest in dividend stocks. Pair that with a broad-based bond fund, perhaps like Vanguard Total Bond Market Index ETF (NASDAQ: BND), and you have a fairly solid foundation for a balanced portfolio. Notably, Vanguard Total Bond Market Index ETF has a yield that's a bit over 3.3%. You could probably do better than that if you were willing to take on more fixed-income risk."", ""The S&P 500 index is great, but it isn't the right investment option for every investor. For example, the S&P's goal is just to represent the broader economy, which is not going to serve dividend investors very well. If you are looking for income, an ETF like Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF will probably be a better choice. It is specifically designed to meet the needs of dividend investors looking to own high-quality growing businesses that pay attractive dividends."", 'Before you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn’t one of them.

Industry experts said the company is mired in an unpleasant mix of problems, which include an identity crisis, several management controversies, ignoring evolving market trends to its detriment, and a rotating carousel of CEOs in quick succession.', 'One of them is Kevin Plank, its founder, who is back at the helm for a second time as CEO after being replaced in 2019. Similar to Starbucks founder Howard Schultz’s past returns to Starbucks and Disney chief Bob Iger’s recent return as CEO, Plank aims to right the ship at Under Armour.', '“When Under Armour was growing at 20% plus numbers, people saw it as a legitimate competitor to Nike,” said David Swartz, senior equity analyst with research firm Morningstar, in an interview with CNN.', '“It was like On or Hoka but 10 years ago. It was the upstart athletic brand that was making real inroads against Nike, the dominant name in the industry. People saw it as a company that actually could break through and take market share from Nike among the hardcore athletes,” Swartz said. “That actually did happen for a while, but then that didn’t last.”', 'Plank launched Under Armour in 1996 to be what the name suggests — a protective layer of clothing worn by competitive athletes sweating it out in the heat of the game.', 'The first product was a fitted T-shirt called “The Shorty,” made from moisture-wicking fabric for elite athletes to wear under their uniforms to keep them dry. Its iconic Under Armour intertwined “U” and “A” logo was strategically placed on the neckline, to keep it conspicuous.', 'The T-shirt eventually launched the brand to the masses after it quickly gained fandom among the ranks of professional athletes. The startup’s fast track to success led to Under Armour going public in 2005. It’s early slogan: “Protect This House.”', 'By 2010, the business had crossed $1 billion in sales. Five years later, sales surpassed $4 billion. But then the momentum started to wane.', 'The past eight years for Under Armour have been a struggle that doesn’t appear to be abating.', 'The company on Thursday announced a restructuring of its business as its North America sales in its most recent quarter tumbled 10%. Looking ahead, the company cast a dour forecast for its current fiscal year, expecting sales to drop 15% to 17%. Layoffs will be part of the effort to right the ship but executives did not specify how many employees will lose their jobs.', 'Under Armour also announced a $500 million share buyback, a move to reward shareholders.', 'Plank told analysts during the earnings call on Thursday that he will shepherd a reset of the business that centers on selling fewer but more innovative products to meet the needs of athletes, significantly accelerating product development, refocusing on its men’s apparel category and reducing discounts of its products.', '“We are simply doing too much stuff. There are too many products, too many initiatives. To reconstitute this brand, we must be highly focused and prioritize what needs to get done so that our teams know exactly what to do with a clear definition of success for them,” Plank said.', 'It can’t be ignored that management issues, too, have plagued the business for years, Swartz said.', '“The company has essentially had five CEOs in the past five years, if you count Kevin Plank twice,” said Swartz. Plank was announced as CEO — again — in March, ending the very brief year-long tenure of Stephanie Linnartz.', 'Plank conceded during the analysts call Thursday that frequent C-suite turnover had become a serious impediment to success.', '“With several CEOs and heads of product, marketing in North America over the past half-decade, ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive,” he said.', 'The period from 2016 onward is when “things really started to fall apart” at Under Armour, Swartz said. A huge issue arose when an important channel of distribution for the brand went bankrupt and closed stores.', 'A bulk of Under Armour products are sold through sporting goods retailers and department stores, including Macy’s and Kohl’s, and online.', '“When Sports Authority went bankrupt in 2016 it really hurt Under Armour. It was a major customer of the brand, as is Dick’s Sporting Goods,” Schwartz said.', 'In 2020, UCLA sued Under Armour for ending a $280 million sponsorship deal. The suit alleged that Under Armour was struggling before Covid-19 and that it used the pandemic as a reason to get out of the deal.', 'The 15-year sponsorship deal, signed in 2016, was the largest in the history of college sports at the time. In exchange for the $280 million, UCLA’s student athletes and personnel would wear and use Under Armour (UA)-supplied products exclusively. The company reached a settlement with UCLA.', 'The following year, Under Armour paid $9 million to settle a multi-year investigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commission into its past accounting practices, according to Footwear News.', 'Outside of other bad press for Plank, competitors were gaining ground on Under Armour, whose high-performance sportwear offerings weren’t best suited for the Lululemon-driven athleisure trend that had emerged and then dominated the way consumers dressed through the pandemic.', '“Under Armour has failed to latch upon streetwear, or sports style that catapulted On or Hoka or Merrell,” said Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce, with market research firm eMarketer, in an interview with CNN. “It needs to figure out what is next. If it can’t do that, then it needs to quickly latch upon what another brand has identified as the next big thing.”', 'Stambor questioned Plank’s decision to pull back from discounts at a time when consumers are hyper focused on value.', '“It carries the risk of decreasing demand particularly when you don’t have a must-have product,” he said. Stambor said this decision also stands in stark contrast to a recent move that rival Adidas has made to roll out cheaper versions of their must-have shoes.', 'Despite it’s significant challenges, Stambor said Under Armour can remain relevant in the market. “It is a very large company with huge revenue. It’s not as though the brand has fully diminished in standing. It’s a bit stuck,” he said.', '“Under Armour needs to identify what it is that consumers want and lean heavily in that direction. It hasn’t fully shown an ability to do so over the past few years,” he said.', 'One area that’s going strong is the brand’s long-term celebrity-brand partnerships, said Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group, a sports and entertainment firm that evaluates sponsorships and advertising campaigns.', '“Under Armour’s relationship with the ‘The Rock’, Dwayne Johnson, has been pretty effective. They’ve expanded to the United Football League, which is the football league that Johnson co-owns,” Smallwood said. “Their uniforms are Under Armour.”', 'Golf is another area where the brand is making inroads while the Stephen Curry partnership has kept the brand visible in the basketball world, Smallwood said.', 'The basketball superstar Curry, arguably the best shooter in history, famously signed with Under Armour instead of Nike in 2013. Meanwhile, the brand’s other major NBA star, Joel Embiid, quit Under Armour in 2023 a few months after he was named the league’s most valuable player.', 'Embiid signed a shoe deal with Skechers last month. Under Armour reportedly bid hard for a shoe deal with WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark, who many expect will sign with Nike.', '“The bottomline for Under Armour is for the brand to be clear about its identity,” he said. “Are they a shoe company? Are they an apparel company? At one point everyone else copied their mositure-wicking undershirt. Then maybe they had an identity crisis. It’s going to come down to deciding if they want to evolve into a lifestyle brand or stay in performance-based products.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

However, behind the glitz and glamor, the industry has been grappling with several inherent weaknesses. Those have left the sector particularly vulnerable to economic downturns and unforeseen crises. These susceptibilities have been brought to the forefront in recent years, causing investors to question the long-term viability of these cruise stocks to avoid.', 'One of the most significant weaknesses of the cruise industry is its heavy reliance on discretionary spending. Unlike essential goods and services, cruises are often seen as a luxury. Some consumers easily forego such treats during times of financial uncertainty, such as a stock market crash.

This follows a notable debt reduction in 2023, when RCL paid off approximately $4 billion, aiming to reach investment grade metrics.', 'For 2024, RCL has scheduled significant capital expenditures totaling around $3.3 billion. This price tag was primarily for its new ship orders, including the Utopia of the Seas and Silver Ray. Also, the company anticipates a capacity increase of 8.5% compared to 2023.Despite its positive outlook, its current and quick ratios stand at 0.19 and 0.09, making it a highly leveraged company.

And, OSW could be substantially impacted if a stock market crash comes materializes.', 'Still, OSW has raised its revenue guidance for 2024 to $860 to $880 million, reflecting a positive start to the year. The company reported a significant improvement in Q1 of 2024. Revenues increased to $211.2 million, a 16% rise from the previous year. Also, net income reached $21.2 million, turning around from a loss of $15.9 million year-over-year (YOY).', 'But, the situation becomes dicey because OSW’s valuation is essentially hinged on the assumption of no broader markets’ correction and its continued incredible earnings growth run.', 'Yet, OSW trades at 55 times earnings, and its forward P/E is 18 times earnings. So although times are certainly good for OSW, its high P/E makes its stock price vulnerable to being sold off. This is specially true if the broader macro backdrop deteriorates in the face of higher for longer interest rates and stubborn inflation.', 'Source: Nazar Skladanyi / Shutterstock', 'Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH) is another major player facing similar challenges. Despite some positive earnings, the overall volatility in the cruise sector and potential regulatory changes post-pandemic add a layer of investment risk in addition to the market risks it faces.', 'Additionally, NCLH is significantly leveraged, but to a lesser degree than RCL. Its liquidity ratios for its current and quick measures are 0.24 and 0.13, respectively.

You may already be using AI to allocate your retirement savings without knowing it."", ""These tools are obviously powerful by virtue of being able to access much of the world's collective knowledge. A handful of brokerages and investment managers know this and have been providing such technology for some time now. They just don't tell clients that their stock picks are being powered by artificial intelligence because ... well, because the world's still not completely convinced that generalized AI-powered chat tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Gemini always get things right."", ""That's because the AI doesn't always get things right, by the way. Indeed, when it comes to retirement planning, all-encompassing platforms like the aforementioned Copilot or ChatGPT can sometimes be alarmingly problematic by missing key details about your specific situation."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's why you're better served by sticking with the AI tools built specifically to help you manage your retirement investments."", ""If you're a customer of brokerage firm Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW), then you've already been exposed to an AI-powered stock-picking tool. Unveiled in early 2022, this technology allows investors to narrow their investment choices down to a manageable handful based on the usual criteria like risk, growth, and valuation. But the tool also helps investors identify and capitalize on qualitative trends or themes."", ""It's not exactly a new idea. Investors have had access to theme-based stock suggestions for years now. Usually, it just seems like another criterion offered by a stock screener."", 'There\'s far more artificial intelligence being applied here than there seems to be on the surface. Much like Microsoft\'s Copilot and Google\'s Gemini, Schwab\'s tool uses AI ""to find companies linked to those keywords and phrases, combing through millions of public documents, such as patents, clinical trials, and company filings."" It very likely comes up with picks most investors would have otherwise never come across.', ""Perhaps more relevant to future or current retirees is Schwab's menu of so-called Intelligent Portfolios, which build and then update a portfolio pre-selected for your particular situation. What the company refers to as a robo-advisor doing this portfolio maintenance is actually a form of automated AI. Although these portfolios certainly don't outperform the broad market each and every quarter, they do offer less volatile, more consistent performances without requiring constant monitoring and management by investors."", ""Mutual fund giant Fidelity also has its own robo-advisor tech, powering an automated investment service called Fidelity Go. Although it's not Fidelity's invention, the brokerage firm offers its customers access to Capitalize.ai, allowing users to turn the simplest of word-based instructions into a trading algorithm."", 'Investment management outfit BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) -- the name behind the iShares family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) -- is another financial services name waist-deep in AI waters.', 'While most of the company\'s interest in AI has been to empower financial advisors via a revenue-bearing platform called Aladdin, it\'s not unaware of the potential of AI as a stock-picking tool. For instance, commenting specifically on retirement portfolios, BlackRock explains that ""by analyzing vast datasets, including satellite imagery and labor mobility data, AI can extract early insights on economic activities across regions, which can be used to inform macro (e.g., regional) and micro (e.g., company level) tilts in our portfolios.""', ""To this end, while it doesn't offer a Schwab-like robo-advisor to individual investors, BlackRock has never denied the fact that it's using AI to help guide its fund managers' investment choices. So, in a sense, some individual investors are directly benefiting from BlackRock's AI tech."", ""Some might argue that general-purpose AI chat platforms like ChatGPT and Gemini have come a long way since Schwab and Fidelity first launched their AI-powered stock-picking tools. Namely, they've become incredibly user-friendly."", ""And that's not incorrect."", ""But all-purpose AI platforms still aren't great self-service options for allocating your retirement savings even when you can convince a general AI assistant to help you do so. These platforms are seemingly aware that even they are not ideally suited to offer you a full-blown portfolio plan; as such, they don't always provide more than a broad allocation theory."", ""Not all AI is the same. Microsoft's Copilot and OpenAi's ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini are all large language model (or LLM) AI, meaning they rely on the collective wisdom created by the text available on billions and billions of web pages. By interpreting and integrating as much credible information available on the web as they can, these platforms can end up ignoring a nuance that might be uniquely important to you."", ""It's also worth adding that while LLMs can analyze numerical data, they're not built to deal with numbers. They often struggle when it comes to doing predictive numerical analysis. This, of course, is the kind of math retirees typically need done (and need done right)."", 'The missing element? Context. Gemini or Copilot ""understand"" words largely based on the words appearing before or after them. With numbers though, these tools don\'t always understand what it is you\'re trying to accomplish or determine, or how to do it, particularly when you\'re giving these AI platforms instructions using words.', ""That's not the case with the portfolio-allocation tools offered by Schwab or Fidelity, or perhaps eventually by BlackRock. Their technology is built from the ground up to handle numbers and meet needs specific to investors. They may require more input from you on the front end, but they're far better suited to provide you with the solutions you need in the end."", ""These investor-oriented AI tools also do something important that most general AI-powered chatbots don't; they ask you questions that force you to think about what it is you ultimately want to accomplish. ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot don't ask any follow-up, clarifying questions. In fact, these tools don't even recognize that they should be asking more probing questions of investors using them."", ""Connect the dots. The additional information and investment of your time in the creation of a customized retirement portfolio will very likely lead to superior returns (relative to the risk you're taking) from your retirement fund. So, stick with the tools purpose-built to allocate a portfolio specifically for you. It's worth it even if they're not the easiest and most accessible option to use."", 'Before you buy stock in Charles Schwab, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Charles Schwab wasn’t one of them.

Since early last year, the adoption of AI has spread like wildfire, fueled by Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). The company will face a key hurdle when it reports its first-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, and Wall Street will be sitting on the edge of its seat to parse the results."", 'The stock has gained an incredible 548% since the start of last year (as of this writing), fueled by strong and accelerating demand for AI. Nvidia has been the unofficial standard bearer of the AI revolution, but investors are beginning to wonder if the trend can continue at its recent breakneck pace.', ""With the scene set, should investors buy Nvidia stock before its highly anticipated first-quarter report? Let's examine the available evidence."", 'The initial excitement has worn off in recent months and investors are no longer taking the AI revolution on faith. Yet, the major cloud services have been vocal about the ongoing demand for generative AI and their plans to boost investment in the space.', 'Microsoft increased its capital expenditures by 79% to $14 billion in the calendar first quarter, while Alphabet\'s spending grew by 90% to $12 billion. Amazon spent $14 billion in the first quarter, which it expects will be the low point of spending for the year, expecting capex spending to ""meaningfully increase"" thanks to AI.', ""Since data centers and cloud infrastructure providers are among Nvidia's largest customers, that would seem to bode well for the company's upcoming report."", ""For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30), analysts expect Nvidia's sales to surge 277% to $24.6 billion, with earnings per share (EPS) jumping from $0.83 to $4.57."", 'While results of that magnitude might seem unlikely, consider this: in the fourth quarter, Nvidia generated record revenue that jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, and its outlook is calling for Q1 revenue of $24 billion -- and its guidance tends to be conservative.', ""Several AI-centric companies have reported results in recent weeks, and the market's reaction has been puzzling, to say the least."", 'Earlier this month, AI software and data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) reported first-quarter revenue that grew 21% year over year and 4% sequentially to $634 million, while its adjusted EPS jumped 60%. Wall Street found its guidance lacking, however, and the stock fell 15% on the day following its report.', 'For its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended March 31), chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) reported revenue that grew 47% year over year to $928 million, while adjusted EPS of $0.36 soared 1,700% (not a typo). Despite the surge in both sales and profits, investors were hoping for more robust guidance, and the stock fell 2% following the release of its results.', 'For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), AI-centric server maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) delivered record revenue that jumped 200% year over year to $3.85 billion, while adjusted EPS soared 308% to $6.65. Despite raising its guidance, Wall Street wanted more, and the stock tumbled 14% on the day following its report.', 'Eagle-eyed investors will have noticed a pattern emerging. Despite strong, expectation-beating results, Wall Street is looking to the future and taking a wait-and-see approach.', 'These results suggest that while demand for AI remains high, investors are not only demanding stellar results but looking for robust guidance to confirm that the secular tailwinds of AI continue to blow.', 'How you answer this question depends on what type of investor you are. For those looking to buy ownership in a business with a strong track record of execution, savvy management, and technological tailwinds, and have plans to hold it for the long term, then Nvidia might just be the stock for you.', ""If, however, you're looking to jump into the stock before earnings in the hopes that it will pop so you can make a quick exit, then Nvidia might end up being a disappointment. Truth be told, there's simply no way to know for sure whether Nvidia stock will go up or down after it reports on Wednesday."", ""If I were to hazard a guess, I'm inclined to think that investors continue to underestimate the continuing strong deman for AI and the fundamental changes it will bring to the fore. That said, unless Nvidia significantly boosts its guidance, the stock could tumble."", ""That said, Nvidia has shown a knack for skating to where the puck is going rather than where it's been. The company continues to spend heavily on research and development, which amounted to 20% of its 2023 revenue. Nvidia is already working on the next generation of industry-leading AI processors, which is how it stays so far ahead of the competition."", ""Finally, there's the matter of Nvidia's valuation. At 79 times trailing 12-month earnings, the stock might seem exorbitantly expensive if not for three consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, with another likely on the way. However, Nvidia is selling for 38 times next year's earnings, and while that's a bit on the high side, it's justified by the company's meteoric growth."", ""However, for those looking beyond the current quarter, I believe Nvidia's track record and history of innovations speak for itself, making it a buy for investors intending to hold for years if not decades."", 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The collective gained 111%, on average, in 2023, thrashing the 24% gains of the S&P 500. The group has continued its winning ways, rising 22% on average so far this year, nearly double the 11% increase of the S&P 500 (as of this writing).', 'The common thread that unites these tech bellwethers is that they each have artificial intelligence (AI) in their DNA. In recent months, however, some investors have begun to fear that the rally that propelled the Magnificent Seven higher is no longer sustainable and have been looking to other quarters for growth.', 'Among those investors is billionaire David Tepper, who heads Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund he founded in 1993. Tepper is worth roughly $20.6 billion and has been called ""arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,"" for his knack for consistently outperforming his industry peers.', ""It's notable, then, that Tepper decreased his exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks to close out the first quarter."", ""A regulatory filing released just this week revealed that Tepper had made big changes among his largest holdings, decreasing his stake in each of the five Magnificent Seven stocks in Appaloosa's portfolio."", ""Tepper cut his stake in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by 44%. He obviously still believes there's additional potential, since Appaloosa still owns 442,000 shares worth an estimated $417 million (as of this writing). It's still the fund's fifth largest holding at roughly 6% of the portfolio."", ""The move was probably strategic on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia stock is up a massive 546% since early last year, thanks to accelerating demand for its AI-centric processors. Given its remarkable run, there's likely not as much upside -- at least over the short term."", ""Tepper also slashed his stake in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock by 39%, though it remains a cornerstone holding. Appaloosa still owns 1.1 million shares worth about $531 million, as the fund's fourth-largest holding."", ""Meta Platforms is the second-best performer among the Magnificent Seven, sporting gains of 293% since early last year. The digital advertising market is in the midst of a remarkable recovery, which will continue to boost Meta's fortunes, but Tepper clearly believes he can get better gains elsewhere."", 'Tepper also reduced his stakes in Microsoft by 18%, Alphabet by 10%, and Amazon by 3%, likely to raise funds for his latest purchases.', ""To me, the most surprising part of Tepper's move wasn't so much what he sold but what he bought instead, building his positions in a number of well-known Chinese stocks."", ""Appaloosa's biggest additions in Q1 are among China's most well-known companies."", ""Tepper boosted his stake in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) by 158%. Appaloosa now owns 11.25 million shares worth an estimated $814 million. That makes the company Appaloosa's No. 1 holding at more than 12% of the portfolio."", ""Alibaba is best known as one of the largest e-commerce providers in China, which includes its Taobao and T-mall sites. Alibaba Cloud is the world's fourth-largest cloud infrastructure provider, with 4% of the market, behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, with 31%, 25%, and 11%, respectively. The company has also been investing heavily in AI to boost its competitive advantages and has noted that much of its recent cloud growth has been driven by AI."", 'Tepper also increased his stake in PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), also known as Pinduoduo, by 171%. Appaloosa now owns 2.1 million shares worth an estimated $244 million. As a result, it has risen to its ninth-largest holding at nearly 4% of the portfolio.', ""Pinduoduo's online marketplace has become the world's second-largest e-commerce company and the largest in China. The company is leveraging its position by expanding internationally with its Temu platform and has been growing faster than its larger rival, Alibaba."", ""Finally, Tepper increased his stake in China's search leader Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) by 188%. The hedge fund now owns 1.8 million shares worth an estimated $190 million. As a result, it has risen to its 10th-largest holding at roughly 3% of the portfolio."", 'Aside from its search supremacy, Baidu is one of the largest digital advertisers in China and provides a host of internet and AI-related services.', ""It isn't too surprising that Tepper would see value in stocks from China. Earlier this year, China's CSI 300 Index fell to a five-year low as the country's economy continued to struggle. Contracting manufacturing activity, which had fallen for four successive months, helped fuel the decline."", ""This has driven the valuations of some of China's most popular stocks to multi-year lows. Even after an uptick in Q1, PDD, Alibaba, and Baidu are selling for 25 times, 20 times, and 14 times trailing 12-month earnings, a discount to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500."", ""Tepper's moves may have been wise. Over the past few months, there have been improvements in China's economic prospects. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased 5.3% year over year in Q1, while the manufacturing and services sectors grew by 6% and 5%, respectively."", 'That said, investors should be aware of the additional risk factors that are part of investing in China. The economy is still a wild card, government crackdowns can negatively affect investments, and relations between China and the U.S. are frequently rocky.', ""While Tepper's picks may seem intriguing, investors should merely use this information as a starting point and do their own research to determine if these stocks are a good fit with their investing philosophy and risk tolerance."", ""It's worth noting that Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Alphabet collectively still make up 38% of Tepper's portfolio, so he obviously believes each of these stocks has room to run. However, it's clear from his purchases this quarter that Tepper believes China stocks could have more upside."", 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

There are names out there that are reasonably or more-than-reasonably priced, that nonetheless offer the prospect of steady growth.', 'Screening for stocks using this criteria, I have come across the following seven best dividend stocks to buy.', 'Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.com', 'At current prices, Citigroup (NYSE:C) has a forward dividend yield of 3.38%. Admittedly, shares in the money center bank have not experienced much in the way of dividend growth over the past few years.', 'In 2023, Citi raised its quarterly payout from 51 cents to 53 cents per share, but prior to that, the last dividend increase had been implemented in 2019. However, given a key catalyst for C stock, a dividend growth spurt may be due. As I recently discussed, an in-progress turnaround may soon result in a big improvement to profitability.', 'Sell side forecasts call for Citigroup to report $7.18 per share in earnings next year. This estimate represents a 22.1% jump from forecasted 2024 earnings. These additional earnings could be key in the next series of dividend increases for the bank. Earnings growth would also likely result in price appreciation for shares.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'There is more than one reason why General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is one of the best dividend stocks to buy. For one, the defense contractor is a “dividend aristocrat,” with a 29-year track record of dividend increases.', 'GD’s forward yield of 1.94% may not sound very high, but the company’s dividend increases have averaged 7.14% annually over the past five years. Besides its dividend growth track record, GD stock is one of the top dividend stocks, thanks to the recession resistant nature of its underlying industry.', 'In fact, as geopolitical conflict intensifies across the globe, spurring demand from the U.S. and its allies, growth prospects are bright. Analyst consensus calls for General Dynamics to grow earnings by nearly 12% next year. If achieved, this growth will be sufficient to sustain recent levels of dividend growth, as well as drive a steady move higher for the stock.', 'Source: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.com', 'Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) has been on a tear, and recent indication of success with its turnaround has fueled the latest rally. During the March quarter, Hasbro reported revenue and earnings that handily beat sell-side expectations.', 'After this post-earnings surge in price, HAS stock is up nearly 20% year-to-date, and has climbed more than 41% higher over the past six months. Yet while this may imply that the Hasbro comeback is already priced-in, I wouldn’t make that assumption. As the turnaround continues, further boosts to earnings may lie ahead.', 'The high end of forecasts for 2025 call for as much as $4.79 per share in annual earnings. This makes HAS reasonably priced at around $61 per share. Turnaround success also suggests that the company will maintain its dividend as is. That means investors can receive a 4.57% yield while they wait for the comeback to fully play out.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/ampersandphoto', 'Lancaster Colony (NASDAQ:LANC) may not be a company you’ve heard of, but chances are you know of at least one of this food purveyor’s branded food products. These products include New York Bakery garlic bread and Marzetti salad dressing.', 'Even if you are not a fan or even aware of these products, it’s hard to dispute that LANC stock isn’t one of the best dividend stocks to buy. With a 60 year dividend growth track record, forget about mere “dividend aristocrat” status, for LANC is a “dividend king.”', 'Shares currently yield 1.83%. Payouts have grown by an average of 6.96% annually for the past five years. Although pricey on paper, at 31.2 times forward earnings, as earnings continue to grow at a high single-digit/low double-digit clip, this valuation is likely sustainable. After a pullback in early April, now may be an opportune time to buy.', 'Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com', 'In prior coverage of top dividend stocks, I’ve talked about Paychex’s (NASDAQ:PAYX) key rival in the payroll processing space: Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). However, PAYX has many of the same dividend growth bona fides as its larger competitor.', 'Although not quite yet at “dividend aristocrat” status, PAYX stock appears to be on the path towards reaching this status. Paychex has increased its payout 9 years in a row, and by an average of 9.68% over the past five years.', 'Shares currently sport a 3.23% forward yield, which is well above ADP’s forward yield of 2.28%. Yes, this gap may have a lot to do with ADP’s higher level of expected earnings growth. However, if you are looking for returns driven more strongly by dividend payouts than price appreciation, between these two solid dividend growth opportunities, PAYX could be your preferred option.', 'Source: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com', 'Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is another of the best dividend stocks to buy that has been performing well lately. Shares in the mobile chip company have hit a new 52-week high, thanks to the reporting of strong quarterly results on May 1.', 'In the release, Qualcomm beat forecasts, as well as provided updates to guidance that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. These latest numbers provide a stronger indication that normalizing device chip demand, plus rising demand for the company’s automotive and AI chips, will lead to further strong results in the quarters ahead.', 'Besides keeping QCOM stock, reasonably priced at 18.2 times forward earnings, on an upward trajectory, earnings growth may also result in further dividend growth. QCOM currently has a forward yield of 1.88%, but the company has raised its payout 20 years in a row and by an average of 5.23% annually over the past five years.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock', 'VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership of casino real estate. This REIT owns the land and buildings housing many of Las Vegas’ legendary casinos, as well as properties housing regional casinos across the U.S. and Canada.', 'With the steady rental income generated from these properties, investors in this house always win. VICI stock today has a forward dividend yield of 5.67%. Since going public in 2017, Vici has raised its payout each year. The REIT implemented its latest increase last September, raising the quarterly payout by 6.4% to 41.5 cents per share.', 'Besides benefiting from further lease escalations, there’s also another driver for future growth. With billions in liquidity on hand, Vici has the capability to make more needle-moving acquisitions and investments.

The international coffee chain's stock is down around 20% year to date after posting weak traffic numbers and revenue growth for the first quarter. CEO Howard Schultz is giving confusing advice to the management team on LinkedIn, and the Chinese market is proving highly competitive as cheap coffee shops flood the market."", ""Right now, Starbucks is an uncertain story facing major headwinds. The same can't be said for the up-and-coming coffee chain Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS). Shares are up nearly 20% this year after putting up great volume growth, profit margins, and unit count growth. Its brand is becoming more popular as management hopes to spread from its Northwest roots to other markets in the U.S."", ""Between these two coffee specialists, here's why you should consider buying Dutch Bros over Starbucks for your portfolio right now."", 'For the first quarter of 2024, Dutch Bros reported 10% same-shop sales growth. The company defines this number as the year-over-year revenue growth from restaurants that have been open at least 15 months as of the start of the reporting period. Also known as comparable sales, this is an important metric for analyzing traffic shifts and pricing power for a restaurant brand.', 'Management said both traffic and ticket size increased in the quarter, marking two straight quarters of traffic growth to Dutch Bros locations.', ""The rest of the earnings report looked solid too. Dutch Bros' restaurant contribution margin expanded from 24.2% in Q1 2023 to 29.8% last quarter. This led to the company reporting a positive operating margin of 9.3%, while net income flipped from a $9.4 million loss a year ago to a $16.2 million profit."", ""Starbucks' numbers moved in the opposite direction. Its comparable sales declined 4% globally with traffic to stores falling 6% year over year. Operating margin contracted to 12.8% in the period. It's possible Dutch Bros will surpass Starbucks based on operating margin in the near future. This would have been unthinkable when Dutch Bros went public with steady losses. That shows the impressive progress the brand has made in the last few quarters."", 'At the end of Q1, Dutch Bros had 876 shops, up from 716 a year ago. The company is opening over 30 shops a quarter as it spreads from the West Coast to the East Coast. Its long-term goal is to have over 4,000 drive-up coffee stands in its home market, meaning it can still steadily grow its unit count over the next 10 to 20 years.', ""Management also noted that members of its Dutch Rewards program accounted for 66% of all transactions last quarter, up approximately 150 basis points year over year. Loyal customers contribute to the company's positive comparable sales growth, giving Dutch Bros the opportunity to profitably expand its business long term."", ""On the other end of the unit count spectrum is Starbucks. It has 16,600 stores in the U.S. and 38,951 total around the globe. While it's possible for Starbucks to grow its store count too as management hopes to reach 55,000 locations, it's not the the same growth opportunity Dutch Bros has to more than quadruple its footprint."", ""Dutch Bros clearly has a lot of momentum, but that doesn't mean it's automatically a good stock to buy. Good stocks are high-quality businesses with undemanding valuations."", ""Today, Dutch Bros has average unit volumes (AUVs) from its coffee stands of $2 million. Even if AUV remains unchanged, the company's expansion will see its revenue rise proportionally to its store count. In reality, steady same-shop sales growth will likely see AUV increase too, again highlighting the clear path for Dutch Bros to grow its sales to much higher levels."", 'With that in mind, the stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.5 as of this writing, compared to 2.4 for Starbucks and 2.8 for the S&P 500. With its appealing growth runway and rising profitability coming at a discount to the broad market, Dutch Bros look like a great stock to buy right now.', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dutch Bros wasn’t one of them.

And as manufacturers develop new reduced-risk products to help wean smokers off cigarettes, new avenues of growth open. With the tobacco industry going through a major overhaul, investors are looking for the next top tobacco stock.', 'Combustible cigarettes are still the industry’s mainstay. Where tobacco products represent a near-$1 trillion opportunity in 2024, cigarettes hold the largest share at $854 billion, according to Statista. Still, it is no longer a high-growth business, but rather a mature, steady-state one. Investors can only expect low, single-digit growth. Where the real opportunity lies in dividend payments.', 'All of the major tobacco stocks pay dividends that yield 5% or more. Understanding their slow-growth business, the players have committed to returning much of their cash flows to shareholders in the form of dividends.

Let’s see which one would be the best fit for your portfolio.', 'Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com', 'United States tobacco giant Altria (NYSE:MO) is the first major cigarette company to consider. The owner of the iconic Marlboro brand, which owns 42% of the market, reported smokeable products represent 88% of total first-quarter revenue of $5.5 billion. Yet sales were down 3.6% from last year as volumes fell, though the industry as a whole saw volumes decline.', 'However, this was offset by an increase in oral tobacco products, primarily its on! nicotine pouches, which saw shipment volumes surge over 32% year-over-year. However, with just $651 million in revenue, it is a far smaller segment.', 'Altria is late to the electronic cigarette market. Well, it was early with its near-$13 billion investment in leading e-cig maker Juul Labs, but that turn into a fiasco that Altria eventually wrote off. The Food & Drug Administration blamed Juul for the rise in teenage vaping and mounted a relentless attack on the company. Juul used to own over three-quarters of the e-cig market but that share has since dropped to around a 24%. Good enough for second place but a far cry from its industry dominance.', 'But Altria bought third-place NJOY last year, which now has a 4.3% share and growing. It shipped 1 million units in the first quarter and 10.9 million consumables. NJOY is the only pod-based e-cig maker with FDA marketing authorization.', 'The tobacco stock pays a dividend that yields a mouth-watering 9.1% annually. Altria has raised its payout for over 50 consecutive years making it a Dividend King. The payout is solid as Altria generates more than enough free cash flow (FCF) to support the dividend.', 'Source: DutchMen / Shutterstock.com', 'Unlike Altria, rival British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) is a global tobacco company with 27.3 billion British pounds sterling (approximately $34.1 billion) in annual sales. The U.S., though, is its largest market representing 44% of total sales. BAT owns some of the most popular brands, including Newport, Camel, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.', 'British American is also the leading e-cig seller. Its Vuse brand of e-cigs commands a 42.4% share of the U.S. market. It was able to capitalize on the problems of Juul and essentially steal away the market from it. Global revenue in the segment jumped 47% in 2023 but saw the greatest gains in European markets including Germany, Italy and Poland.', 'The tobacco stock also saw strong growth in its nicotine pouch business it sells under the Velo brand. Revenue jumped 39% from the previous year in constant currency terms.', 'Arguably the most important change BAT has made is essentially saying its U.S. cigarette business is worth nothing. Last December, the tobacco company announced it would take a $31.5 billion charge as it believes the U.S. cigarette market will evaporate in 30 years. It will begin amortizing that part of its business beginning this year. To meet the challenge, it wants to generate half its revenue from non-combustibles by 2035.', 'The accounting change is going to impact BAT’s results going forward. And though it claims it is merely “accounting catching up with reality,” it may be a much too grim focus that undercuts its business. With a dividend yielding over 10% annually, British American Tobacco stock becomes a riskier play.', 'Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com', 'Spun off from the tobacco giant in 2007, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) has the leading e-cig on the market with its heated tobacco device IQOS.\xa0Although briefly introduced in the U.S. through a marketing agreement with Altria, the IQOS was banned from import after PM was sued by British American because the device violated BAT’s patents.', 'Philip Morris remains committed to moving away from cigarettes. The global tobacco giant, the largest tobacco company outside of China, reported its smoke-free business accounted for 39% of total net revenues. Organic revenue growth jumped almost 25% in the period and IQOS has the leading market share in many markets.', 'However, like its rivals, Philip Morris also saw a big jump in nicotine pouch sales with a 40% increase in Zyn brand volume driven by a near-80% surge in the U.S. market. Nicotine pouches may become the future of the tobacco industry. With no dangerous, acrid smoke from cigarettes and no annoying vapor clouds from e-cigs, users still get the nicotine hit they seek. Euromonitor International estimates pouches will be a $15 billion market in 2027.

While the company originally began as a DVD rental service, Netflix quickly pivoted to a streaming model.', 'For years, other media companies have tried to catch up and build their own streaming platforms. Outside of Netflix, some of the more prominent streamers come from industry giants like The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Amazon.', 'In my opinion, many of the streamers above only produce a couple of shows that you might watch once per year. So, how do these services acquire users and keep them sticky?', ""For a long time, the answer to that was assessing which platforms had the best original content. After all, in today's world, companies pay a premium for your attention. Considering how crowded the streaming realm has become, Netflix has swiftly pivoted once again."", ""While the competition is busy developing new television series with big celebrity names attached, Netflix is doing something different. Let's break down how Netflix is evolving from a run-of-the-mill streaming service to a full-blown entertainment conglomerate."", 'One of the biggest knocks against streaming, in general, is that audiences often have the option to watch an entire television series in one sitting. Although binging content offers some convenience, it often leaves you wanting more -- as you now need something new to watch.', ""Recently, Netflix has made an effort to move into live content. In other words, the platform is releasing content that you can tune into live -- just like real television. While this strategy is in its infancy, early indications are showing that it's resonating with audiences."", 'In early May, Netflix produced a live comedy event called The Roast of Tom Brady. The star-studded event captivated viewers as comedians, celebrities, and professional athletes joked about former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.', ""According to media outlets, the comedy special was viewed 2 million times on its opening night. In the week that followed, the show has now been viewed nearly 14 million times and is the No. 1 streamed show on Netflix's English TV library."", ""What's even more encouraging is that Netflix has a deep roster of other live events that it intends to sprinkle throughout the remainder of 2024."", ""In July, Netflix will be livestreaming a boxing match featuring social media sensation Jake Paul and boxing legend Mike Tyson. Between Instagram and YouTube, Jake Paul has over 45 million followers. Moreover, Paul is a co-founder of a sports betting app called Betr. Between Paul's fans and the rising popularity of sports betting, I am optimistic that the bout with Tyson will draw similar viewership to that of the Brady comedy special."", ""Lastly, Netflix just announced perhaps its biggest splash in the live entertainment landscape. For the next three years, Netflix will be livestreaming the NFL's Christmas day games. In 2023, the NFL aired three games on Christmas day, and each of these games averaged over 25 million viewers."", ""Clearly, the idea here is that Netflix entices new viewers to sign up in order to watch live events. Thereafter, once these new members are on the platform, it'll be on Netflix to curate content for these new subscribers so that they remain sticky."", 'Another new initiative at Netflix is its foray into immersive experiences. While these are not theme parks per se, Netflix Houses are brick-and-mortar locations that allow fans to experience recreations of sets of some of its most popular series.', ""I see this as Netflix taking a page right out of Disney's playbook. Disney has built an unparalleled level of brand equity from fans around the world. One of the reasons Disney resonates with fans is that it brings its beloved movies to real life through its theme parks."", ""I think Netflix House is a creative strategy because it will not require the same capital investment as a theme park. At the same time, it helps deepen fans' relationships with Netflix's content by providing them with a way to experience their favorite shows on a new level."", 'The chart below illustrates the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio among some media and entertainment companies. Based on a P/S of 7.8, Netflix is by far the most expensive stock in this cohort.', ""This isn't entirely surprising. Netflix shares have soared 80% over the last year. By comparison, Disney has struggled to gain momentum in the streaming landscape. Moreover, the company was the center of an activist investor battle earlier this year -- a move that likely caused some internal turbulence at Disney and was ultimately a distraction from its growth roadmap."", ""While Netflix stock is indeed a bit pricey, I see it as a compelling buy for long-term investors. In a way, I think Netflix is evolving into a new-age\xa0version of Disney. But it's different because the company's entertainment spans across many genres and demographics -- as opposed to Disney's predominantly family-friendly image."", 'Investors with a long-term horizon may want to consider scooping up some shares of Netflix, as the new growth narrative appears to be just be starting.', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Patience can pay huge dividends in investing.', ""With that prospect in mind, let's look at one stock that's primed for significant gains over the next several years. Read on for some killer reasons to be bullish on Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)"", 'Netflix has thrived through enough rounds of competitive attacks to give investors confidence that it can defend its premium market share position. The most recent one involved huge spending and price cuts by several rivals, including Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS).', ""These moves did impact the streaming video giant's growth rate in the pandemic's immediate aftermath. For a handful of quarters, investors feared that Netflix's days of high growth might be over. Why else would the company insist on tracking a different set of key metrics from now on? Surely, there must be something wrong with the previous focus on adding users above all else."", 'Yet Netflix is back in full expansion mode, having added 22.5 million new subscribers over the last six months. Disney and other competitors have had to slash budgets and boost prices in the meantime, as investors became less amenable to streaming video losses.', 'Netflix executives are clear on what sets the company apart.

I'm talking about Lilly drugs that doctors prescribe for weight loss: Mounjaro and Zepbound. They're both based on the same molecule, but regulators approved the product for type 2 diabetes under the name Mounjaro and specifically for weight management under the name Zepbound."", 'The company won approval for Mounjaro first, back in 2022, and that drug brought in more than $1.8 billion in the most recent quarter. Zepbound, approved late last year, generated about $517 million in its first full quarter on the market. Lilly dominates the weight loss scene along with Novo Nordisk, a maker of two drugs that function in a similar manner.', ""But other companies aim to get in on the billion-dollar market, and just recently, big biotech Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) reported promising news from a clinical trial of its weight loss candidate MariTide. Does this represent a threat to Eli Lilly's drugs and its overall earnings prospects? Let's find out."", 'First, let\'s talk about the Amgen news. The biotech company is studying MariTide, a molecule that blocks the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) -- a receptor for a hormone involved in obesity -- and acts on the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor, which interacts with a hormone that regulates blood-sugar levels. The MariTide phase 2 trial is ongoing, with full data expected later this year, but the company said it\'s ""very encouraged"" by interim results.', 'The next step will be a phase 3 trial to study the candidate in obesity, diabetes, and obesity-related conditions. Amgen aims to deliver MariTide through a handheld auto-injector device, with dosing monthly or even less frequently.', ""Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro work in a similar way, acting on GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and thus helping control blood-sugar levels and appetite. They come in a pen format that patients can inject on their own on a weekly basis."", 'Where MariTide may have an advantage is its dosing frequency: If patients are able to administer it less frequently than another weight loss drug, and still benefit from solid efficacy, it could win market share.', 'So does this mean Eli Lilly should start worrying? Not necessarily.', ""First, it's important to note that though MariTide's data are positive so far, the candidate still has a way to go before reaching commercialization. During that time, there's always the possibility of a setback or disappointment, so its future presence on the market isn't a sure thing."", ""Second, if MariTide does reach commercialization, it may face more than Lilly's current weight loss drugs -- it may face even newer ones. Eli Lilly isn't sitting still and counting only on Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company has other studies underway, on candidates that could improve on its current drugs."", ""For example, it's studying retatrutide, an obesity candidate that targets three hormones involved in digestion -- today's obesity drugs target just one or two. The company is aiming for its approval in obesity, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes. And Lilly is also investigating orforglipron, an oral daily candidate for weight management. Both candidates are involved in phase 3 studies."", ""Finally, it's important to note that demand is so high for safe and effective weight loss drugs that there's room for more than one or two companies to be successful. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have both been unable to keep up with demand and have been pushed to invest in greater manufacturing capacity. Goldman Sachs Research suggests that demand is set to continue, and that the weight loss drug market could increase 16 times to reach $100 billion by 2030."", ""What does that mean for you as an investor? Often, when a potential rival reports positive data from a weight loss candidate, Lilly's shares decline. But you really shouldn't worry about Lilly's position in this billion-dollar market. The company, along with Novo Nordisk, is a leader today, and has candidates in late-stage trials that could add to growth down the road."", ""And, as mentioned above, there's room for multiple players in this high-growth market. So if you're looking for a combination of growth and the stability often associated with healthcare companies, Eli Lilly still makes a great buy today."", 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

The stock has rallied strongly over the past six months or so, which is great news for existing shareholders.', ""But is the stock worth buying today? That will depend a lot on how you view NextEra Energy's current (and future) performance. Here's what you need to know."", ""In the first quarter of 2024, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings rose to $0.91 per share, up from $0.84 in the same part of 2023. That's a solid 8% gain, and somewhat uncommon for a utility. Both the company's regulated utility business, largely made up of Florida Power & Light, and its clean energy operations, known as NextEra Energy Resources, had good quarters, with net income per share up roughly $0.04 in each division."", 'But the most compelling news from the company\'s earnings release was probably management\'s comment that it ""... will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each year through 2026, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings."" Basically, the company\'s strong results are on track with management\'s long-term plan.', 'That plan, meanwhile, calls for earnings growth of between 6% and 8% per year through 2026. And on top of that, management is saying that it will grow the dividend a hefty 10% per year through 2026 as well. These are both very material numbers for a utility, a sector that is usually known for slow and steady results.', ""If you own NextEra Energy you should be pleased. That's particularly true if you stepped into the stock in late 2023 when share prices fell dramatically, pushing the dividend yield up toward decade highs of around 3.5%. In hindsight, that now looks like it was a huge buying opportunity."", ""But since that price low point, NextEra Energy's stock has rallied strongly. Over the past six months, share prices have gained over 30%. It isn't nearly as compelling a purchase as it once was -- note that the forward dividend yield is now around 2.7%. While that's not a terrible yield for NextEra Energy, it is just average. And given that the average utility, using Vanguard Utilities Index ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU) as a proxy, is yielding 3.2%, investors looking for income probably won't find NextEra Energy attractive at these levels."", ""But what if your dividend investing goals aren't focused on yield, but are instead focused on dividend growth? Well, you'll still be hard-pressed to find a utility that offers the dividend growth that NextEra Energy is promising investors. And notably, that growth is coming from two strong businesses, not just one. NextEra Energy is not just offering dividend growth, but that growth is built atop a uniquely diversified utility business."", ""At the end of the day, NextEra Energy isn't going to be the perfect investment for all investors. It is, at its core, a dividend growth stock. And if that's what you are looking for, then it is still worth a close look. Given the continuing strength of the business, and management's upbeat outlook, there's no reason to believe anything has changed about the long-term trajectory of the dividend."", 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

On Monday, Piper Sandler initiated coverage on MasterCard at Overweight with a $531 price target.', 'What’s the full story? Piper projects that Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is on track to achieve a revenue growth of 11.0% this fiscal year, with an even stronger performance expected in FY25, where a 12.7% growth is anticipated. This growth is primarily fueled by the Payment Network sector, which is predicted to see a 9.5% increase in revenue this year and a 13.5% surge in FY25, accounting for about 62% of Mastercard’s total revenue. Concurrently, the Value-added Services and Solutions are expected to grow by 13.7% in FY24 and 11.5% in FY25, representing approximately 38% of the overall revenue.', 'The brokerage underscores the significant potential in consumer payments as a pivotal growth catalyst for Mastercard. The company’s current transaction volume stands at a staggering $9 trillion annually, with a Total Addressable Market (TAM) exceeding $250 trillion across various revenue channels, including domestic and cross-border transactions, processing, and value-added services.', 'Moreover, Piper anticipates that Mastercard will maintain its trajectory of margin expansion, with forecasts of an increase by 20 basis points (bps) in FY24 and a notable 80 bps in FY25, as the company continues to innovate and disrupt traditional cash transactions, expanding into new services and technological offerings.', 'Overweight at Piper means “Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.”', 'How did the stock react?

On Tuesday, Jefferies upgraded Boston Beer to Buy with a $360 price target.', 'What’s the full story? Jefferies reports a positive outlook for Flavored Malt Beverages (FMBs) and Ready-to-Drink (RTD) products, anticipating growth of 4-5%, which is expected to come at the expense of Seltzers and Domestic beers. Hard Teas are emerging as the dominant category within this space, with key brands garnering 43% of honorable mentions. Leading the charge is Twisted Tea, accounting for 19% of these mentions, now surpassing Truly in market size. This shift indicates a significant trend inflection for SAM (Segment-Addressable Market).', 'The brokerage notes that while the malt-based seltzer industry is on a downward trend, with Truly experiencing continued market share losses, Boston Beer’s cider and beer portfolios are also facing a secular decline. However, the strong performance of Twisted Tea within the flavored malt beverage segment is providing a cushion against these declines. Despite this, the overall volume deleverage across seltzer, beer, and cider categories is contributing to a delayed recovery in Gross Margin (GM) percentage.', 'Buy at Jefferies means “Describes securities that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 15% or more within a 12-month period.”', 'How did the stock react?

On Wednesday, Wolfe Research downgraded SunPower to Underperform with a $2 price target.', 'What’s the full story? I deeply agreed with this call as the company was part of the meme stock gamble which was predictably irrational. Shares traded up to the higher-end of a $5 handle on Tuesday. The company has no way to issue an offering at its lofty and unhinged price level. Also, Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research had a great write up which I posted to Investing.com Premium users at the time of its dissemination midday Tuesday, link here. This was a simple and confident call at a great time, like catching the last of a good set when surfing.', 'Wolfe Research has highlighted SunPower as a standout example of the recent meme stock phenomenon within the Clean Tech sector. Despite a lack of positive fundamental updates, SPWR’s stock has surged approximately 100% week-to-date, driven by a significant short squeeze. This market movement was sparked by the company’s high short interest of around 95%, which caught the attention of retail investors, leading to 65% of the float being traded on Tuesday alone. Adding to the volatility, SPWR has announced a delay in filing its 1Q24 10-Q due to ongoing issues with internal controls and past financial misstatements.', 'The brokerage remains optimistic about the home solar market, buoyed by incentives such as the Inflation Reduction Act and rising utility bills. Wolfe Research appreciates certain aspects of SPWR’s business strategy, which provides clearer financials and less exposure to interest rate fluctuations compared to its peers. However, the lack of a contracted revenue or cash flow base poses challenges, especially as residential sales have slowed since 2023. Although SPWR has navigated past bankruptcy risks from debt covenant breaches, it may require additional capital in 2024. The ongoing search for a new CEO further contributes to the uncertainty surrounding the company’s strategic direction.', ""Underperform at Wolfe means “The security is projected to underperform analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.”"", 'How did the stock react? SunPower opened the regular session at $3.44 and closed at $3.11, a decline of 29.16% from the prior day regular close.', 'What happened? On Thursday, Wolfe Research upgraded Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to Peer Perform. The firm does not issues price targets for Peer Perform equities.', 'What’s the full story? Wolfe Research maintains its cautious stance on Intel, despite the stock’s 38% decline year-to-date (YTD), which has underperformed the Semiconductor Index (SOX) by approximately 60% YTD and 40% since the brokerage’s July initiation. The recent foundry event and earnings reports have reinforced Wolfe Research’s thesis, aligning with the current low market sentiment towards INTC. The brokerage’s primary concern is that the growth in server CPU sales is insufficient to cover the substantial capital expenditures and depreciation associated with INTC’s ambitious 5N4Y manufacturing strategy. This viewpoint was corroborated by INTC’s own forecast, which does not anticipate the manufacturing division to reach breakeven until Calendar Year 27, with profitability hinging on an expanded foundry business towards the decade’s end.', 'Challenges aside, Wolfe’s team expects some incremental improvement in INTC’s Gross Margin in CY25, as startup costs are projected to decrease and the company starts to internalize more production processes. However, these improvements are expected to be modest. With these factors now priced into investor expectations, Wolfe Research acquired a more neutral stance at Peer Perform.', ""Peer Perform at Wolfe means “The security is projected to perform approximately in line with analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.”"", 'How did the stock react?

Over the last 50 years, they have outperformed non-payers by more than 2 to 1. A big driver is their steady (and often growing) income stream, which provides investors with a solid base return year in and year out.', ""One Liberty Properties (NYSE: OLP), Truist Financial (NYSE: TFC), and Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE: MAA) have magnificent records of paying dividends. That's one of the factors that make them stand out to a few Fool.com contributors. Here's why they believe investors won't regret buying these top-notch dividend stocks right now. "", ""Tyler Crowe (One Liberty Properties): There are many shorthand ways investors assess the viability of a dividend for years into the future. One of the more underappreciated ones is when founding families have large company ownership. When a family's income comes from a single stock's dividend payments, you can be reasonably sure that the company will be managed to preserve those dividend payouts."", 'That has been the case with One Liberty Properties for many years. The Gould family founded the real estate investment trust (REIT) and still owns 27.4% of the outstanding shares. Their large stake in the REIT has likely been why the company has paid consecutive dividends for over 30 years.', ""A long dividend history is a little impressive, but what emphasizes the company's commitment to its dividend is that management has maintained its payout even though it has undergone a complete portfolio transformation. Over the past decade, the company went from a diversified REIT with a smorgasbord of properties (fitness centers, furniture stores, offices, and restaurants) to a mostly industrial warehouses and distribution facilities portfolio. In 2016, industrial made up about 22% of annualized rent.\xa0Today, industrial properties make up 67%."", 'This portfolio transformation was challenging. Funds from operations stagnated, and it had to take on more debt than most investors would be comfortable with. Despite these headwinds, it paid its dividend like clockwork.', ""With a transformed portfolio and improved financials, it won't be surprising to see One Liberty Properties start increasing its payout. At a current yield of 7.5%, that could be a pretty attractive stock."", ""Jason Hall (Truist Financial): Admittedly, banks can be both very safe and very risky investments. They're leveraged (they have a lot of cash but lend most of it out) and very tied to the overall economy. Further, sentiment can drive their share prices down painfully when there are worries about the economy. That can also create opportunity for investors, too, particularly if you focus on the strongest, best-capitalized banks that can weather economic storms and keep paying their shareholders."", 'Truist Financial is on that shortlist for me. It has consistently earned mid- to high-teens returns on common tangible equity, kept its expense ratio (how much of its revenues must cover operations) in the high-50% to low-60% range, and retained more than sufficient liquidity to meet depositor needs and secure its balance sheet.', ""And while its earnings have faced a bit of a squeeze due to the surge in interest rates that's slowing lending and a very weak supply of homes affecting the mortgage market, it still generates strong earnings well in excess of its dividend. Last quarter, it earned $0.81 per share, putting its payout ratio at 64% for the quarter."", 'With a yield above 5% and shares trading for just over 9 times earnings, investors willing to buy and hold for many years will not regret investing in Truist Financial right now.', ""Matt DiLallo (Mid-America Apartment Communities): Apartment REIT Mid-America Apartment Communities, or MAA, has done a magnificent job paying a stable and growing dividend. The company paid its 121st consecutive quarterly dividend last month. It has increased its payout for 14 straight years, including by 5% late last year. The REIT currently yields over 4%, about three times the S&P 500's roughly 1.3% dividend yield."", ""A big factor causing that high yield is the 40% decline in the REIT's share price from its peak in 2022 due to higher interest rates. They have weighed upon the value of real estate and made it more expensive for the REIT to borrow money to fund new developments and acquisitions. MAA has also faced some near-term rent growth headwinds due to increased new supply in many of its markets."", 'However, those headwinds should fade over the next few quarters. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it plans to start lowering interest rates as inflation moderates, which many expect will happen later this year. In addition, MAA believes that new supply deliveries will decline later this year and into 2025 as the market absorbs all the new units currently coming online. This catalyst should ""fuel a strong and quick rebound in rent performance,"" according to CEO Eric Bolton.', ""MAA also has a strong balance sheet, positioning it to capitalize on emerging new growth opportunities. The REIT recently started construction on a new development and bought land to build another project. Those projects are among the four to six it expects to start over the next two years, adding to the five it already has under construction. Add that to rent growth and falling rates, and MAA could produce strong total returns in the coming years. With ample upside catalysts and a growing dividend, you won't regret buying MAA here.

But at present, Under Armour, founded by a 23-year-old former college athlete, is struggling to “just do it.”', 'Instead, the brand that’s championed on the basketball court by Stephen Curry and on the golf course by Jordan Spieth, is now struggling — badly — to find its footing in an increasingly competitive and crowded sportwear marketplace for regular folks, where younger shoppers are more googly-eyed over newer entrants like Hoka and On running shoes.', 'Under Armour’s annual sales have been sluggish at best for the past several years, while its stock has plunged 88% from its all-time high in 2015. Industry experts said the company is mired in an unpleasant mix of problems, which include an identity crisis, several management controversies, ignoring evolving market trends to its detriment, and a rotating carousel of CEOs in quick succession.', 'One of them is Kevin Plank, its founder, who is back at the helm for a second time as CEO after being replaced in 2019. Similar to Starbucks founder Howard Schultz’s past returns to Starbucks and Disney chief Bob Iger’s recent return as CEO, Plank aims to right the ship at Under Armour.', '“When Under Armour was growing at 20% plus numbers, people saw it as a legitimate competitor to Nike,” said David Swartz, senior equity analyst with research firm Morningstar, in an interview with CNN.', '“It was like On or Hoka but 10 years ago. It was the upstart athletic brand that was making real inroads against Nike, the dominant name in the industry. People saw it as a company that actually could break through and take market share from Nike among the hardcore athletes,” Swartz said. “That actually did happen for a while, but then that didn’t last.”', 'Plank launched Under Armour in 1996 to be what the name suggests — a protective layer of clothing worn by competitive athletes sweating it out in the heat of the game.', 'The first product was a fitted T-shirt called “The Shorty,” made from moisture-wicking fabric for elite athletes to wear under their uniforms to keep them dry. Its iconic Under Armour intertwined “U” and “A” logo was strategically placed on the neckline, to keep it conspicuous.', 'The T-shirt eventually launched the brand to the masses after it quickly gained fandom among the ranks of professional athletes. The startup’s fast track to success led to Under Armour going public in 2005. It’s early slogan: “Protect This House.”', 'By 2010, the business had crossed $1 billion in sales. Five years later, sales surpassed $4 billion. But then the momentum started to wane.', 'The past eight years for Under Armour have been a struggle that doesn’t appear to be abating.', 'The company on Thursday announced a restructuring of its business as its North America sales in its most recent quarter tumbled 10%. Looking ahead, the company cast a dour forecast for its current fiscal year, expecting sales to drop 15% to 17%. Layoffs will be part of the effort to right the ship but executives did not specify how many employees will lose their jobs.', 'Under Armour also announced a $500 million share buyback, a move to reward shareholders.', 'Plank told analysts during the earnings call on Thursday that he will shepherd a reset of the business that centers on selling fewer but more innovative products to meet the needs of athletes, significantly accelerating product development, refocusing on its men’s apparel category and reducing discounts of its products.', '“We are simply doing too much stuff. There are too many products, too many initiatives. To reconstitute this brand, we must be highly focused and prioritize what needs to get done so that our teams know exactly what to do with a clear definition of success for them,” Plank said.', 'It can’t be ignored that management issues, too, have plagued the business for years, Swartz said.', '“The company has essentially had five CEOs in the past five years, if you count Kevin Plank twice,” said Swartz. Plank was announced as CEO — again — in March, ending the very brief year-long tenure of Stephanie Linnartz.', 'Plank conceded during the analysts call Thursday that frequent C-suite turnover had become a serious impediment to success.', '“With several CEOs and heads of product, marketing in North America over the past half-decade, ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive,” he said.', 'The period from 2016 onward is when “things really started to fall apart” at Under Armour, Swartz said. A huge issue arose when an important channel of distribution for the brand went bankrupt and closed stores.', 'A bulk of Under Armour products are sold through sporting goods retailers and department stores, including Macy’s and Kohl’s, and online.', '“When Sports Authority went bankrupt in 2016 it really hurt Under Armour. It was a major customer of the brand, as is Dick’s Sporting Goods,” Schwartz said.', 'In 2020, UCLA sued Under Armour for ending a $280 million sponsorship deal. The suit alleged that Under Armour was struggling before Covid-19 and that it used the pandemic as a reason to get out of the deal.', 'The 15-year sponsorship deal, signed in 2016, was the largest in the history of college sports at the time. In exchange for the $280 million, UCLA’s student athletes and personnel would wear and use Under Armour (UA)-supplied products exclusively. The company reached a settlement with UCLA.', 'The following year, Under Armour paid $9 million to settle a multi-year investigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commission into its past accounting practices, according to Footwear News.', 'Outside of other bad press for Plank, competitors were gaining ground on Under Armour, whose high-performance sportwear offerings weren’t best suited for the Lululemon-driven athleisure trend that had emerged and then dominated the way consumers dressed through the pandemic.', '“Under Armour has failed to latch upon streetwear, or sports style that catapulted On or Hoka or Merrell,” said Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce, with market research firm eMarketer, in an interview with CNN. “It needs to figure out what is next. If it can’t do that, then it needs to quickly latch upon what another brand has identified as the next big thing.”', 'Stambor questioned Plank’s decision to pull back from discounts at a time when consumers are hyper focused on value.', '“It carries the risk of decreasing demand particularly when you don’t have a must-have product,” he said. Stambor said this decision also stands in stark contrast to a recent move that rival Adidas has made to roll out cheaper versions of their must-have shoes.', 'Despite it’s significant challenges, Stambor said Under Armour can remain relevant in the market. “It is a very large company with huge revenue. It’s not as though the brand has fully diminished in standing. It’s a bit stuck,” he said.', '“Under Armour needs to identify what it is that consumers want and lean heavily in that direction. It hasn’t fully shown an ability to do so over the past few years,” he said.', 'One area that’s going strong is the brand’s long-term celebrity-brand partnerships, said Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group, a sports and entertainment firm that evaluates sponsorships and advertising campaigns.', '“Under Armour’s relationship with the ‘The Rock’, Dwayne Johnson, has been pretty effective. They’ve expanded to the United Football League, which is the football league that Johnson co-owns,” Smallwood said. “Their uniforms are Under Armour.”', 'Golf is another area where the brand is making inroads while the Stephen Curry partnership has kept the brand visible in the basketball world, Smallwood said.', 'The basketball superstar Curry, arguably the best shooter in history, famously signed with Under Armour instead of Nike in 2013. Meanwhile, the brand’s other major NBA star, Joel Embiid, quit Under Armour in 2023 a few months after he was named the league’s most valuable player.', 'Embiid signed a shoe deal with Skechers last month. Under Armour reportedly bid hard for a shoe deal with WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark, who many expect will sign with Nike.', '“The bottomline for Under Armour is for the brand to be clear about its identity,” he said. “Are they a shoe company? Are they an apparel company? At one point everyone else copied their mositure-wicking undershirt. Then maybe they had an identity crisis. It’s going to come down to deciding if they want to evolve into a lifestyle brand or stay in performance-based products.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments began a new position in the first quarter by acquiring 8.42 million shares. Daniel Sundheim at D1 Capital Partners also made a bold bet on Pfizer by purchasing 7.83 million shares for a new position.', 'Pfizer stock is up from its lowest point during the first quarter, but the pharmaceutical industry giant still offers a juicy 5.8% dividend yield at recent prices. Income-seeking investors will be glad to know the pharmaceutical giant has delivered annual payout raises since 2009.', ""Investors can expect Pfizer to announce another dividend raise this December. The company expects adjusted earnings to reach a range between $2.15 and $2.35 per share this year. That's more than it needs to meet the annual dividend commitment currently set at $1.68 per share."", ""Pfizer shares have been trading for the low multiple of about 12.9 times the midpoint of management's earnings expectation for 2024.

Pfizer will probably report a significant earnings bump in the quarters ahead as it unwinds overlapping operations.

The company received a record nine new drug approvals from the Food and Drug Administration last year."", 'Lower expenses in the near term and new product launches that could drive growth over the next decade make this stock look like a bargain that is appropriate for most income-seeking investors.', 'Decades of consecutive payout raises made Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) one of the most reliable dividend stocks on Wall Street until it slashed its payout earlier this year, from $0.48 to $0.25 per share. The stock has fallen so far that it offers a 5.5% yield at recent prices.', ""Despite announcing a slashed payout this January, Walgreens attracted several billionaire investors in the first quarter, including the recently deceased Jim Simons.

I'm here to tell you that the two can coexist perfectly. Some great dividend stocks are at the center of AI's growth today."", 'Two wonderful examples immediately come to mind: International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX). Here is why investors can count on these two AI stocks for solid passive income and total investment returns in the future.', 'International Business Machines -- or IBM as everyone calls it -- has continued to evolve. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, IBM was a one-stop shop for on-premise IT systems. However, the IT world changed with the emergence of cloud technology. IBM has steadily adapted over the years, spinning off its managed IT business as Kyndryl several years back. IBM stumbled and shrunk for a while but has clawed its way back to growth by focusing on hybrid-cloud solutions, the idea that companies need both cloud and on-premise equipment to meet their needs.', 'Consistent revenue growth resumed in 2022, and IBM recently tapped the mergers and acquisitions market with a $6.5 billion deal to acquire HashiCorp. The company specializes in automated solutions in hybrid-cloud IT, which IBM says gives it complete end-to-end hybrid-cloud services. HashiCorp does business with 85% of the Fortune 500 and has over 4,400 customers, giving IBM potential cross-selling opportunities over the long term.', 'Investors hope IBM can carve out its market share as companies with hybrid cloud setups seek new AI solutions.', ""In the meantime, investors can benefit from a healthy dividend that yields just under 4% today. That's what's cool about dividend stocks: they pay you to hold them. IBM is no stranger to paying dividends; it has paid and raised dividends for 29 consecutive years. A payout ratio of 48% supports the dividend so investors can feel good about its safety moving forward."", ""People are investing in all aspects of AI: chips, software, and more. But what about the real estate? Equinix has you covered there. It's a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates a network of 260 internet and data centers spread across five continents. In other words, it's a global multi-tenant data center provider. Companies can rent data center space, connect directly to cloud computing and storage, and pay Equinix to manage the infrastructure's day-to-day needs. It's like a data center in a box."", 'Equinix is a REIT, which makes it an outstanding dividend stock because REITs must pay at least 90% of their taxable income out as dividends. Equinix has paid and raised its dividend for 10 straight years. The company deals with over 10,000 customers, signing them to long-term leases that average over 18 years in the remaining term. Additionally, Equinix has generated 21 consecutive quarterly revenue growth, which shows how resilient the business is on the backs of secular cloud growth in recent years.', 'The business should remain busy for a while. According to research by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, global data center demand is expected to grow between 12% and 15% annually through 2030. AI will likely have a significant influence on this.', ""Of course, investors will enjoy stellar dividends while holding shares. The stock yields 2.1% today, but the payout has grown by an average of 10.5% annually over the past five years. The current payout is just 54% of funds from operations (a REIT's profits), so investors should look for more increases as AI tailwinds continue fueling consistent growth at the company."", 'Add it all up, and Equinix has the makings of a solid total return investment.', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

These companies are developing quantum computing systems capable of processing mountains of data in seconds, which would take decades for a conventional computer."", 'Quantum machines can execute multiple computations simultaneously, accelerating processing time, while typical computers must process data in a linear fashion. This means quantum systems can evolve AI beyond the abilities of the most powerful supercomputers, enabling AI to drive cars and help find cures to diseases.', ""Three businesses developing quantum computing technology have achieved impressive results. They are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ). Here's a look at how they are creating tech that can drive the next phase of AI."", 'Microsoft may be known for its ubiquitous Windows computer system, but it invested billions of dollars into artificial intelligence, including in OpenAI, the firm that helped to kick off the current AI wave with ChatGPT.', ""Microsoft's work in quantum computing sets it up to power future AI systems. The company began building quantum machines in 2006 and is pioneering a new type of quantum bit, or qubit for short, which is akin to a bit in a conventional computer. Every quantum computer employs subatomic particles to perform computations measured in qubits."", 'In April, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in its quantum computers by improving error rates by 800 times. Because subatomic particles are highly unstable, errors in calculations are prone to happen.', ""The company's error rate achievement represents the most reliable qubit on record, according to Microsoft. This marks a key step in producing quantum computers capable of realizing the next generation of AI."", ""Moreover, Microsoft's financial strength gives it an advantage in the space. The company has built one of the biggest cloud computing businesses in the world, enabling Microsoft to generate $61.9 billion in its fiscal third quarter that ended March 31, a 17% year-over-year revenue increase."", 'This helped the company produce strong fiscal Q3 free cash flow (FCF) of $21 billion, up 18% year over year. Microsoft can use its hefty FCF to fuel investments in quantum computing.', ""IBM's work in AI stretches back to the 1950s. Today, AI is a focus of the company. So, it makes sense that it would also invest in quantum systems."", 'In fact, IBM is seen as one of the leaders in quantum computing. It was the first company to make a quantum computer available in the cloud in 2016. Since then, Big Blue deployed over 80 quantum systems.', 'For instance, IBM partnered with Cleveland Clinic to provide AI and implement a quantum computer that was touted as the first dedicated to healthcare research. And last December, IBM released the first quantum computer with a 1,000-qubit processor.', ""Big Blue can finance quantum computing research because of its solid FCF generation. This not only funds business investments but also the company's hefty dividend, currently yielding around 4%."", 'In Q1, the company produced $1.9 billion in FCF, up 43% from the prior year. IBM expects 2024 FCF to come in around $12 billion, ensuring Big Blue can continue to fund its quantum computing work.', 'As an investment, IBM is more of an income stock than a fast-growing tech stock. Its Q1 revenue of $14.5 billion represented only 1% year-over-year growth due to softness in its consulting and infrastructure businesses.', 'However, its software division, which includes sales from AI and quantum computing, is doing well.

You could take a flyer on the latest cryptocurrency or hyped AI growth stock. Those bets could turn your investment into a lot more money, or they could lose some or all of your investment. ', ""A lower-risk option is to invest that cash into an income-generating investment like dividend stocks. While you can still lose money investing in dividend stocks, they've historically been a solid investment. Over the last 50 years, the average dividend stock in the S&P 500 has delivered a 9.2% annualized total return (more than double the 4.3% return of non-payers), according to data from Hartford Funds and Ned Davis Research. At that rate, you could double your money in eight years, with the dividend income contributing significantly to the higher return. "", 'There are lots of good dividend stocks to choose from. Vici Properties (NYSE: VICI), Verizon (NYSE: VZ), and Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) stand out for their ability to pay high-yielding and steadily rising dividends, making them ideal passive income investments.', 'Vici Properties is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns experiential properties like casinos and other hospitality and entertainment properties. The company leases these properties back to the operator under very long-term net leases. That lease structure requires its tenants to cover building insurance, maintenance, and real estate taxes, enabling the REIT to collect very stable rental income. ', ""The company pays out about 75% of its steady cash flow to investors via a dividend yielding around 5.5%. That's several times above the average stock (given the S&P 500's 1.4% dividend yield). The REIT would turn a $1,000 investment into about $55 of annual dividend income at that rate. "", 'VICI Properties has done a stellar job growing its dividend since it came public in 2018. It has delivered a peer-leading dividend growth rate of 7.9%, well above the 2.2% average. The REIT is in an excellent position to continue growing briskly. It retains about a quarter of its steady cash flow, which it uses along with its strong balance sheet to fund new investments. Recent investments have included a $105 million construction loan to support a Margaritaville Resort development (that it has the option to acquire), up to $700 million to fund renovations at The Venetian Resort Las Vegas, and a $250 million loan backed by several Great Wolf Resorts. These and future investments should grow its cash flow and dividends. ', 'Natural gas pipeline giant Kinder Morgan generates very stable cash flow. It gets paid fixed fees as volumes flow through its pipeline assets. The company pays out about half its steady cash flow to shareholders via a dividend yielding almost 6%. ', ""The company uses the cash it retains to fund high-return expansion projects, repurchase shares, and maintain its financial flexibility. Kinder Morgan currently has about $3.3 billion of capital projects under construction that it expects to complete over the next few years. They'll supply it with incremental income as they come online. Kinder Morgan will also use its financial flexibility to make acquisitions. For example, it purchased a portfolio of natural gas pipelines in South Texas late last year for $1.8 billion. "", ""Kinder Morgan's growth investments give it the fuel to increase its already high-yielding dividend. It raised its payout by about 2% earlier this year, its seventh consecutive year of increasing its dividend. With plenty of growth coming down the pipeline, Kinder Morgan should have no problem continuing to push its payout higher. "", ""Telecom giant Verizon's dividend yield is nearly up to 7%. The company also produces very steady cash flow to cover its monster payout. Last year, it produced $37.5 billion in cash flow from operations, easily covering its capital expenses of $18.8 billion and dividends of $11 billion. The company used the remaining cash to strengthen its already solid balance sheet. "", 'Verizon has been investing heavily in building out its 5G network. That investment should pay dividends in the coming years by growing revenue, earnings, and cash flow. It should give the company the funds to continue paying down debt, increasing its dividend, and eventually starting to repurchase shares. ', 'The company gave its investors a modest raise of around 2% last fall. That was its 17th straight year of growing the dividend, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. With its free cash flow continuing to rise and balance sheet growing stronger, Verizon should have no trouble continuing to increase its dividend in the coming years. ', 'Because Vici Properties, Kinder Morgan, and Verizon pay much higher-yielding dividends than the average stock, they allow you to generate a lot more income from every dollar you invest.

Most recently, the company wowed investors with details of its new Blackwell architecture and said the launch will happen later this year. And prior to this, Nvidia said it aimed to start shipping its H200 graphics processing unit (GPU) -- which doubles the performance of its current chip -- in the second quarter of the year.', ""All of this along with soaring earnings have helped the stock roar higher, climbing more than 200% over the past year. Now, a couple of days ahead of Nvidia's quarterly earnings report, it's logical to wonder about the company's next big announcement. And my prediction is, this time, it may not have to do with an upcoming product. Instead, it may be a move that directly impacts Nvidia's share price..."", ""So, as mentioned, Nvidia's stock price has climbed in recent years, and today it's reached more than $940. Some analysts even see it surging well beyond $1,000 within the coming 12 months. It seems very possible considering Nvidia's earnings over the past several quarters. This leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market has reported triple-digit and even quadruple-digit gains in earnings, and growth isn't likely to taper off any time soon."", ""That's because we're in the early days of the AI story, so demand is far from reaching a peak. For example, the percentage of companies mentioning AI on their earnings calls has climbed significantly in recent years -- but it still was only at about 16% last year, according to Goldman Sachs, as quoted by Statista. So there's a lot of room for growth. And forecasts for an AI market worth more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade further support the idea of more growth to come."", ""Nvidia, in its forecast for the fiscal 2025 first quarter, has said it expects to report $24 billion in revenue -- representing yet another triple-digit increase in revenue year over year. And along with this and other news during Wednesday's earnings report, the company may make a big announcement directly related to share price."", 'I predict Nvidia may launch a stock split, a move that lowers the price of each individual share without changing the overall market value of the company. Companies do this by issuing additional shares to current holders.', ""Stock splits themselves aren't catalysts for share performance, but they can be positive for a company over time as they do make it easier for smaller investors to get in on a particular stock. The price of $1,000 for a stock represents a psychological barrier for some investors -- who automatically consider the price too high even if the actual valuation remains reasonable. And some investors don't have access to fractional shares or prefer buying full shares, pushing a $1,000 stock beyond their reach."", ""Now, let's consider Nvidia's stock split history, which shows the company is open to such moves. Nvidia has completed five stock splits over the past two decades, and on each occasion the stock was trading much lower than today's level. So it seems possible that now, with the stock approaching $1,000 and plenty of growth on the horizon to trigger additional gains, Nvidia would consider a new stock split."", ""Should you wait for a potential split to buy Nvidia or get in on the stock right now? The great news is you can do either. Nvidia is a market leader and focuses on the investment needed to remain in its position -- on top of this, the company happens to be operating in one of today's highest-growth areas."", ""Nvidia's prospects are bright, and that means whether you invest in, say, a fractional share today or wait to buy multiple shares if the company completes a stock split in the near future, the outcome will be the same. If you keep your Nvidia holding for the long term, you're likely to benefit as this exciting AI growth story unfolds."", 'So, whether my prediction is correct or not, an Nvidia purchase today or in the months to come, as part of a diversified portfolio, still may help you along the path to financial freedom over time.', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

That has contributed to its outperformance of market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite."", ""Low fees, however, are not the primary reason for VGT's market-crushing investment performance.

Some of the more notable stock splits in the tech realm in recent memory include ""Magnificent Seven"" members Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple.', 'While there are a number of upcoming stock splits to be aware of, there is one artificial intelligence (AI) company that I think could be next in line: ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW).', ""Let's dig into why ServiceNow makes a compelling stock-split candidate and explore the investment merits of this software-as-a-service (SaaS) leader."", 'Before diving into ServiceNow specifically, investors should understand the basics of stock splits.', 'Stock splits are essentially a form of financial engineering. The number of outstanding shares increases by the ratio in the split. For example, in a 5-for-1 split, there will be five times as many shares following the split.', 'As a result, the share price of the stock in question decreases by that same multiple. This dynamic means that the market cap of the stock-split stock does not inherently change.', 'One of the most common reasons that a company decides to split its stock is because shares have soared significantly over a relatively short time frame. As a result, most retail investors perceive shares as expensive and out of reach.', ""Again, although a stock split doesn't change the value of the company, investors tend to view shares as cheaper because the stock price is now lower. Subsequently, stock splits are typically followed by a new pool of investors pouring in."", ""Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2012, ServiceNow's shares are up 2,970%. Moreover, since AI has become a focal point among technology stocks in the last 18 months or so, ServiceNow shares have risen 77%."", ""With a share price of $755, ServiceNow stock doesn't look cheap. Considering the company has never split its shares and secular themes are fueling the AI landscape, now could be a unique opportunity for ServiceNow to follow in the footsteps of its larger tech peers as further gains look to be in store."", ""It's very important for investors to understand that the share price alone is not what determines a stock as over or undervalued. In fact, the chart below illustrates that ServiceNow is largely trading at a discount on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis when benchmarked against other SaaS growth stocks."", 'After analyzing the data above, there is a legitimate case to be made that ServiceNow is undervalued despite its seemingly expensive share price.', ""Another way of looking at this dichotomy is that it is not the number of shares that you own that matters; it's the amount of money you're putting to work. It's almost certainly a better idea to own one share of a $1,000 stock than 1,000 shares of a $1 stock. Generally speaking, the share price reflects the sentiment of the business."", ""As far as ServiceNow is concerned, there's one other reason I see the company as a potential stock-split opportunity. As I recently expressed, ServiceNow is not as well known in the technology and AI arenas as its competition. A stock split would be a good way for the company to make headlines and potentially land on the radar of a broader group of investors."", ""Now, with that said, I'm not suggesting that ServiceNow should use a stock split as a PR stunt to juice its price. Investors should buy shares in ServiceNow purely based on concrete business results."", ""Over the last several quarters, ServiceNow has moved swiftly in the AI world and it's showing in the company's results. Revenue growth is accelerating thanks to impressive customer retention metrics as well as ServiceNow's ability to cross-sell additional products and services."", 'Moreover, the company has forged partnerships with Microsoft, Nvidia, and International Business Machines. I see these as important stepping stones for further lead generation and new sales opportunities for long-term growth.', 'At the end of the day, ServiceNow is a rock-solid investment opportunity regardless of a split. Now looks like a great time to scoop up some shares and prepare to hold for the long term as the growth story continues to unfold.', 'Before you buy stock in ServiceNow, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ServiceNow wasn’t one of them.

Generative AI has myriad applications, and mega-cap-tech behemoths are leading innovation efforts across the industry.', 'One of the subtle growth opportunities in AI is data centers. In fact, Statista estimates that network infrastructure, storage, and server solutions will be a $439 billion opportunity by 2028.', 'Indeed, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have so far been big beneficiaries in data center-network services. However, smart investors know that there are peripheral opportunities outside of the obvious winners.', ""One AI data center stock that I've been monitoring is Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). Let's break down why Oracle could be a lucrative opportunity for long-term investors as the data center boom continues to unfold."", 'Outside of Nvidia and AMD, a number of other tech businesses are making a splash in the data center realm.', ""Vertiv is a unique opportunity that's been witnessing outsize growth from the rising demand for data center services. Moreover, the company's close ties to Nvidia certainly don't hurt."", ""Furthermore, Amazon recently announced an $11 billion investment to build out additional data center infrastructure. This isn't entirely surprising considering Amazon is a leader among cloud-computing platforms, and the company is developing its own semiconductor training and inferencing chips."", ""Back in March, Oracle announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Feb. 29). On the surface, the company's revenue growth of 7% year over year might appear mundane."", ""However, Oracle reported a number of other key performance indicators outside of traditional financial statements. Perhaps the most important of these metrics was remaining performance obligations (RPO). This is a critical operating metric because it measures a company's backlog, providing investors with a glimpse of future growth."", ""As of the end of Oracle's fiscal Q3, RPO grew 29% year over year to $80 billion -- a record for the company."", 'One of the reasons for such high backlog? Data centers. During the earnings call, Oracle\'s chairman, Larry Ellison, stated that the company ""is building data centers at a record level"".', ""He isn't exaggerating. Just this week, Bloomberg reported that one of Elon Musk's start-ups, xAI, is rumored to be talking to Oracle for a $10 billion deal to rent cloud servers."", 'The potential deal between Oracle and xAI does not make the stock a buy. The deal could fall apart, and there is no guarantee xAI will use Oracle for its cloud solutions.', ""With that said, I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal will come to fruition. Oracle already works with xAI as it pertains to other AI services. Moreover, Larry Ellison and Elon Musk have a well-publicized positive relationship -- so much so that Ellison used to serve on Tesla's Board of Directors."", 'The bigger idea here is that businesses are relying on more than just the legacy hyperscalers of Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia for their AI cloud needs. Whether Oracle closes its deal with xAI, I see the negotiations as a major source of validation that there will be many winners outside of big tech in the AI data center realm.', ""Although Oracle's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.9 isn't exactly dirt cheap, it is far below many of its peers."", 'I think now is a terrific opportunity to begin building a position in Oracle stock. As demand for AI cloud-storage solutions continues to rise, Oracle should see an influx of business from both new and existing customers.', ""The secular trends fueling AI represent a new growth narrative for Oracle, and I see now as a great time to scoop up some shares. The best days look like they are ahead for Oracle, and I'm bullish that further gains are in store for long-term shareholders."", 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

The collective gained 111%, on average, in 2023, thrashing the 24% gains of the S&P 500. The group has continued its winning ways, rising 22% on average so far this year, nearly double the 11% increase of the S&P 500 (as of this writing).', 'The common thread that unites these tech bellwethers is that they each have artificial intelligence (AI) in their DNA. In recent months, however, some investors have begun to fear that the rally that propelled the Magnificent Seven higher is no longer sustainable and have been looking to other quarters for growth.', 'Among those investors is billionaire David Tepper, who heads Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund he founded in 1993. Tepper is worth roughly $20.6 billion and has been called ""arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,"" for his knack for consistently outperforming his industry peers.', ""It's notable, then, that Tepper decreased his exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks to close out the first quarter."", ""A regulatory filing released just this week revealed that Tepper had made big changes among his largest holdings, decreasing his stake in each of the five Magnificent Seven stocks in Appaloosa's portfolio."", ""Tepper cut his stake in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by 44%. He obviously still believes there's additional potential, since Appaloosa still owns 442,000 shares worth an estimated $417 million (as of this writing). It's still the fund's fifth largest holding at roughly 6% of the portfolio."", ""The move was probably strategic on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia stock is up a massive 546% since early last year, thanks to accelerating demand for its AI-centric processors. Given its remarkable run, there's likely not as much upside -- at least over the short term."", ""Tepper also slashed his stake in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock by 39%, though it remains a cornerstone holding. Appaloosa still owns 1.1 million shares worth about $531 million, as the fund's fourth-largest holding."", ""Meta Platforms is the second-best performer among the Magnificent Seven, sporting gains of 293% since early last year. The digital advertising market is in the midst of a remarkable recovery, which will continue to boost Meta's fortunes, but Tepper clearly believes he can get better gains elsewhere."", 'Tepper also reduced his stakes in Microsoft by 18%, Alphabet by 10%, and Amazon by 3%, likely to raise funds for his latest purchases.', ""To me, the most surprising part of Tepper's move wasn't so much what he sold but what he bought instead, building his positions in a number of well-known Chinese stocks."", ""Appaloosa's biggest additions in Q1 are among China's most well-known companies."", ""Tepper boosted his stake in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) by 158%. Appaloosa now owns 11.25 million shares worth an estimated $814 million. That makes the company Appaloosa's No. 1 holding at more than 12% of the portfolio."", ""Alibaba is best known as one of the largest e-commerce providers in China, which includes its Taobao and T-mall sites. Alibaba Cloud is the world's fourth-largest cloud infrastructure provider, with 4% of the market, behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, with 31%, 25%, and 11%, respectively. The company has also been investing heavily in AI to boost its competitive advantages and has noted that much of its recent cloud growth has been driven by AI."", 'Tepper also increased his stake in PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), also known as Pinduoduo, by 171%. Appaloosa now owns 2.1 million shares worth an estimated $244 million. As a result, it has risen to its ninth-largest holding at nearly 4% of the portfolio.', ""Pinduoduo's online marketplace has become the world's second-largest e-commerce company and the largest in China. The company is leveraging its position by expanding internationally with its Temu platform and has been growing faster than its larger rival, Alibaba."", ""Finally, Tepper increased his stake in China's search leader Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) by 188%. The hedge fund now owns 1.8 million shares worth an estimated $190 million. As a result, it has risen to its 10th-largest holding at roughly 3% of the portfolio."", 'Aside from its search supremacy, Baidu is one of the largest digital advertisers in China and provides a host of internet and AI-related services.', ""It isn't too surprising that Tepper would see value in stocks from China. Earlier this year, China's CSI 300 Index fell to a five-year low as the country's economy continued to struggle. Contracting manufacturing activity, which had fallen for four successive months, helped fuel the decline."", ""This has driven the valuations of some of China's most popular stocks to multi-year lows. Even after an uptick in Q1, PDD, Alibaba, and Baidu are selling for 25 times, 20 times, and 14 times trailing 12-month earnings, a discount to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500."", ""Tepper's moves may have been wise. Over the past few months, there have been improvements in China's economic prospects. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased 5.3% year over year in Q1, while the manufacturing and services sectors grew by 6% and 5%, respectively."", 'That said, investors should be aware of the additional risk factors that are part of investing in China. The economy is still a wild card, government crackdowns can negatively affect investments, and relations between China and the U.S. are frequently rocky.', ""While Tepper's picks may seem intriguing, investors should merely use this information as a starting point and do their own research to determine if these stocks are a good fit with their investing philosophy and risk tolerance."", ""It's worth noting that Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Alphabet collectively still make up 38% of Tepper's portfolio, so he obviously believes each of these stocks has room to run. However, it's clear from his purchases this quarter that Tepper believes China stocks could have more upside."", 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The association and cast members will discuss improvements to health and safey, wages, benefits, working conditions and job security before meeting with Walt Disney Company representatives about negotiating the staff priorities into a contract, she said.', 'The union already represents theatrical performers at Disney’s Florida parks.', 'Barring any election challenges, the regional director of The National Labor Relations Board will certify the results within a week, the association said.', 'The NLRB did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking confirmation or additional information about the vote.', 'The election took place on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday in Anaheim, California, after workers earlier this year filed cards to form the unit called “Magic United.”', 'Parade and character workers who promoted unionizing said they love helping to create a magical experience at Disneyland but grew concerned when they were asked to resume hugging visitors after returning to work during the coronavirus pandemic.

After all, in today's world, companies pay a premium for your attention. Considering how crowded the streaming realm has become, Netflix has swiftly pivoted once again."", ""While the competition is busy developing new television series with big celebrity names attached, Netflix is doing something different. Let's break down how Netflix is evolving from a run-of-the-mill streaming service to a full-blown entertainment conglomerate."", 'One of the biggest knocks against streaming, in general, is that audiences often have the option to watch an entire television series in one sitting. Although binging content offers some convenience, it often leaves you wanting more -- as you now need something new to watch.', ""Recently, Netflix has made an effort to move into live content. In other words, the platform is releasing content that you can tune into live -- just like real television. While this strategy is in its infancy, early indications are showing that it's resonating with audiences."", 'In early May, Netflix produced a live comedy event called The Roast of Tom Brady.

Disney has built an unparalleled level of brand equity from fans around the world. One of the reasons Disney resonates with fans is that it brings its beloved movies to real life through its theme parks."", ""I think Netflix House is a creative strategy because it will not require the same capital investment as a theme park. At the same time, it helps deepen fans' relationships with Netflix's content by providing them with a way to experience their favorite shows on a new level."", 'The chart below illustrates the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio among some media and entertainment companies.

But at present, Under Armour, founded by a 23-year-old former college athlete, is struggling to “just do it.”', 'Instead, the brand that’s championed on the basketball court by Stephen Curry and on the golf course by Jordan Spieth, is now struggling — badly — to find its footing in an increasingly competitive and crowded sportwear marketplace for regular folks, where younger shoppers are more googly-eyed over newer entrants like Hoka and On running shoes.', 'Under Armour’s annual sales have been sluggish at best for the past several years, while its stock has plunged 88% from its all-time high in 2015. Industry experts said the company is mired in an unpleasant mix of problems, which include an identity crisis, several management controversies, ignoring evolving market trends to its detriment, and a rotating carousel of CEOs in quick succession.', 'One of them is Kevin Plank, its founder, who is back at the helm for a second time as CEO after being replaced in 2019. Similar to Starbucks founder Howard Schultz’s past returns to Starbucks and Disney chief Bob Iger’s recent return as CEO, Plank aims to right the ship at Under Armour.', '“When Under Armour was growing at 20% plus numbers, people saw it as a legitimate competitor to Nike,” said David Swartz, senior equity analyst with research firm Morningstar, in an interview with CNN.', '“It was like On or Hoka but 10 years ago. It was the upstart athletic brand that was making real inroads against Nike, the dominant name in the industry. People saw it as a company that actually could break through and take market share from Nike among the hardcore athletes,” Swartz said. “That actually did happen for a while, but then that didn’t last.”', 'Plank launched Under Armour in 1996 to be what the name suggests — a protective layer of clothing worn by competitive athletes sweating it out in the heat of the game.', 'The first product was a fitted T-shirt called “The Shorty,” made from moisture-wicking fabric for elite athletes to wear under their uniforms to keep them dry. Its iconic Under Armour intertwined “U” and “A” logo was strategically placed on the neckline, to keep it conspicuous.', 'The T-shirt eventually launched the brand to the masses after it quickly gained fandom among the ranks of professional athletes. The startup’s fast track to success led to Under Armour going public in 2005. It’s early slogan: “Protect This House.”', 'By 2010, the business had crossed $1 billion in sales. Five years later, sales surpassed $4 billion. But then the momentum started to wane.', 'The past eight years for Under Armour have been a struggle that doesn’t appear to be abating.', 'The company on Thursday announced a restructuring of its business as its North America sales in its most recent quarter tumbled 10%. Looking ahead, the company cast a dour forecast for its current fiscal year, expecting sales to drop 15% to 17%. Layoffs will be part of the effort to right the ship but executives did not specify how many employees will lose their jobs.', 'Under Armour also announced a $500 million share buyback, a move to reward shareholders.', 'Plank told analysts during the earnings call on Thursday that he will shepherd a reset of the business that centers on selling fewer but more innovative products to meet the needs of athletes, significantly accelerating product development, refocusing on its men’s apparel category and reducing discounts of its products.', '“We are simply doing too much stuff. There are too many products, too many initiatives. To reconstitute this brand, we must be highly focused and prioritize what needs to get done so that our teams know exactly what to do with a clear definition of success for them,” Plank said.', 'It can’t be ignored that management issues, too, have plagued the business for years, Swartz said.', '“The company has essentially had five CEOs in the past five years, if you count Kevin Plank twice,” said Swartz. Plank was announced as CEO — again — in March, ending the very brief year-long tenure of Stephanie Linnartz.', 'Plank conceded during the analysts call Thursday that frequent C-suite turnover had become a serious impediment to success.', '“With several CEOs and heads of product, marketing in North America over the past half-decade, ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive,” he said.', 'The period from 2016 onward is when “things really started to fall apart” at Under Armour, Swartz said. A huge issue arose when an important channel of distribution for the brand went bankrupt and closed stores.', 'A bulk of Under Armour products are sold through sporting goods retailers and department stores, including Macy’s and Kohl’s, and online.', '“When Sports Authority went bankrupt in 2016 it really hurt Under Armour. It was a major customer of the brand, as is Dick’s Sporting Goods,” Schwartz said.', 'In 2020, UCLA sued Under Armour for ending a $280 million sponsorship deal. The suit alleged that Under Armour was struggling before Covid-19 and that it used the pandemic as a reason to get out of the deal.', 'The 15-year sponsorship deal, signed in 2016, was the largest in the history of college sports at the time. In exchange for the $280 million, UCLA’s student athletes and personnel would wear and use Under Armour (UA)-supplied products exclusively. The company reached a settlement with UCLA.', 'The following year, Under Armour paid $9 million to settle a multi-year investigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commission into its past accounting practices, according to Footwear News.', 'Outside of other bad press for Plank, competitors were gaining ground on Under Armour, whose high-performance sportwear offerings weren’t best suited for the Lululemon-driven athleisure trend that had emerged and then dominated the way consumers dressed through the pandemic.', '“Under Armour has failed to latch upon streetwear, or sports style that catapulted On or Hoka or Merrell,” said Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce, with market research firm eMarketer, in an interview with CNN. “It needs to figure out what is next. If it can’t do that, then it needs to quickly latch upon what another brand has identified as the next big thing.”', 'Stambor questioned Plank’s decision to pull back from discounts at a time when consumers are hyper focused on value.', '“It carries the risk of decreasing demand particularly when you don’t have a must-have product,” he said. Stambor said this decision also stands in stark contrast to a recent move that rival Adidas has made to roll out cheaper versions of their must-have shoes.', 'Despite it’s significant challenges, Stambor said Under Armour can remain relevant in the market. “It is a very large company with huge revenue. It’s not as though the brand has fully diminished in standing. It’s a bit stuck,” he said.', '“Under Armour needs to identify what it is that consumers want and lean heavily in that direction. It hasn’t fully shown an ability to do so over the past few years,” he said.', 'One area that’s going strong is the brand’s long-term celebrity-brand partnerships, said Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group, a sports and entertainment firm that evaluates sponsorships and advertising campaigns.', '“Under Armour’s relationship with the ‘The Rock’, Dwayne Johnson, has been pretty effective. They’ve expanded to the United Football League, which is the football league that Johnson co-owns,” Smallwood said. “Their uniforms are Under Armour.”', 'Golf is another area where the brand is making inroads while the Stephen Curry partnership has kept the brand visible in the basketball world, Smallwood said.', 'The basketball superstar Curry, arguably the best shooter in history, famously signed with Under Armour instead of Nike in 2013. Meanwhile, the brand’s other major NBA star, Joel Embiid, quit Under Armour in 2023 a few months after he was named the league’s most valuable player.', 'Embiid signed a shoe deal with Skechers last month. Under Armour reportedly bid hard for a shoe deal with WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark, who many expect will sign with Nike.', '“The bottomline for Under Armour is for the brand to be clear about its identity,” he said. “Are they a shoe company? Are they an apparel company? At one point everyone else copied their mositure-wicking undershirt. Then maybe they had an identity crisis. It’s going to come down to deciding if they want to evolve into a lifestyle brand or stay in performance-based products.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Generative AI has myriad applications, and mega-cap-tech behemoths are leading innovation efforts across the industry.', 'One of the subtle growth opportunities in AI is data centers. In fact, Statista estimates that network infrastructure, storage, and server solutions will be a $439 billion opportunity by 2028.', 'Indeed, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have so far been big beneficiaries in data center-network services. However, smart investors know that there are peripheral opportunities outside of the obvious winners.', ""One AI data center stock that I've been monitoring is Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). Let's break down why Oracle could be a lucrative opportunity for long-term investors as the data center boom continues to unfold."", 'Outside of Nvidia and AMD, a number of other tech businesses are making a splash in the data center realm.', ""Vertiv is a unique opportunity that's been witnessing outsize growth from the rising demand for data center services. Moreover, the company's close ties to Nvidia certainly don't hurt."", ""Furthermore, Amazon recently announced an $11 billion investment to build out additional data center infrastructure. This isn't entirely surprising considering Amazon is a leader among cloud-computing platforms, and the company is developing its own semiconductor training and inferencing chips."", ""Back in March, Oracle announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Feb. 29). On the surface, the company's revenue growth of 7% year over year might appear mundane."", ""However, Oracle reported a number of other key performance indicators outside of traditional financial statements. Perhaps the most important of these metrics was remaining performance obligations (RPO). This is a critical operating metric because it measures a company's backlog, providing investors with a glimpse of future growth."", ""As of the end of Oracle's fiscal Q3, RPO grew 29% year over year to $80 billion -- a record for the company."", 'One of the reasons for such high backlog? Data centers. During the earnings call, Oracle\'s chairman, Larry Ellison, stated that the company ""is building data centers at a record level"".', ""He isn't exaggerating. Just this week, Bloomberg reported that one of Elon Musk's start-ups, xAI, is rumored to be talking to Oracle for a $10 billion deal to rent cloud servers."", 'The potential deal between Oracle and xAI does not make the stock a buy. The deal could fall apart, and there is no guarantee xAI will use Oracle for its cloud solutions.', ""With that said, I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal will come to fruition. Oracle already works with xAI as it pertains to other AI services. Moreover, Larry Ellison and Elon Musk have a well-publicized positive relationship -- so much so that Ellison used to serve on Tesla's Board of Directors."", 'The bigger idea here is that businesses are relying on more than just the legacy hyperscalers of Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia for their AI cloud needs. Whether Oracle closes its deal with xAI, I see the negotiations as a major source of validation that there will be many winners outside of big tech in the AI data center realm.', ""Although Oracle's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.9 isn't exactly dirt cheap, it is far below many of its peers."", 'I think now is a terrific opportunity to begin building a position in Oracle stock. As demand for AI cloud-storage solutions continues to rise, Oracle should see an influx of business from both new and existing customers.', ""The secular trends fueling AI represent a new growth narrative for Oracle, and I see now as a great time to scoop up some shares.

At first, this may sound like a contradiction, given how there are both growth and value camps of investing styles. There are also investment strategies focused primarily on yield, with less consideration of underlying growth or value.', 'However, there are indeed stocks that offer this winning combination for solid long-term total returns. When it comes to yield, your focus shouldn’t necessarily be on the highest-yielding stocks. Plenty of them are best described as yield traps, also known as dividend value traps.', 'Rather, top dividend stocks offer moderately-high yields, but with the potential for dividend growth over time. Speaking of growth, stocks with dividend growth are typically companies with earnings growth potential. This growth also typically translates into long-term price appreciation.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Regarding value, not all stocks with promising growth prospects trade at high valuations. There are names out there that are reasonably or more-than-reasonably priced, that nonetheless offer the prospect of steady growth.', 'Screening for stocks using this criteria, I have come across the following seven best dividend stocks to buy.', 'Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.com', 'At current prices, Citigroup (NYSE:C) has a forward dividend yield of 3.38%. Admittedly, shares in the money center bank have not experienced much in the way of dividend growth over the past few years.', 'In 2023, Citi raised its quarterly payout from 51 cents to 53 cents per share, but prior to that, the last dividend increase had been implemented in 2019. However, given a key catalyst for C stock, a dividend growth spurt may be due. As I recently discussed, an in-progress turnaround may soon result in a big improvement to profitability.', 'Sell side forecasts call for Citigroup to report $7.18 per share in earnings next year. This estimate represents a 22.1% jump from forecasted 2024 earnings. These additional earnings could be key in the next series of dividend increases for the bank. Earnings growth would also likely result in price appreciation for shares.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'There is more than one reason why General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is one of the best dividend stocks to buy. For one, the defense contractor is a “dividend aristocrat,” with a 29-year track record of dividend increases.', 'GD’s forward yield of 1.94% may not sound very high, but the company’s dividend increases have averaged 7.14% annually over the past five years. Besides its dividend growth track record, GD stock is one of the top dividend stocks, thanks to the recession resistant nature of its underlying industry.', 'In fact, as geopolitical conflict intensifies across the globe, spurring demand from the U.S. and its allies, growth prospects are bright. Analyst consensus calls for General Dynamics to grow earnings by nearly 12% next year. If achieved, this growth will be sufficient to sustain recent levels of dividend growth, as well as drive a steady move higher for the stock.', 'Source: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.com', 'Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) has been on a tear, and recent indication of success with its turnaround has fueled the latest rally. During the March quarter, Hasbro reported revenue and earnings that handily beat sell-side expectations.', 'After this post-earnings surge in price, HAS stock is up nearly 20% year-to-date, and has climbed more than 41% higher over the past six months. Yet while this may imply that the Hasbro comeback is already priced-in, I wouldn’t make that assumption. As the turnaround continues, further boosts to earnings may lie ahead.', 'The high end of forecasts for 2025 call for as much as $4.79 per share in annual earnings. This makes HAS reasonably priced at around $61 per share. Turnaround success also suggests that the company will maintain its dividend as is. That means investors can receive a 4.57% yield while they wait for the comeback to fully play out.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/ampersandphoto', 'Lancaster Colony (NASDAQ:LANC) may not be a company you’ve heard of, but chances are you know of at least one of this food purveyor’s branded food products. These products include New York Bakery garlic bread and Marzetti salad dressing.', 'Even if you are not a fan or even aware of these products, it’s hard to dispute that LANC stock isn’t one of the best dividend stocks to buy. With a 60 year dividend growth track record, forget about mere “dividend aristocrat” status, for LANC is a “dividend king.”', 'Shares currently yield 1.83%. Payouts have grown by an average of 6.96% annually for the past five years. Although pricey on paper, at 31.2 times forward earnings, as earnings continue to grow at a high single-digit/low double-digit clip, this valuation is likely sustainable. After a pullback in early April, now may be an opportune time to buy.', 'Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com', 'In prior coverage of top dividend stocks, I’ve talked about Paychex’s (NASDAQ:PAYX) key rival in the payroll processing space: Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). However, PAYX has many of the same dividend growth bona fides as its larger competitor.', 'Although not quite yet at “dividend aristocrat” status, PAYX stock appears to be on the path towards reaching this status. Paychex has increased its payout 9 years in a row, and by an average of 9.68% over the past five years.', 'Shares currently sport a 3.23% forward yield, which is well above ADP’s forward yield of 2.28%. Yes, this gap may have a lot to do with ADP’s higher level of expected earnings growth. However, if you are looking for returns driven more strongly by dividend payouts than price appreciation, between these two solid dividend growth opportunities, PAYX could be your preferred option.', 'Source: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com', 'Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is another of the best dividend stocks to buy that has been performing well lately. Shares in the mobile chip company have hit a new 52-week high, thanks to the reporting of strong quarterly results on May 1.', 'In the release, Qualcomm beat forecasts, as well as provided updates to guidance that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. These latest numbers provide a stronger indication that normalizing device chip demand, plus rising demand for the company’s automotive and AI chips, will lead to further strong results in the quarters ahead.', 'Besides keeping QCOM stock, reasonably priced at 18.2 times forward earnings, on an upward trajectory, earnings growth may also result in further dividend growth. QCOM currently has a forward yield of 1.88%, but the company has raised its payout 20 years in a row and by an average of 5.23% annually over the past five years.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock', 'VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership of casino real estate. This REIT owns the land and buildings housing many of Las Vegas’ legendary casinos, as well as properties housing regional casinos across the U.S. and Canada.', 'With the steady rental income generated from these properties, investors in this house always win. VICI stock today has a forward dividend yield of 5.67%. Since going public in 2017, Vici has raised its payout each year.

That is, most of the best ones are at or near all-time highs. Now's not the optimal time to step in -- particularly if you're planning on stepping in forever."", 'A handful of high-quality S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) dividend stocks have bucked this bigger trend, though, instead peeling back to more palatable prices.', ""One of the top prospects among these names is fast-food chain McDonald's (NYSE: MCD). Shares are only down around 10% from their January peak. However, that may be about as much of a discount as you're going to see from this ticker anytime soon."", ""You know the company. McDonald's is, of course, the planet's biggest restaurant chain, operating a little over 42,000 locations worldwide. Last year, it did nearly $25 billion worth of business, turning $8.5 billion of that into net income. However, McDonald's isn't quite the company you might think it is."", ""Customers neither know nor care, but the company itself doesn't actually own most of its restaurants. Nearly 95% of its locations are run by franchisees, who, for most intents and purposes, are in business for themselves, even if not in business by themselves."", ""As is the case with most franchisor/franchisee relationships, McDonald's operators are required to purchase their supplies from the parent and must adhere to the parent's operating standards. They also pay the parent a portion of their total sales. None of its owners/operators mind this too much, though, since the McDonald's brand is a reliably marketable one."", ""There is one stark difference between the McDonald's franchising agreement and the franchising agreement most other restaurant chains make with their operators, though. That is, these franchisees don't own the land or the building they run their business from. The McDonald's Corporation itself owns it, and charges franchisees rent based on ever-rising prevailing rates. In fact, nearly 40% of its top line reflects rent collected from operators, making it the company's single-biggest source of revenue."", ""No, franchisees don't particularly love the arrangement. Like any other real estate purchase, building up equity in the property and the structure sitting on it is usually one of the benefits of opening any restaurant. McDonald's franchisees don't get to enjoy this benefit."", ""By and large, though, these franchisees understand and accept the trade-off even if they don't like it. McDonald's isn't just the world's biggest restaurant chain, after all. It's also one of the world's most recognized names, while its golden arches are one of its most recognizable logos. The odds of profitable success are much higher with a McDonald's restaurant than they are with other fast-food chains."", ""Numbers crunched by Barron's suggest that the average McDonald's located in the U.S. does nearly $4 million worth of business per year, which is roughly twice that of the typical Wendy's or Burger King."", ""The real winners of the agreement, however, are McDonald's investors -- and, in particular, its dividend-minded shareholders. Just like your own mortgage or rent payments, McDonald's expects to collect its monthly rent payments regardless of the economic backdrop. And, unlike your monthly payment, for anyone with a mortgage, these monthly bills are ratcheted higher on a regular basis."", ""Meanwhile, not only are rising supply costs translating into more revenue for the parent company, but McDonald's has recently raised its royalty rate from 4% to 5% for new operators.What stinks for operators is good news for shareholders, however, as it generates the income that supports McDonald's growing dividend."", 'To this end, the fast-food giant has now upped its annualized dividend payment for 47 years in a row, with the most recent increase being a 10% improvement on its quarterly payment. You can plug into this long string of success while the stock is yielding right around 2.5%.', ""Is it possible something could derail McDonald's dividend track record? Sure. Anything's possible.

As components of the mCRM System, the devices are designed to work together wirelessly to coordinate painless intracardiac anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) therapy, provide rate-responsive bradycardia pacing support and to prevent sudden cardiac death without the risk of leads in the heart or under the sternum. Findings were presented at Heart Rhythm 2024, the annual meeting of the Heart Rhythm Society, and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.', 'In addition to evaluating the safety and performance of the EMPOWER LP as a standalone pacemaker, the trial evaluated the ability of the EMBLEM S-ICD System to successfully communicate a wireless request to the LP to deliver ATP therapy.

The trial enrolled 2,626 PP patients indicated to receive an ICD at 134 centers globally and is the largest head-to-head trial of ATP in this patient group. In the study, patients were randomized 1:1 to standard transvenous-ICD therapy – ATP plus an ICD-delivered shock to terminate a ventricular tachycardia – versus shock only. Across five years of follow up, data demonstrated a statistically significant, but small absolute first all-cause shock reduction in only 1% of patients per year. Shock burden, or the number of shocks experienced by a patient, was not significantly different between the two arms, and the vast majority of patients in the ATP-plus-shock arm did not require ATP therapy.', '""Together, data from the MODULAR ATP and APPRAISE ATP trials reinforce the promise of the groundbreaking mCRM System, illustrating a clear path forward for physicians to offer therapies that prevent sudden cardiac death and deliver ATP for the small number of patients who benefit from it,"" said Kenneth Stein, M.D., senior vice president and global chief medical officer, Boston Scientific.

If you're someone who likes to pick individual stocks, then I'd assume the goal is to try to outperform the S&P 500 over the long term.

"", ""That track record points to the fact that Coca-Cola is a mature business that operates in an industry that won't register growth that much better than the rise of global gross domestic product (GDP)."", ""That's because non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages aren't being consumed in larger quantities on a per-person basis, especially in the U.S. And Coca-Cola already sells its products in more than 200 countries and territories, so there isn't really more room to further penetrate new markets."", ""Coca-Cola's revenue in 2023 was actually slightly lower than what the business reported 10 years before in 2013.

If sales and earnings increased at a higher clip, I'm almost positive the stock would have done much better."", ""The valuation also looks expensive. Trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.3, the stock goes for a premium relative to the S&P 500. That seems off to me, particularly when you realize that you'd have been better off just investing in the broader index in recent times."", ""Coca-Cola might not have the potential to put up strong investment returns going forward.

I'm sure Buffett is familiar with these points."", ""The business possesses one of the world's most powerful brands. This not only results in customer loyalty -- it helps management flex its pricing power. Even better, the brand differentiates Coca-Cola from the large number of rival products on the market."", ""Unlike many companies, especially in the technology sector, Coca-Cola operates in an industry that doesn't invite much in the way of disruption and innovation. And that's a good thing. It means there is a minimal chance Coca-Cola will become irrelevant anytime soon. In other words, the business has durability.

This valuation is significantly higher than the industry average and makes Intuit one of the most expensive tech stocks on the market.', 'Moreover, Intuit’s growth has been slowing down in recent years. While Intuit expects 11-12% revenue growth and 12-14% non-GAAP operating income growth in FY 2024, these rates are lower than the growth rates seen in previous years. The gradual decline in Intuit’s forward revenue growth rate from 23% in FY 2022 to 12% currently raises concerns about the company’s sustainability of growth.', 'Furthermore, INTU’s suite of products faces tough competition in the market. QuickBooks is challenged by smaller, more agile competitors offering similar financial management tools. Mailchimp is losing market share in email marketing to more feature-rich platforms like HubSpot.', 'On the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Mohammed Saqib is a research analyst with experience in equity research and financial modeling.

No, it’s downright boring. In an age where everything seems centered on the latest technological advancements, is there a place for passive income?', 'You bet! Fundamentally, we just don’t know what may lie ahead. Yes, the benchmark S&P 500 index is up around 10% on a year-to-date basis heading into the May 10 session. However, momentum has definitely slowed, with the index gaining just 1% in the trailing month.', 'Given the apparent deceleration in risk-on sentiment, it may be time to consider passive income. With that, here are reliable dividend stocks to buy.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'One of the most recognizable brands in the world, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a powerhouse in the soft drink industry. Since the start of the year, KO stock gained over 5%. However, the positive sentiment has been a more recent affair, with shares gaining nearly 7% in the trailing month. Fundamentally, with pressures being applied to the consumer economy, Coca-Cola could provide a cheaper source of caffeine for American workers.', 'In terms of passive income, Coca-Cola offers a forward dividend yield of 3.09%. That’s well above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. To be fair, the payout ratio is on the elevated side at 64.39%. Still, it’s not horrendous. Further, the most important metric is that the beverage maker commands 63 years of consecutive dividend increases.', 'For the current fiscal year, covering experts believe earnings per share will rise to $2.62 on revenue of $42.49 billion. In the following year, EPS could jump to $2.81 on sales of $44.54 billion. In 2023, the company posted earnings of $2.50 with a top line of $42.5 billion. It’s clearly one of the reliable dividend stocks to buy.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'A utility giant, Sempra (NYSE:SRE) makes a great case for reliable dividend stocks. True, utility firms aren’t exactly the most popular entities among their customers. However, the sector generally enjoys a natural monopoly. Would-be competitors don’t even try due to the high barriers to entry. Also, Sempra leverages a geographic advantage because it covers much of the desirable Southern California market.', 'Sempra is no slouch in the passive income department, offering a forward yield of 3.26%. To be fair, that’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. Still, the aforementioned geographic advantage must be considered. Also, the company benefits from 21 years of consecutive annual payout increases. With a payout ratio of 48.08%, investors don’t have to fret too much about yield sustainability.', 'For fiscal 2024, experts see a bit of a mixed picture. EPS could land at $4.81, an improvement over last year’s result of $4.61. However, revenue might slip 3% to $16.22 billion. Nevertheless, in fiscal 2025, projections call for EPS of $5.16 on sales of $16.99 billion. Thus, SRE makes a great case for reliable dividend stocks to buy.', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'A powerhouse enterprise in the healthcare sector, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) should enjoy some insulation from economic woes. Of course, no enterprise is completely immune to broader pressures. However, when people need medical care, they’re not really thinking about market fluctuations: there are other pressing, literal life-and-death matters at hand. In that sense, JNJ deserves closer consideration for reliable dividend stocks.', 'As for the passive income, JNJ makes a sterling case even without the fundamental narrative. Right now, J&J offers a forward yield of 3.31%. That’s noticeably above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Not only that, the payout ratio is reasonable at 45.25%. And the big one – the company commands 63 years of consecutive dividend increases.', 'For the current fiscal year, analysts are targeting EPS of $9.91 on revenue of $82.18 billion. That’s disappointing compared to last year’s print of $9.92 EPS on sales of $85.16 billion. However, 2025 could bring an improvement to earnings of $10.18 per share on sales of $84.4 billion. With shares down 6% YTD, JNJ could be an interesting relative discount to pick up.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Operating in the broader communication services sector, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) specializes in the telecom category. However, it’s really a powerhouse enterprise that combines myriad businesses. One of the more intriguing could be the theme parks segment. While risky, consumer research indicates that people are still prioritizing travel and new experiences. If so, Comcast could be enticing as a sort of bucket list item.', 'Fundamentally, the company owns the Universal brand, which gives it a wide entertainment canvas. While waiting for the modified revenge travel narrative to play out, investors can bank on the passive income. Currently, Comcast offers a forward yield of 3.22%.', 'Admittedly, this is lower than the communication sector’s average yield of 4.86%. However, the payout ratio is super low at 27.4%. Further, Comcast has enjoyed 17 years of consecutive dividend increases.', 'Fiscal 2024 projections call for a rather modest print of EPS of $4.22 on revenue of $123.98 billion. Last year, the company posted earnings of $3.98 per share on sales of $121.57 billion. Still, its average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters stands at 10.4%, implying resilience. It’s one of the reliable dividend stocks to consider.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'A legacy technology juggernaut, IBM (NYSE:IBM) often gets overlooked when it comes to innovative publicly traded ideas. Its most recent performance hasn’t really helped. After getting off to a strong start, IBM stock is up only 3% since the start of the year. Still, I think “Big Blue” deserves respect for returning stakeholders over 36% of equity value in the past 52 weeks.', 'Moving forward, IBM offers myriad relevancies in areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. It was one of the pioneers in the digital intelligence ecosystem. Therefore, the company could be an underappreciated example of reliable dividend stocks to consider.', 'At the moment, the tech firm offers a forward yield of 4.02%. That’s well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. In fairness, the payout ratio is elevated at 63.85%. However, it’s not the worst ratio. And any concerns will likely be mitigated by the history of 29 years of consecutive payout increases.', 'As a warning, Big Blue will require big patience. In fiscal 2024, EPS could fall to $9.23 on sales of $58.64 billion. Last year, the print stood at $9.62 EPS on sales of $61.86 billion. However, the consistent growth in the bottom line over the past four quarters may force a positive rethink.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'A tobacco giant, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) is understandably a controversial enterprise. It also might raise eyebrows for good reason. Globally, smoking prevalence rates have declined. That’s thanks to consistent anti-tobacco advocacy groups warning about the dangers of smoking and nicotine addiction. However, the underlying practice has shifted to the digital realm through vaporizers and e-cigarettes.', 'That could benefit a tobacco stalwart like Philip Morris because it can crush the competition. Essentially, many of the popular vaporizers have been developed by smaller enterprises. However, government action aimed at cracking down on flavored vaporizers have impeded many small businesses and these measures may find adoption in the international markets which Philip Morris serves.', 'Cynically, this dynamic may give a boost to big tobacco. While waiting for this narrative to materialize, investors can enjoy a stout forward dividend yield of 5.23%. Yes, it’s fair to point out that the payout ratio is high at 75.22%. However, the company also carries 16 years of consecutive dividend increases, a metric it won’t give up cheaply.', 'Analysts also peg shares a consensus moderate buy with a high-side price target of $118. Thus, it makes for a tempting case for reliable dividend stocks to buy.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com', 'No matter how much the ideological winds scream at the hydrocarbon industry, the world runs on oil. Maybe that will change at some point. For now, it’s the harsh reality and that cynically benefits Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI). Known as a midstream operator, Kinder Morgan specializes in the storage and transportation of petroleum-based goods.', 'Irrespective of whatever lies ahead in the economy – aside from absurdly extreme forecasts of Armageddon – people need midstream operators. That’s even more the case because of the fallout in the electric-vehicle space. Rather than pivoting aggressively to EVs, consumers have gravitated toward hybrid vehicles. Hybrids are combustion-powered, which means that midstream operators should see a relevance boost.', 'For passive income, Kinder Morgan offers a forward dividend yield of 6.05%. That’s well above the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%, which is already high. Admittedly, the payout ratio is very high at 92.11%. Still, the company carries seven consecutive years of payout increases.', 'For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate strong growth of 13.1% in the top line to $17.14 billion. And by fiscal 2025, revenue could rise to $17.91 billion, with a blue-sky target of $21.11 billion. It’s one of the reliable dividend stocks to put on your radar.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
