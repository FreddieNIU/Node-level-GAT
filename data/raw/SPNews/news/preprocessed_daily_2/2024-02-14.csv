Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So, when we ran our eye over Nucor's (NYSE:NUE) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Nucor:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.20 = US$6.2b ÷ (US$35b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, Nucor has an ROCE of 20%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.9% earned by companies in a similar industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Nucor ', ""In the above chart we have measured Nucor's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Nucor."", ""We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Nucor. The company has consistently earned 20% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 103% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models."", ""In short, we'd argue Nucor has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 249% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research."", ""One final note, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Nucor (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) ."", ""If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here."", 'Have feedback on this article?

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'Nucor is expected to post earnings of $3.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -23.4%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nucor is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'For Nucor, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.13 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -6.7%.

The EPS surprise was +11.66%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.', 'Valuation', ""Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Nucor is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

Revenue in the December quarter was within our guided range of flat sequentially. During the December quarter, we had two customers that each made up greater than 10% of our reported revenue. Export related sales accounted for the top five customers and seven out of the top 10 customers. Our top 10 customers made up 58% of revenue. Our top 25 customers made up 74% of revenue in terms of regional sales, three of our top 10 customers were Asia-based. Our top 36 customers made up 80% of our revenue, with 40% of our sales coming from Asia, followed by 47% of our sales coming from North America and 13% of our sales coming from Europe. Finally, our top two customers were Asia and US-based customers respectively, and collectively made up 30% of sales last year, we commented that the buildup in channel inventory, particularly at our WiFi customers in the Asia region, would adversely impact our revenue in the second half of calendar 2023 our revenue met our guided targets for September and December quarters. Today, we believe we have worked through the inventory issues from 2023, and we expect demand returning in WiFi with strength in WiFi 6E and first production demand in WiFi seven, consistent with our early guidance for fiscal Q3 on last quarter's investor call, we reiterate our expectation to return to record quarterly revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, up 18% to 25% sequentially. The Company continues to focus on expense and cost savings to significantly reduce cash burn. Moving forward. Ken will detail our ongoing activities and impact on reducing our cash burn during his upcoming comments. I would now like to take a moment to discuss updates involving the Company's activity related to the chips and science Act of 2022. Regarding CHIPS Act funding, there are two detailed updates to share with investors. First, during the December quarter, we became members of three microelectronics. Any comments, hubs focused on electronic warfare for the Department of Defense. Membership to these hubs is critical as it allows access to be part of the hub proposal team for new government research programs. We currently have two active EW. proposals under one hub membership with one of the proposals potentially worth several million dollars annually beginning in the second half of calendar year 2024. Furthermore, we are currently pursuing memberships with additional ME hub centers, and we'll detail our efforts and progress moving forward. Second, the CHIPS Act of 2022 included a provision for a 25% refundable investment tax credit for chips, ITC., our investments in facilities that manufacture semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment that were placed in service after December 31, 2022. We currently estimate the amount of the refundable tax credit applicable to acoustics to be $3.7 million to $4.7 million over the next 12 to 15 months. Next, I would like to discuss several updates in our primary target markets beginning with WiFi. Our first milestone for the December quarter in Y. five was to receive a design win in a next-generation WiFi seven solution with a Tier one US-based carrier. Our carrier partner has awarded us design wins for two high band XBAR filters for WiFi seven. Further, we received prototype orders to support a production ramp in the second half of calendar year 2024. Our second milestone was to secure multiple design wins for our Tier one enterprise class customers, WiFi seven suite of routers. We announced this design win last week along with visibility on volume orders to support the production ramp. We support this new platform with a suite of advanced filters covering both wideband and narrowband solutions. Also, our first mass produced aluminum Scandia nitride single crystal ball filter is to be qualified for production for this customer's application. Our third milestone was to secure a design win for a WiFi seven solution with a Tier one enterprise class OEM. We announced this completion of this milestone in our January 10th press release. This customer as our second tier one customer to adopt multiple wideband and narrowband solutions covering five gigahertz and six gigahertz WiFi seven for a four-by-four multi-user MIMO AP platform, we received prototype orders to support a production ramp, which is slated to begin in the second half of calendar year 2024. Looking ahead, in the March quarter, we expect to ramp XBAR filter production for two programs in WiFi seven at a Tier one enterprise class customer. In addition, we expect to ramp XBAR filter production for WiFi seven with a Tier one enterprise class two OEMs, and we expect to secure a design win for a WiFi seven solution with a Tier one enterprise class OEM. Next, I would like to discuss our recent developments in the 5G mobile market. During the December quarter, we recognized filter sales, which incorporated our WLP. package to our Tier one RF component customer. This customer was a top 10 customer on a revenue basis. Also in the December quarter, we expected to deliver. First, the free WiFi filters two are Tier two 5G mobile RF front end module making customers we have contracted with this customer for three filters. We shipped the first of three filters. The second filter is releasing to the fab this month, and the third filter is currently in the design phase of the process. Finally, we successfully engaged a fifth mobile partner offering our export process and foundry for their module and discrete product needs. We have shipped this partner multiple X Bob Dye for engineering evaluation for a future multiplexer application for the mobile market. Our anticipated milestones for the March quarter include delivered the second of three revised WiFi filters to our Tier two 5G mobile RF front end module making customers. And now I will discuss our progress in our network infrastructure business. During the December quarter, we completed the redesign of our new and improved 5G band 41 and five GUS. 3.8 gigahertz network infrastructure filter solutions. We successfully sampled the band 41 filter earlier this month, and we currently are evaluating the performance of our 3.8 gigahertz filter in engineering as we prepare for sampling during the quarter, we experienced softness in export filter shipments to our 5G network infrastructure customers. However, we expect modest growth of shipments to return in the March quarter. For the March quarter, we expect to secure a foundry order for development of up to 4G, 5G. four GLTEXBOWLP. die with a Tier one Satcom provider. Second, we expect to gain approved supplier status and achieve a design win with a Tier one infrastructure customer and finally, we expect to complete in our redevelopment and deliver and in one of four samples to a Tier one network infrastructure customer. Finally, before handing the call off to Ken, I would like to provide an update on our defense and other markets business. During the December quarter, two out of our top 10 customers were in our defense and other business category, and I will begin with an update on our published milestones for the quarter. First, as we announced on January 29, we secured a ball filter design win for an automotive wireless battery management system, or WBMS. solution using a Tier one IC reference design. We expect a production ramp in the March quarter of calendar 2025 second, we completed the qualification of the Optimiz second export resonator for key customer and the timing control market. Now that this qualification is complete, the design is released for limited production resonator is used in a tunable oscillator application scheduled for production in the second half of calendar 2024. Third, we delivered our first Xpand ball filter using acoustics as advanced XP three S. technology to a Tier one defense customer. We met with this customer last month and received positive feedback and expect this engagement to continue for expand phased array radar applications. As previously mentioned, our biggest success in the defense and other market segments, what's the introduction of our new XP. three f. technology, which incorporates a new revolutionary patented multilayer nano material that incorporates our single crystal PAs electric materials. This new nanomaterial was developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or data to scale the export technology to frequencies up to 18 gigahertz. During the December quarter, we began work on our multi-million dollar Phase two contract option, which extends our current dark coffee program and funding through December 2024. During the December quarter, we continued shipments supporting a new Dorper contract unrelated to the DARPin coffee contract, which requires high performance, custom resonators for timing control applications. This customer was a top 10 customer for the December quarter. In addition, we submitted a proposal on a new multimillion dollar program with the Office of Naval Research to fund RF filter multiplexers incorporating our XPO. and P. three f. materials technology, which, if awarded could be announced as early as Q2 of calendar 2024 began in summer 2024 in our GDSI. business. We service 148 customers during the December quarter and the average customer spend is up approximately 17% over the same quarter last year. As mentioned earlier, cruises has established memberships with three regional hubs and GDSI. has at least five additional applications pending with remaining HUB, which we expect to convert to memberships by Q2 of calendar 2024. One key customer milestone for the quarter was the successful completion of a supplier quality audit for an FDA approved diagnostic chip aimed at real-time PCR results. Finally, GDS., I saw a double digit increase in new quoting activity over the prior quarter, which we will push to convert to new orders to grow the business for the March quarter. In the defense and other market segment, we are expecting to deliver the new XBOPDK. to two customers for ongoing foundry engagements and complete the design and sample of a new 2.4 gigahertz WiFi CPE. automotive XBAR filter to multiple customers. And now I would like to hand the call over to Ken to go through our financial highlights."", 'Thank you, Jeff. For the second quarter ended December 31, 2023, Company reported revenue of $7 million, which is in line with our prior guidance and flat over the prior quarter ending September 30, 2023. However, this represents an increase of 20% year over year. On a GAAP basis, operating loss was $15 million for the December quarter, driven by revenue of $7 million, offset by labor costs of $8 million. Depreciation and amortization of $3.2 million and other operational costs totaling $10.8 million. It is noteworthy that our labor and other operating costs have declined sequentially as a result, GAAP net loss per share was $0.21. Capex spending for Q2 was $1.6 million, completing our New York fab tool capacity expansion project to $500 million filters per year. Cash used in operating activities was $11.3 million, which included additional payroll costs associated with our expense reduction efforts, increased legal costs and increased AR and other which we converted to cash in the March quarter. The inventory channel buildup in WiFi is behind us, and we continue to receive design wins and introduce new products as a result we have backlog to support a return to record quarterly revenue in the March quarter with quarterly sales expected to be up 18% or 25%. On the expense front, we have undertaken aggressive expense reduction and cost-saving measures that we estimate will reduce our operating cash flow burn rate by 30% to 38% sequentially in the March quarter. Furthermore, with the expense reductions and cost-saving actions in place, we expect that operating cash burn will drop another 30% to 40% in the June quarter. Given the top line projections, the chips ITC refunds and full impact of recent cost savings. We continue to expect operating cash flow breakeven later this year in the December quarter. The Company sits with a strong balance sheet after the recent completion of $11.5 million underwritten common stock offering announced in late January. And I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for his closing comment.', 'Thank you, Ken. And the market opportunity for our patented high-frequency Expo and XP. three S filters continues to be substantial. We currently have approximately 189 issued patents and patents pending providing a substantial IP moat around our technology. We continue to work aggressively to achieve each of our stated objectives, and we will continue to provide updates on our execution against these objectives as we progress, I want to emphasize to investors that management continues to focus on improving our income statements. As per our guidance, we expect to achieve record quarterly revenues in the March quarter. We are diligently pursuing product cost savings to lower operating expenses and improve gross margin. We have undertaken necessary steps to reduce our operating cash burn in the coming quarters. We believe this is prudent in the economic environment that we are facing further, I appreciate our employees for their hard work, passion and dedication in working together to position our Company for growth in the quarters ahead. Finally, I also wish to thank our shareholders who continue to support the company. And with that, I would like to open the call for questions from the investment community. Operator, please go ahead with the first question.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue, you may press star two, if you would like three mills. Your question from the queue For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question is from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed.', 'Anthony Joseph Stoss', 'Morning, guys. Nice progress on. Maybe maybe for Ken. Can you talk about your, I guess, the new revenue per quarter for breakeven in Q4, what you think gross margins might be in that quarter to get you to breakeven? And also maybe just kind of lay out a linear what you expect OpEx each quarter throughout the year?', 'David Aichele', ""Warren, turning on the comment about revenue for operating cash flow breakeven. I will say that we had a significant expense reductions starting in the September, October timeframe, and we continue to do so. Tom, we had about $14 million annualized reductions. Now we have additional cost savings that pushed those reductions above $20 million annualized. So that also somewhat brings down the need for the gross margin and the revenue in the quarter of operating cash flow breakeven. But I still predict that to be in the end come down a little bit, but the $11 million to $15 million range per quarter of revenue to achieve operating cash flow breakeven, and that would also assume a margin of 20% to 25% in that quarter. And on the OpEx side, I think you touched on that as well. Those numbers have have come down and they are going to continue to come down as well. I predict our operating expense line on our GAAP financial statements will be more in the range of about $10 million per quarter. By the time we get a full a full quarter of annualized savings. And then we get operating cash flow breakeven down. And we talked about the we talked about some margin improvements and as well, we are undertaking a number of measures internally to improve our margins we are on it. We're focusing on some of our existing parks where we have high land costs, some of the some of those costs we can bring down on the laminate side as much as half of what it currently is. We also are introducing a number of new products. We have about 17 products in production currently. That number is going out and we're not going to more than double that next year. So we're introducing more products and all those products have a lower on a lower cost structure to them, particularly on the on the back-end side as they're smaller form factor. And I think I answered all your questions, so I'm just to let me know, and I'll come back on. No no, I think you hit them all. And then, Jeff, I'd love to hear your views."", 'Anthony Joseph Stoss', ""It sounds like inventory on the WiFi is now normalized and maybe from a design perspective, what you see and if you're going to double your products going into next year, what do you think about design activity or number of wins."", 'David Aichele', ""In terms of the fan case in terms of you touched on several things. Let me start with the WiFi inventory. I think we emphasized that in the prepared comments we have we have seen that we started seeing that lift and with our auditors as well as some ongoing design wins. And we started seeing that back in the October, November timeframe. And then that's why we were comfortable kind of providing the guidance back to growth and record quarterly revenue in terms of just estimated, we will provide in the prepared comments of what we expect milestones, at least over the next quarter, you could see additional design wins there, but time in terms of number of design wins over there."", 'Anthony Joseph Stoss', 'And then the next year, I mean, let me ask Dave to kind of touch base continues to go closer to the customer.', 'David Aichele', ""Good morning. Tied a couple of comments I'll make just following up on Joe's statements. The two wireline seven design wins that we just announced and those are in enterprise class programs. And there are some custom filters that we've done for these these two customers and they will turn into standard products that we're going to market to the rest of the industry as well. The dollar content in these are almost two times what we have with WiFi 6E programs. So I think that's significant and that's what we're trying to track now is significant design wins that will see an appreciable revenue in addition to the other design win we announced with the deal, the WiFi 6E program, which is more of a consumer base. The volumes on that are good at a lot of these are with the new products that Ken mentioned that were that release the two that I get the most traction right now that we expect to see multiple design wins per quarter with 1.7. Now that certification is approved and moving forward. And there's a lot of momentum. There was some slowdown last year on WiFi 6E transition into WiFi seven. So we see that picking up in these two products these two parts are in a small form factor that's going to service the 5.5 and 6.5 gigahertz. We also have some investments that we're making on 2.4 gigahertz as well so that we can bundle the all three we focused mainly on high-frequency, but deal, recognizing that we do have demand done at lower frequency as well we can service that. So we expect this momentum to be pretty strong through 2024 calendar year of Wi-Fi seven, and you can expect us to make every quarter announcements on new design wins and giving guidance on when this protective ramps Safety National, my cash fixed, I think it has yet to."", 'Operator', 'My next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed.', 'Craig Andrew Ellis', ""Yes, thanks so much for taking the questions and guys, congratulations on getting the cost structure down and moving closer to cash flow breakeven. I wanted to start with a follow up to the prior question. So it seems from the prepared remarks and the comments just provided in Q&A that a lot of the momentum in Y-FI is around enterprise products. And so I was hoping to get some further color on what you're seeing on the consumer side and how you would expect the mix pick up consumer and enterprise to play out as we go through this year at Morococha."", 'David Aichele', ""So I'll take that question. Yes. The a lot of our activity has been with the enterprise and the volume system volumes are not as high in the hundreds of thousands. But as I commented earlier, the dollar content is pretty significant with these, particularly when you're looking at filters that can range in the 20 to 30 per system. And we've got a leading position here and that we're enabling these systems based on our product portfolio of narrowband and wideband. So that's that's good to continue to increase our customer base there. And it's usually pretty sticky once you have a customer in this sector and you maintain a good customer intimacy and technical support, you will continue to support the new design wins of the one market segment. A dimension, though is pretty strong for us also is the carrier side and we just did a press release yesterday, and that was for WiFi seven program that we got designed into. And if you look at that press release, it lists the six subscriber base that they have up to $32 million. So that those type of volumes that we see on the carrier side, Vocollect voice accumulated by seven, it's about competitive to the type of volume we see on the consumer side. And then the press release we did several months several weeks ago was for a consumer grade. So we are starting to penetrate the consumer grade. That's been a lower priority just based on it is usually more price sensitive and they go after older technology. But we're seeing that as those architectures go into higher volume will come and also with the requirements of WiFi seven due to latency and the channel bandwidth that the higher performance of both filters and the smaller form factor is more critical So their negotiations on price is less important. It's more on performance."", ""And Craig, this is Jeff. I just wanted to follow on maybe summarize the white segment. One of the things I wanted to make sure we had it in here was just some of the momentum in the defense and other markets, and that's really been driven by what's going on and not only with our success in the coffee program. I think we mentioned in the prepared comments and not only starting up the Phase two, but there's definitely a follow-on activity to that at the systems level, and we alluded in the prepared comments on the momentum in the contract. That also is supported by these research hubs that are in place. But we have proposals in place. We're pretty bullish on being able to secure funding a follow-on funding for the EXP. three f. technology, which, as you know, allows us to access much higher frequencies."", 'Craig Andrew Ellis', ""And that's real helpful color, guys. And then the follow-up is for Ken, and it's really just a clarification on two things. The first one related to those comments Ken, as we think about sequential revenue growth in fiscal 3Q, it would seem that it stacks up as being significantly led by enterprise WiFi followed by defense. And then networking is that the case? And then can you just clarify what the what the CapEx outlook is for calendar '24? And to the extent there's any linearity profile that you can share that would be helpful to think"", ""Circa and I'll spend a little bit on CapEx spend. So we've been mentioning over the past few quarters that we're completing our $500 million filter capacity expansion that has been completed. We are now we have that capacity. Certainly we talk about operating cash flow breakeven and the revenues needed. That capacity is well beyond what that revenue is. We do not anticipate a real material spending CapEx for the remainder of calendar year 2024. There are a few older projects that we'll finish there. Are few CapEx items that just come across on everyday business as machines hopefully bring down and we need a new smaller footprint, a bit like an analyzer, something that's worth, but I anticipate CapEx spend for the remainder of the year to be to be in the hundreds of thousands per quarter or less."", 'David Aichele', ""And then I guess kind of to your question on the Q3 revenue. I'm just trying to give you visibility on that where you're a good strong backlog to that, and that's why you've seen the guidance being in that between 25%. And the good news is that the slowdown we saw and we talked about the inventories under control. We started to see that tick back up on some of the legacy WiFi 6E programs as they transition to the WiFi seven program. So one example is our enterprise tier one customer that we've announced in the past. Their volumes are picking back up on the WiFi 6E, and we're already starting to get appreciable flat five seven preproduction orders that were ramping. And then the same thing with the carrier WiFi 6E program it was ticked up from reductions in their inventories. So that demand is going on as they transition into electronic seven. So that's two examples as we also have other customers picking up an introduction and the WiFi seven, we're starting to see significant pull one or two new products. So there's a lot of good activity there. The network side has slowed down the if you look at 5G, overall, Nokia Ericsson and others in that sector have had a poor quarter with quarterly earnings. And so that has slowed down the 5G deployments. So there's still some demand on the small cells, and that's going to be a less of a factor this quarter and next quarter, we expect it to pick up deal with obviously the current products, but also some of the engagements that we made in the and in the period reported."", 'Craig Andrew Ellis', ""That's real helpful. And then just finally, can you mentioned AR would improve in the fiscal third quarter. Do you expect that to fully normalize or does that play out through the fiscal second half of the year? Thank you."", ""And so we on at the end of December, we had some AR buildup on our balance sheet that was due to a lot of year end orders that shipped out towards the end of December that we will collect in this quarter, Q3, there were also some handsome, some some timing issues, particularly with a large program that we have on the energy side with the government and that some we can we can build them and receive money is as according to a set schedule. So that's a that's also in our other receivables, other assets section. And we'll collect that in this quarter as well. And I expect that to normalize out throughout the remainder of the year. Got it. Thanks, guys."", 'Operator', 'And our next question is from Suji Desilva with ROTH MKM. Please proceed.', 'Suji Desilva', ""Good morning, Jeff, Dave and Ken, and congrats on the progress here. Maybe a longer-term question, Jeff, I'm giving you have multiple segments that seem to have some opportunity here and promise. What do you think in a year or two? Are the larger sort of segment contributors? I mean, I would think would be mobile, but the defense program sounds like with these hub memberships, they could be signaling as well as any kind of qualitative thoughts there would be helpful."", ""Yes. If you look at when you look at activity. Others certainly in the I think we've outlined quite a bit from WiFi 6E to one five seven, how you see not only the content increase. Dave touched on the wideband narrowband of portfolio that we have. The other thing that maybe didn't come through but is the SPVASP.s and the WiFi seven. And that's a fact that's favorable for us. So we're kind of mixing into new platforms, which certainly have starting ASPs that are higher. So we're very bullish with the content and Dave outline of two to four times of additional content. And so we're pretty excited about that. If you look over in the defense segment, David indicated it had slowed down and we do see that picking up through through the year. So while it's small and we do expect that business to roughly triple over the the next year, if I kind of look at some of the internal modeling on some lifetime. We expect very strong performance there on that. Defense is on the defense side, several several without contract programs. And we mentioned in the prepared comments that we would be expecting if awarded at least one of those contracts to begin mid-year. And now we continue on with the Phase two data and then that helps us fund some additional activity in the foundry. So that strong and also some of the new spin programs that have come there. And you mentioned mobile, as I'll touch on then, Tom, we have been addressing. We've got a ton of foundry activity ongoing there where we're providing filters for a fully integrated solutions. We'll see how that plays out, Tom, but we've been we mentioned in prepared comments that we shipped the first filter. There's two additional filters that are in the design and fabrication phase, so that can be a contributor. What I what I will say, though, kind of overarching is if you look at the model that we're chart, we're charging to the mobile would be upside to the model that we're projecting for the full year. And so as we talk about Tom, getting to cash flow breakeven at the end of the year, and we do expect that cash flow to be a little lumpy. I go through the year because we've got IDC credits and the timing of those. Ken mentioned some of the timing challenges, but overall on the model would be upside to the plan and with strong performance in defense was five, as well as some on network on a on a percentage growth basis."", 'Suji Desilva', ""Jeff, that's very helpful color on what's embedded in your expectations your second questions on the I guess the new single crystal product you're sampling and just understand the competitive landscape again, and whether the single crystal products expands your competitive advantage is that the color there and whether that opens up markets or whether it's kind of continuous across the products you're doing to that new ones?"", ""So yes, I'll start with that. And then I guess, Dave, to kind of follow in, but the message is that we mentioned that's going into a new one, one five seven a design, and we're utilizing that to obtain some performance enhancements that we think are differentiated. It is amongst the the narrowband designs that we're selling. Again, just to remind you, of the WiFi seven incorporates both wideband and narrowband, we have multiple narrowband custom designs, which there really are no second source for. So we're not having to compete with second source on those. And so that helps us with our bundling activities. So that's in terms of the single crystal maybe gave. Was that anything else there?"", 'David Aichele', ""Suji, no comment. The two things really the single crystal, the development that we do for last couple of years from now to introduce yourself in with the aluminum nitride has enabled us to really service the narrowband and wideband filters for certain market segments. So the recent press that gives us some advantages on power handling deal with some of these applications where you've got this really steep rejection and a narrow transition window. Also, we've seen some improvement in Harmonix, which are critical for some of these coaches type applications. The other thing is it's a building block of our XP. three up, which again is a unique feature of the business and the technical community recognizes that and that this is a manufacturing process with this multilayered and immaterial compared to other technologies that doctors funding. So it's gaining pretty significant interest from the defense industry base, but also well from the 5G sector that's looking at or I should say the cellular sector that's looking at 64 FR. three and then also the satcom market. So the same principles to good building block for discrete devices and also for these high performance technologies like the XP. three f."", 'Suji Desilva', 'Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Jeff. And my last question is just an update again on that the litigation curve would be helpful.', ""Thanks. Thank you, Suky. I'll take that one. Regarding the lawsuit Qorvo fight against acoustics in Delaware. The case has reached a point where I can share acoustics. If you look at the facts, do not support the wide-ranging allegations made by Carlo acoustics acoustics filed a motion for partial summary judgment from February first. And if granted in full this merchant, this motion would dispense with the majority of Qorvo's complaints, everything but the patent claims, but I'll add that the company is well positioned on the patent claims. As mentioned in prior calls, the Company has developed design updates to demonstrate with real world data that export filters do not use Qorvo's patents and motion. We filed also asked the court to confirm that these designs do not infringe one of the two Qorvo patents that issue the other Qorvo patent expires this summer. Cruises also believes cause damages, experts use faulty methods and assumptions to develop key parts of Qorvo's estimate of damages accrued. This has filed a motion to exclude that testimony. This motion represents an additional challenge to key parts of Qorvo's claims. Please keep in mind, even if the court ultimately does not grant acoustic sales motions the defects in Qorvo's case will remain hurdles Qorvo would have to overcome any trial. Qorvo has filed its own motion for partial summary judgment, but this motion is limited to a ruling on the validity of Qorvo patents, no matter the outcome of the Malian corporate will still bear the burden of providing acoustic products approving acoustic products and French corporate patents, notwithstanding all the engineering performed by Houston's supported defense in the case. Now turning to the lawsuit filed by acoustic gets Qorvo in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas cases, beginning to gather steam. As a reminder, this lawsuit alleges Qorvo is infringing a patent licensing exclusively to acoustics by Cornell University. As described in past calls, Qorvo has filed a motion to dismiss the case that morning and have a motion to strike acoustic infringement infringement contentions Akorn held a hearing on the motion to strike on January 10, 2024 after the hearing both sides are after hearing both sides, the court denied Qorvo's motion to strike as a result of this code. This case is moving forward at full steam."", 'Suji Desilva', 'Okay. Thanks for that detail that Asia has to do.', 'Operator', 'We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.', ""Yes. So this is Jeff. I wanted to thank everybody for your time today. I did want to point out that one one, not a typo that we had in the prepared comments was we actually sampled the 3.8 gigahertz and ship samples of that 3.8 gigahertz, and that was not the band 41. So I just want to clarify that before we end the call, I would say we look forward to speaking with you during our next update call to discuss the current quarter's execution against our milestones that we discussed today as well as future expectations.

IMARC Group anticipates substantial growth, projecting the market to reach $169.8 billion by 2032. This forecast indicates a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.1% during the period from 2024 to 2032. The robotics market's expansion is attributed to significant technological advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, a surge in demand for automation due to increasing labor shortages and rising labor costs, government initiatives and funding, and the expanding application areas of robotics."", 'The adoption of robotics has, in fact, doubled in the last six years, setting the stage for further acceleration. According to a 2022 report by the International Federation of Robotics, at least 3.5 million industrial robots were operational in manufacturing factories worldwide as of 2021, and industrial robot installations reached an all-time high. The investment in industrial robots has been on an upward trajectory since 2010, driven by manufacturers aiming to reduce production costs. Recent developments indicate that the impact of robotics is poised to extend beyond manufacturing into different industries. Notably, in the health sciences and wellness sector, robots are increasingly being deployed in operating rooms, clinical settings, and research laboratories to automate manual, repetitive, and high-volume tasks. With evolving technologies, robots are expected to operate more autonomously, eventually performing certain tasks entirely on their own.', 'The high capital expenditure and retraining costs associated with automation through robotics have historically limited efficiency gains to larger companies. However, this scenario is changing, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The average price of an industrial robot has decreased by half over the last decade, dropping from $47,000 in 2011 to approximately $23,000 in 2022. Forecasts by ARK Invest suggest a further 50% to 60% reduction in costs by 2025. Moreover, new business models, such as robotics-as-a-service, are enhancing accessibility by mitigating upfront capex costs through lease agreements.\xa0', 'The past five years, marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, have underscored the vulnerability of globalized supply chains, especially for businesses relying on intricate components like semiconductors. In response, a significant number of European (74%) and US (70%) businesses intend to reshore or nearshore their operations, as indicated by a 2022 survey by ABB Robotics. A substantial portion of these businesses (75% in Europe and 62% in the US) plan to invest in robotic automation within the next three years. Legislative acts like the US CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act further signify the trend toward reshoring manufacturing, either through incentives or mandates. Amid widely reported labor shortages, particularly in manufacturing, there is a clear opportunity for automation and robotics. China, aggressively pursuing robotics in the last decade, surpassed the US in technology adoption in 2021, illustrating the impact of this trend.', 'Bill Gates discussed some groundbreaking robotics initiatives in a GatesNotes blog post at the beginning of 2024. The Microsoft co-founder considers developing machines that mimic human body functions, such as walking, jumping, touching, and gripping objects, to be a greater challenge than advancing artificial intelligence, which already demonstrates daily progress. Gates highlighted his enthusiasm for five robotics startups, starting with Agility Robotics, an American startup that has developed a human-centric, multipurpose robot tailored for logistics work. This robot, approximately the size of a human, can handle heavy loads and express ""emotions"" through LEDs on its face, enhancing interaction with human colleagues. Another notable initiative is from Tevel, an Israeli startup deploying autonomous flying robots for continuous selective fruit picking, ensuring ripe apples are harvested around the clock. Gates also mentioned Apptronik, whose robots have the potential to assist astronauts on Moon or Mars missions. Gates also praised the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory (RoMeLa) at UCLA for its robot capable of navigating rocky, unstable terrain without falling. Lastly, he acknowledged Field AI, a company developing AI-powered software for robots, enabling complete autonomy in various missions. Gates envisions robots, including humanoid models, playing crucial roles in responding to future natural disasters or major health crises like the Covid-19 pandemic.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.', ""The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate."", 'Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Cintas basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Cintas, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.5%.', 'Bottom Line', ""Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term."", 'You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>', 'The upgrade of Cintas to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MGM Resorts achieved outstanding results in 2023, delivering all-time high adjusted property EBITDAR in Las Vegas and in MGM China. Notably, 7 of our domestic properties set individual records for adjusted property EBITDAR for the full year. These outstanding accomplishments underscore the resilience and the agility of our team in navigating a complex operating year. In fact, our employee earned record NPS scores from our customers throughout 2023. I want to thank all of our dedicated employees who constantly strive to deliver on world-class service to our guests. The strength and resiliency of Las Vegas market has been particularly impressive. Strategically, you've heard me talk a lot last year about the evolution of Las Vegas as the new sports and entertainment capital of the world. You saw that fact proven out again Sunday as the city proudly hosted Super Bowl LVIII right in our own backyard. The game was another strong hotel and casino event for us with ADRs near $1,000 and posting 3 of the top 5 room revenue days ever recorded, and near-record event gaming volumes. The game weekend is typically a strong event for MGM Resorts but having the game in town amplified those results dramatically. The game on Sunday followed our inaugural Formula 1 race in November, which was also an incredible success as the largest city event in our history. Additionally, we gleaned valuable insights from the event and specifically on how to better price and program all of our resorts and streamline the preparation work for future years. With both F1 and Super Bowl, our brand was on full display. Our proximity to the Legion Stadium, the F1 track and, of course, T-Mobile Arena afford us the opportunity to expand our reach during these citywide events. We also have officially launched our partnership with Marriott with impressive early results. Marriott Bonvoy customers can now seamlessly book rooms at select MGM properties in Las Vegas with 16 brands set to be introduced by the end of Q1. In Macau, we ended 2023 with an all-time record adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter and the full year. Our robust market share was comfortably in the mid-teens and continued its upward trend in January. The strategic addition of 200 table games, coupled with the agile operations of our team and the reinvestment into many amenities, have collectively driven these exceptional results. In digital, BetMGM made its full year 2023 targets in both net revenue and second half profitability. They also made significant strides in the technology road map with the launching of a new app design and with single account, single wallet capabilities being available now in those states. Looking ahead, our outlook remains strong. We're encouraged by the metrics we've seen in our business including room and rates on the books and in-the-year group attendance and future bookings as well as the robust event calendar for the city. Our Las Vegas operations, which represented more than 70% of our U.S. brick-and-mortar adjusted property EBITDAR in 2023, will benefit from a number of key initiatives in '24. For example, our transient segment will grow as a result of the Marriott relationship, which will bring a new customer base that will be acquired at lower acquisition costs, higher rates and more spend on property. On the group side, the Mandalay Bay Convention Center refresh is nearly complete, and we're poised to benefit from an increased 100,000-plus group room nights on The Strip. With MGM's casino segment, we will drive growth from the return of Far East baccarat play, which is still below 2019 levels. We will leverage our branch office network to drive customers to our resorts in Las Vegas and expect to see further recovery of international inbound flights, which are still only 75% recovered from Asia. Later this week, we will hold our annual Chinese New Year celebration at Bellagio and Aria, which is already seeing stronger gaming demand than last year. Our 2024 regional outlook anticipates demand to remain stable. That being said, we are committed to consistently improving our operational model, sustain margins and foster a steady generation of free cash flow. Our regional portfolio has historically proven to be highly defensive, thanks to the exceptional high-quality assets we operate, the diverse set of non-gaming amenities we offer, our strong market share positioning and overall customer loyalty. Looking ahead in Macau, our exceptional results for 2023 have carried into the first 45 days of 2024 driven by successful events, including a Bruno Mars concert at the MGM Cotai, driving strong visitation to our properties. Demand in our properties for Chinese New Year, which is also going on now, is also very strong. As we look further into the year, the Macau government has set a target to attract 33 million visitors in 2024, reflecting a 17% increase year-over-year, a testament to our team's continuous innovation in crafting compelling experiences for our predominantly premium mass clientele. Our focuses on the New Year in Macau remain on three priorities: implementing strategic adjustments to our casino floor and existing room offerings to optimize yield, prioritizing the needs of our mass and premium mass customers and actively driving international tourism. Turning to BetMGM. In 2024, we will soon be live in 29 markets with the launch of North Carolina next month. We had a noteworthy technology achievement in January with the approval and subsequent migration of the Entain platform in Nevada. This sets the stage for integration of single account, single wallet in Nevada later this spring, which is critical to our omnichannel thesis and will fully unlock one of the key differentiators for BetMGM by fully leveraging our Las Vegas properties. Within our international digital space, in the U.K., LeoVegas, BetMGM's KPIs have exceeded our initial projections, demonstrating again the strength of MGM's brand. In fact, by leveraging the MGM Resorts' balance sheet, we now offer the highest jackpot payouts amongst all competitors in the U.S., making our offers even that much more compelling. Turning to our development pipeline. In Osaka, we successfully began liquefaction countermeasures in the fourth quarter, maintaining our trajectory to commence preparatory construction efforts in 2025, on time for a 2030 opening. Additionally, in New York, the request for proposal process is currently underway. We anticipate submitting our full application to the government by the middle of this year with a decision expected shortly thereafter. Putting it all together, our company is in a great position to generate free cash flow through 2028. We'll deploy this free cash strategically into development projects such as Japan and New York; we'll reinvest in our existing portfolio through maintenance and growth CapEx, which we are specifically focused on enhancing and expanding our luxury-oriented offerings; and the repurchase of shares at attractive levels and investment, which we believe will still continue to generate strong returns. Jonathan, over to you."", 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""Thanks, Bill. And before I dig into the financial results, I'd like to join Bill in thanking our employees at MGM Resorts for an outstanding quarter and a truly great year. While I certainly focus on our exceptional financial results, we accomplished that and so much more together. Our consolidated businesses in the fourth quarter generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 22% from last year; net income of $202 million; and adjusted EBITDAR of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, net cash from operating activities was $716 million and free cash flow was $387 million. It's important to note the $283 million in cash flow from operating activities and $18 million in capital expenditures related to MGM China, and they were included in the quarter. For the full year of 2023, free cash flow was $1.8 billion. In Las Vegas, same-store net revenues, which excludes Mirage from the prior year period, was $2.4 billion, up 10% over last year. On previous calls, we've talked about the fact that our operations in Las Vegas skew towards the high end, with approximately 80% of our strip adjusted property EBITDAR coming from our luxury properties. Interestingly, this year's revenues from our luxury properties increased mid-teens for the quarter and the year, representing approximately 90% of our absolute top line growth. And this further highlights the prominence of the higher-end segments in our business here in Las Vegas. Same-store adjusted property EBITDAR increased 3% or $29 million year-over-year. Margins were about 36% in the quarter, well within our expected range in the mid-30s. In the regions, same-store revenue, which excludes Gold Strike, was down 7% year-over-year, with same-store adjusted property EBITDAR decreasing $64 million or 22%. It's important to note that approximately $60 million of the decrease year-over-year came from Detroit and National Harbor, where those properties were impacted by disruptions related to a strike and some high-end play not returning, respectively. There was also some lingering cyber incident challenges that specifically impacted the regional portfolio given that promotional offers were not available to our customers for the first half of October. Beyond these specific property circumstances in the fourth quarter, the regional property trends remained stable. As we look to drive future growth within our domestic portfolio, our centers of excellence and property leaders have identified opportunities to increase our share of customer spend and drive organic growth. We see plenty of both near-term and medium-term opportunities to enhance revenue per occupied room night even beyond the benefits of the Marriott partnership. For example, adaptive pricing will maximize throughput within our high-demand outlets and will further enhance our ability to drive upsells and new product offerings. This includes bundled packages with room, show and food and beverage offerings. We expect these initiatives to drive RevPAR growth in 2024. Improved segmentation will allow us to increase personalization and enhance the guest experience while driving increased NPS and overall customer lifetime value. An omnichannel purchase behavior by our MGM Rewards members will be enhanced by a single account, single wallet in Nevada later this year. Once in action, our customers will be able to open an account here in Las Vegas and bring that wallet home to continue their experience with MGM Resorts, allowing us to drive targeted marketing and outreach to further cross-sell our digital and physical assets. Moving over to MGM China. Our record adjusted property EBITDAR of $262 million was a 42% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This was driven by casino revenue, which increased 31% versus the fourth quarter of 2019, and more specifically our main floor segment table games win, which increased 74% from 2019. Margins were in line with the first 3 quarters of the year at 27%. Market share was an all-time record in the fourth quarter at over 16%. And for the full year, our market share exceeded 15%, which is 600 basis points above our 2019 performance and 300 basis points above our table fair share. On the digital side, BetMGM successfully met its 2023 targets by reporting positive EBITDA in the second half of the year and reaching the upper limit of its net revenue from operations guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. And let me close, as usual, with a brief walk-through of our capital allocation strategy and our valuation. First off, we successfully closed on an amendment and extension of our seam-secured credit facility this week. This expands our capacity by approximately $600 million to $2.3 billion and extends the maturity of that facility to 2029. The commitment from our relationship banks allows us to sustain our financial policy of a minimum $3 billion in liquidity while deploying incremental cash for further high-return investments, including share repurchases. As Bill mentioned, we expect to fully fund the equity contribution in Japan and the commercial gaming expansion in New York with our free cash flow. Domestically, we intend to invest maintenance capital of approximately $600 million this year or 4% of revenue, which is consistent with our historical trend. Major maintenance capital projects this year focus on luxury-oriented offerings, examples being the remodeling of the Bellagio Tower Suites, the Cosmopolitan Chelsea Tower penthouses and the MGM Grand Main Tower rooms. As of the end of 2023, we had liquidity of $4.5 billion when excluding MGM China. Excluding the cash that we keep on hand to operate our business, in keeping with our policy, we have $1 billion in excess cash, which will be allocated to international and digital acquisitions, high ROI capital projects, and share repurchases. We continue to see great value in our shares. And during the year, with a $2.3 billion repurchase of our shares, we reduced our share count by 14%. To close, I would briefly like to discuss our enterprise valuation and why we still believe share repurchases are a remunerative use of our capital. Consider the following. As of yesterday, our share price was $47, and we had 320 million shares outstanding. This equates to a market capitalization of $15.1 billion. And if we add our quarter end domestic net debt and subtract the market value of our 56% stake in MGM China and analyst consensus estimates for the value of our 50% of BetMGM, then we have the enterprise value of our operations less China and BetMGM of $10.6 billion. Divide this by our 2023 EBITDA adjusted for corporate expense, and we calculate an implied current trailing trading multiple of just 4.9x. We think this multiple represents a discount to the value that we see in our future cash flows, which provides us further conviction in returning capital to shareholders by repurchasing our shares at these levels. Bill, back to you."", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Thanks, Jonathan. Before I open it up for questions, maybe just some general comments on the year. And you've heard me say this and used these words, resilient and luxury, a couple of times. If you think about, particularly this last quarter, we were on our heels with a cyberattack. You all understood what that did to us. And so as we entered October, to think we'd end up having the quarter we had, I couldn't be prouder of the organization. And it particularly shown through in luxury. Bellagio, after 25 years, had its best quarter in its history and its best year in its history. And so it does prove that in continuing to invest in these properties in the right place at the right time does make a difference. And so we're very excited by thinking about that as we continue to go forward. I think about what happened with BetMGM and ultimately, our database. MGM Rewards database now has over 44 million participants driven by BetMGM and ultimately, the omnichannel effect of that long term will begin, we think, to pay dividends. Macau is doing amazingly well. I know some of our competitors are wondering what we're doing. Kenny and the team broke through 20% in the month of January for market share. I'm not suggesting that's sustainable. But I will tell you, I think we have repositioned those 2 properties, and we're prepared to compete on an equal basis with anybody in the marketplace. When I think about BetMGM, the original goal 5 years ago was to get into the top 3 because we thought it mattered. And we have. We realize there's focus on product. There are some things we need to do to maintain and keep market share. And we think moves by that team, with Angstrom and other things, have done that for us. We realized, particularly this quarter, there's pressure on regional margins. We know what they did. But remember what Jonathan said, $60 million of the $64 million was tied to two events: a Detroit strike and ultimately, a player in our National Harbor company didn't come back year-over-year. We find ourselves with one of the best balance sheets in the industry, which well positions us to invest in places like Japan and New York. We are looking aggressively at the U.A.E., and Gary Fritz and the digital team has constant things in front of us in terms of growing the balance of our worldwide digital business. And so we're excited by all of that. And then obviously, if again, you follow Jonathan's math, like every CEO, we think we're under-traded at 4.9x, but obviously, you all will be the judge of that. So with that, operator, I will open it up for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.', 'Joseph Richard Greff', 'Starting off with the Las Vegas, Bill, Jonathan and whoever else is in the room there, can you talk about maybe isolating in the fourth quarter the EBITDA contribution from F1? And then you might be still counting your money from the Super Bowl, but do you think the Super Bowl event in Las Vegas is of a larger magnitude than what the EBITDA contribution from F1 was in the fourth quarter? And then sticking to the topic of F1, Bill, you mentioned about maybe you have a better priced F1 this year and in coming years. Do you think year 2 can be bigger than year 1? Or does it have to level off before it can grow?', 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Let me give some broad stroke and then Corey and Jonathan both kick in. Look, F1, when you balance it out year-over-year, it was actually a $70 million increase year-over-year. But if I neutralize the year before, it was about $50 million. We didn't run lucky the year before. Super Bowl was amazing. We were always concerned, we do great Super Bowl parties here, will it be the kind of event that will drive given the additional expense of the tickets, et cetera, et cetera? The answer was hands-down yes, and particularly rooms, and it drove them across the board. Unlike where F1 was isolated to our premium properties, Super Bowl drove it across the board. We had thousands of people in all of our ballrooms in the MGM Grand Garden enjoying the game and enjoying the festivities. And so it was a really successful universal event. Las Vegas showed up, and I think we all did a tremendous job hosting it. And where I was skeptical going in, I would look to clearly want to host this again. I think on pricing when it comes to Formula One, we're going to be more cautious at some of the outlier properties that we have. We got paid for Bellagio, Aria, Cosmopolitan along the track, and we got paid well. I think the further away you've got from the track, with a couple of exceptions, MGM held in there well because of its adjacency to the paddock. There's opportunity to do that better and get more people back into the town."", 'Corey Ian Sanders', ""What I would add, Joe, on F1 in particular, the south Strip in particular, we would treat that probably more like a normal weekend going forward because of the lack of activation there. So we think there's opportunity there. And on Super Bowl, I mean, every cash register, from food and beverage to entertainment, was ringing. So it was much more widespread at every property compared to F1, which was isolated to the luxury."", 'Joseph Richard Greff', ""Great. And Bill, maybe this is a good chance for you to revisit any updated thinking and the Board's thinking on any kind of large-scale digital M&A. Has anything really changed or evolved since the last time you made public commentary on it?"", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""No. Look, I was at ICE last week, I met with Stella, our partner. We're still very focused on making sure everyone's focus is on BetMGM. And particularly this is a critical year, I think, for all of us. So it's about product, product, product and focus. And so that remains the focus for now."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.', 'Carlo Santarelli', ""I respect that you've talked about this previously and not really breaking out kind of impacts from hold, but clearly, in Las Vegas, in the third and fourth quarter, you've experienced much higher than at least what we're accustomed to hold percentages. And I was wondering if, a, you could perhaps provide some impact in the fourth quarter in Las Vegas from the hold; and b, maybe just talk about more quantitatively what's driving it and how sustainable or what you would think, if you had to go back and do it again, normalized hold is in the current environment."", 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""Carlo, it's Jonathan. Yes, we've tried to get out of the business of giving quantifying hold impacts because, as you know, there's a lot of things that cut both ways when trying to isolate the impact of hold. It's certainly true that we experienced good hold in the fourth quarter. But I would also say that, first of all, with this customer segment that drove some of those results, the nature of the play is such that it can lead to higher hold anyway. So the whole idea of what a normal hold is, is a little bit different. And then second of all, there are expenses associated with these customer segments, including, of course, the normal complementaries as well as, in certain cases, discounts in order to induce more rapid retirement of markers and the like. But look, it positively contributed to the results. There's no question about that. But I would also highlight that there were offsets to that, including player-related expenses, as well as some other things we incurred in the quarter."", 'Carlo Santarelli', ""Okay. Good enough. I appreciate that, Jonathan. And then just one follow-up on Macau and perhaps kind of how you're thinking about things there. Obviously, the results are very good. The market share results continue to be very good. But the flow-through in the period, if we look at it on a sequential basis, was a little lower. And I'm wondering if that has anything to do with just kind of expenses that you're incurring or if it's concession-related programming, things of that nature, if you can give us some color on how we should think about 2024 through the context of flow-through and top line growth."", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Let me kick it off, Kenny, I'll turn it over to you. Some of it is simple activity case, to your point, I mean, we have done like all the operatives, a good job going after some of the -- and I'll use our concert that we just had is a great example of an expansion and overhead item, but to drive overall tourism with Bruno Mars, et cetera. So part of it's adhering to that. Kenny, why don't you give some more color though."", 'Xiaofeng Feng', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. Actually, as you can see, like Q4 was a record high in MGM China, basically. We are happy to see that our January performance has continued to grow. So actually, our January performance has exceeded even October levels across all segments, including EBITDA and market share. Currently, we are in the middle of Chinese New Year basically, which is about 8 days' celebration. As to the visitation to the city, it has reached about 90%, 95% of 2019 same-period levels. As to MGM China, 2 properties combined, the visitation, the players count, the table drop, the slot handle as well as the VIP turnover have all well exceeded 2019 same-period levels. So we are confident and we are optimistic with the Chinese New Year as well as the rest of this quarter."", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""And Kenny, I just might add, look, contras are growing as our high volume continues to increase because, again, that's on us versus a junket operative in the middle of that. And I'll remind everybody, on our margins in particular, we do not, I wish we did, but we do not have a large retail segment, which obviously, there's a massive amount of flow-through if you're making $100 million a year in rent, which I know some of our competitors are. The flow-through on that is a lot. We don't have that luxury. So it does impact some of our margins."", 'Carlo Santarelli', 'Because you mentioned it, in terms of the contra revenues, it looks like they were 21%, 22% at each of the properties, respectively, in the period. Is that kind of a level that you expect maintains as long as business mix as it stands today maintains?', 'Xiaofeng Feng', ""Yes, that's right. The reinvestment rate actually is pretty flat over the quarters for the past year."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from David Katz with Jefferies.', 'David Brian Katz', ""I want to just go back to BetMGM. Obviously, there is a keen focus on product in 2024 as it's been in 2023. Should we still think about 2024 as more of an investment year for that entity and if 2025 is one where we can start to sort of realize some profits? If you could just talk through the puts and takes for what might cause that trajectory to change this year, next year, that would be helpful."", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Sure, David. I'll take that. Look, I think the answer is yes, you're spot-on. This will be a reinvestment year. Obviously, you've seen we've lost share, literally, in both instances. And the two folks that sit above us were being outspent 2, 2.5 to 1 in terms of raw marketing spend in dollars. We want and need to get our product in a better and different shape. We want more parlays. Obviously, the acquisition of Angstrom by our partner will be a big add to that. We'll be able to stick out more product, we'll have more confidence in it, speed to market will be better, et cetera. And so that's part of what will be developed starting with baseball this year. We hope by the time we hit football next year, a lot of the product differentiators hope to have will be in play. We hope to have a single wallet in play, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, this spring here. But ultimately, a development year this year, begin to see making some cash next year, and I'm suggesting that by 2026, we're going to have a very strong first year of -- this is where this business is going and should be."", 'David Brian Katz', ""And look, it'd be silly for me to ask, as my follow-up, will you or won't you, and so I'm not. But if you could just help us frame out the puts and takes around whether BetMGM could at some point or how it thinks about controlling that entity and being able to drive the trajectory of that product advancement that makes perfect sense, that would be helpful. So it's obviously a matter that's discussed pretty actively."", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""David, I would only echo what I said. Look, with Stella as the interim CEO, the focus on the team for product for BetMGM is the focus. I don't want to comment on any other further discussion with them at this point. I don't think it'd be prudent."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley.', 'Stephen White Grambling', 'Just thinking about Vegas into 2024, do you generally think of this year as being more of a lodging and F&B year versus a gaming year? And in that context, how should we think about OpEx per day growth in Vegas specifically in the year? What are the major puts and takes to think through?', 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""Yes. Actually, I think that's probably a good way to characterize it. When we look at the drivers of growth this year, and we've talked about a few of them already, a lot of it relates to yielding, pricing, of course, growing demand through this new Marriott partnership and so on."", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', 'Conventions.', 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""Yes, and the conventions business. Thank you, Bill. So those are going to be the main drivers of top line growth. As it relates to OpEx, while, of course, we don't provide guidance for either the top line or the bottom line, we are looking at increases, the main increases associated with our new labor agreement here in Las Vegas with a culinary union. So that will be at least a year-over-year factor for the first half of the year, not really in the back half of the year, since we already incurred that in the last 6 months of the year. That will be the main issue for us. We'll be able to offset that in part through some work we're doing around productivity as well as improvement in cost of sales through leverage procurement activities. But I think kind of a low to mid-single-digit OpEx growth rate, I wouldn't be surprised if we incur that this year."", 'Stephen White Grambling', ""And then maybe one other follow-up just on the buyback, I guess, how do you think through the pace that we should be anticipating this year? And what's kind of the upper bound in terms of leverage that you should be thinking through?"", 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""The upper bound of leverage would be 4.5x lease-adjusted leverage, and we're a full turn below that right now. I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we retired 14% of our outstanding shares last year. It may have been our largest share repurchase year-to-date. I wouldn't anticipate continuing at that pace this year. But we're still active in the market. We still think that the shares are attractively valued. And we still have a fair amount of dry powder, just augmented with our revolving credit increase, to enable us to do that. So I would say it's likely going to be less than it was in 2023, but we're still being aggressive."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.', 'Daniel Brian Politzer', ""First, I wanted to drill in a little bit just in the fourth quarter in Las Vegas. I think your same-store revenues were up about 10%, margins down a couple of hundred basis points. I know there's a lot of moving pieces in there in accruals and maybe some cyber impact and hold, but hoping maybe you could just parse that out as it would be helpful for us to think about that 2024 OpEx guide you mentioned."", 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""Sure. When we kind of parse it out, accounting for unusual items or things that we wouldn't expect to recur, we think that the margin in the fourth quarter in Las Vegas was maybe benefited by about 100 basis points. So that still puts us right in the mid-30s, which is where we've kind of expected the margins to be for some time. That's where we expect them to be for 2024."", 'Daniel Brian Politzer', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, more broadly on Las Vegas, as we think about kind of the remainder of the year, I think March, you have CON/AGG rolling off, March Madness, but you have group, as you mentioned, kind of pacing better. How should we think about kind of baking it all in, in terms of an expectation for growth, or any major tent-pole events to kind of call out for the remainder of the year that we should get excited about?"", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""We've got just top line, off the top of my head, Madonna's coming, Springsteen's coming, The Stones are coming, to name three. We've got a great football kickoff with USC, LSU coming. To your point, obviously, March Madness is always a big deal around here. And then Formula 1 rolls back around again. We are going to miss the Pac-12 championship next year. No, we've got 1 more year, I take that back, so we won't miss that. And so we all must admit, 2023, and if you think about the recent stretch we've just been through, was an amazing year and an amazing stretch. So replicating that won't be easy. But having said that, we still have plenty of content and activity case that kind of fill the void and fill the dates."", 'Corey Ian Sanders', ""And from a city perspective, I think the Sphere has been a great addition. The T-Mobile will be programmed more than it was last year. So all in all, I think it's going to be a really strong year. As you think about March, it won't only be CON/AGG, we also have Easter ending in March. So that will have a slight impact in March on the convention business but will be picked up in April."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.', 'Shaun Clisby Kelley', ""Maybe just sticking with Las Vegas for a moment, Bill, you called out a lot of great commentary and color around the high end, just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on maybe those core properties kind of outside the high end. What are you seeing on the customer behavior side? What's going to take to drive some growth and improvement at some of those properties as you look out to 2024?"", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Well, I'll tell you one thing and Corey can pick this up. But the flow-through, or the spill-off, I should say, from the 100,000 more room nights principally at Mandalay for conference and convention business does flow into Luxor with setup crews, pieces and parts of these various groups, even in the Excalibur. So I think that's an opportunistic thing. Obviously, whether it's resort fees on through, we've gone through with a pricing exercise. We'll continue to do that to try to recapture, particularly the culinary increase, which we all know this year is going to be an extensive one. Then it falls off and basically flattens out for the balance of the 4.5 years. So Corey, anything?"", 'Corey Ian Sanders', ""Yes, the legacy properties, the growth is going to be a little bit limited there. It's a small percent of our Vegas revenue. As Bill mentioned, the convention mix, not just here but in town, in citywide, will help some overflow there. But it definitely won't have the same benefits that the luxury properties are and will see."", 'Shaun Clisby Kelley', ""Great. And just as my follow-up, I think it was called out in the prepared remarks, but $1 billion earmarked across a variety of things, including international, digital, just help us think through what some of the criteria would be there. I mean, again, I know a lot of eyeballs are focused on something more transformative with your partner. But it sounds like this is more along the lines of what you've done with LeoVegas. So maybe just give us some parameters of what could check some boxes for you in terms of that opportunity looking out for this year or next?"", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Sure. We contemplated 4 key pillars to getting and setting up our own shop, if you will. And so we bought LeoVegas with that in mind. We've obviously now gone and bought Push Gaming, which is a content studio. By the way, their first game, MGM Millions, or MGM Money Millions, whatever it's called, #1 game on our network; #1, first game out, branded with MGM. We are on the heels of buying Sports Technology. We want to obviously be in our own sports betting business with our own technology. And over time, we have Kambi that we use for LeoVegas. We are on the heels of a deal for Live Dealer where we've talked about and had a vision of broadcasting live games from Las Vegas to rest of world with some celebrities and entertainment tied to them, and we're on the heels of that. I'm heading down to South America next week or the week after to look at a large JV. Brazil is going to put Internet gaming in play for both casino and sports betting, and we plan to be there when that launches. And so we're focused on building that business at its core into a real business. We've taken BetMGM U.K., as we've talked about. We've got well over 100,000 first-time depositors already in the 4.5 short months. And we're looking at another country already to do the same thing. And so we're going to grow the business. And if we ultimately acquire something else, time to tell, but for now staying focused on that is paramount to us."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays.', 'Brandt Antoine Montour', ""So just first, I wanted to go back to Macau and ask Carlo's question in a little bit of a different way. If we just look at sort of OpEx, excluding gaming taxes, for the fourth quarter, that number did step up a little bit. And I'm just curious, if you look at that on maybe a per day basis versus '19 or however you look at that, is there onetime maybe events-related OpEx in that quarter? And what I'm really getting at is if you guys think we should be thinking about that sort of level as a run rate going forward."", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Kenny, maybe you could speak to this more intelligently, but I can tell you broad stroke, remember, the requirement we have, we have to spend $1.1 billion in 10-year commitment in OpEx driving tourism, and there's about $900 million or so in actual capital expense. So we've got a little over $2 billion commitment to the government, of which the $1.1 billion is pure OpEx. And so a lot of the activity case in driving international tourism and driving tourism isn't necessarily tied to the usual marketing programs that we'd think about in gaming."", 'Xiaofeng Feng', 'Okay. This is Kenny. As you know, like for the past year, with the new concession, we added another 200 tables. Of course, we added a little bit more FTEs. We have more daily table open hours. But in general, we are very, very tight regarding our OpEx control. You can see from our EBITDA margin, over the quarters of the last year, we are very stable, in the high 20s, along with our market share gains and the business growth. As Bill just commented, we do not have so much high-margin retail rental EBITDA, but our gaming EBITDA margin is really way up there in this marketplace. I can see for the next for these next couple of quarters, we should be quite stable with our margins.', 'Brandt Antoine Montour', ""Okay. That's perfect. And then circling back on digital and BetMGM specifically, I was wondering, Bill, if you want to comment at all on the sort of newly announced partnership with X, what you can say about how that deal came together, the structure of the deal, and anything from an economic standpoint that you can share and then what you expect the impact to be over time."", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Look, it's interesting. It just started, as you know. So we have high hopes for it. We had literally 100 million people, when they flipped on X yesterday, day before, are going to be exposed to that offering and that opportunity. That team is probably much better positioned to give you some input on what they think the outcome is going to be. I can remember from the various presentations that if you captured about 0.1% of those folks, it was a significant uptick to the company, and it's efficient. The way we've structured this deal compared to other even general bonusing, it's an extremely efficient deal for us. So we'll see. Our customers live there. But everyone was on X, I guess, but we particularly think the demographic fits well for what we do."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.', 'Chad C. Beynon', ""I wanted to ask about the regional properties. I guess, more so in the current quarter, we've seen a number of public releases out there for January showing that there's been some pretty significant declines. And it sounds like most of that is kind of chalked up to bad weather, and we've heard that from a lot of companies. So a, maybe if you're willing to kind of touch on that given that many of your properties are in these areas that may have inclement weather in January. And then more importantly, is that core customer in the regional markets stable? Are we seeing any trends kind of rolling off in terms of that low end? Or does it still feel as good as you kind of look out to '24?"", 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""Yes. I would say that certain of our properties were affected by the weather. Springfield comes to mind as one. Empire is another. But we also saw some pockets of strength in January as well. I would say both because of weather effects as well as the calendar a bit coming off of New Year's, January saw some of those impacts in our regional markets."", 'Corey Ian Sanders', ""Players are pretty stable from all age groups and all spend. During COVID, we actually eliminated a lot of that low end play. So in general, what we're seeing in February, we're pretty positive on. And we feel pretty comfortable that what you saw in January was a weather-related component of the business."", 'Chad C. Beynon', ""Okay. Great. Appreciate that near-term color. And then with respect to New York, is there any update in terms of the time line as we get through '24, anything to speak to us about?"", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Yes, this is Bill. No, I wish there was. I know they're going through some of these zoning things by all of the boroughs. I think, ultimately, we're going to wait and see what happens. I suspect they're going to wait and see what happens there. It may make a decision for them. And then in fact, they'll come back to us with the round 2 questions, and then that gives our 90-day clock going. But we're hopeful, by the middle of this year, we get something submitted and that by the end of '24, something is awarded. But we don't know anymore, unfortunately."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities.', 'Barry Jonathan Jonas', ""As you think about the potential for A's baseball stadium, how does that influence your thinking about incremental CapEx for your adjacent properties over the next few years?"", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Very interesting question. We've been thinking about that, talking about it. For us, obviously, the place to invest capital, first and foremost, if in fact that all happens, is MGM. I mean it's our brand. It's our name's sake. It's on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard drop. It would literally be adjacent to the stadium, and it needs some love. It's a 30-year-old property. We're going to reinvest in the rooms this year. We've got some new show concepts. We've done a few restaurants. But the front end of the property, as you get closer to Las Vegas Boulevard, needs some attention and some reprogramming. We're waiting to see where that lands. I have to believe, in the next 30 to 60 days, we should find out more. I've been shown three versions of it now in terms of where it will actually sit on the site and how it will connect. Once it settles in, we'll get serious about what we might want to do and how we might want to communicate with it, if you will, in terms of pedestrian traffic, et cetera. But that's how to think about where we might go first is really MGM and see how it all plays out."", 'Barry Jonathan Jonas', 'Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, you talked a bit about U.A.E., but maybe can you get into what the next steps are for gaming legalization there? And maybe also elaborate on how you could potentially participate in Abu Dhabi.', 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""As I think we suggested last year, we spent some time on the ground there, specifically in Abu Dhabi, trying to understand the license in general for U.A.E., but ultimately, the opportunity in Abu Dhabi. We believe it would be on the Yas Island. That opportunity still exists. To the extent there is a submission to be had, we may participate in that. Obviously, we have Dubai. We have our project there, which is an amazing project. It's going to be over a $2.5 billion project without a casino in it. And so if and when both Abu Dhabi itself as the general license granter for all or any of the Emirates goes, and then ultimately, one by one, the Emirates say they would like it, we hope to be positioned either for Dubai or Abu Dhabi, but time to tell. And it may start with digital first, a lottery, potentially digital."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Robin Farley with UBS.', 'Robin Margaret Farley', 'I just have two pretty quick ones. One is just if you could clarify, in the regional for Q4, I think it was $60 million, how much of that was just the strike, if we were trying to think about just the kind of nonrecurring piece of that $60 million decline?', 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', 'Yes. The $60 million, roughly half is related to the strike and the other half to the National Harbor.', 'Robin Margaret Farley', ""Okay. Great. And I don't know if you said for Marriott, and I know it's only been a couple of weeks, but did you give any metrics about what percent of room nights or kind of the dollar premium on rooms sold through Marriott, any color like that you could give?"", 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""We did give some expectations, I believe it was second quarter earnings call in August of last year, Robin. And although our implementation was delayed from October to a few weeks ago to January, our estimation of what the arrangement can bring us has not changed. So I'd just refer you back to those measures that we gave in August."", 'Robin Margaret Farley', ""Does that mean that it's kind of too early to know what the last 3 weeks? In other words, like at the moment, no change in your expectations? Or are you seeing enough to say that it's delivering those numbers?"", 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""The answer is yes. It's early days. But as I think Bill noted in his opening remarks, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing in the first few weeks."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from John DeCree with CBRE.', 'John G. DeCree', ""Maybe a high-level question, to get your view on the consumer, so we talked a lot about the performance at your high-end properties in Las Vegas. I'm curious if you see similar trends or consumer trends at your regional properties, is it the high end and high tiers of the database that are driving performance there as well? Or might the business mix be a little bit more balanced? And realizing regionals have the same event draw that Vegas does, but curious if you have kind of a view on the segments of the database from a consumer perspective?"", 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""Yes. It's Jonathan. I'll offer a couple of comments. The answer is yes, but really for different reasons. In the regional markets, I think, as Corey mentioned, we've really directed our marketing efforts, and to a certain extent, the property amenities themselves, to higher-worth guests. We've reduced our marketing investments and promotional investments on the lower end. And that really started in the aftermath of the pandemic, and it's carried forward. So the fact is that the increases that we've seen in those regional properties are really predominantly from the higher average daily worth customers. But I say it's the same effect for different reasons because in Las Vegas, what has been really driving this has been our special events, our focus on these customers through our branch offices and our own marketing efforts. And obviously, the citywide events that are going on have skewed more toward that high-end luxury growth as well as our capital investment in our luxury properties, so same effect for different reasons."", 'John G. DeCree', 'I appreciate that color. And then maybe quickly on the growth CapEx plan this year. I think you listed a couple of the projects that go into that bucket, and you guys have this dialed in pretty tight by now. But is there anything that we should think about in terms of disruption? Are any of those projects large enough or the timing of such that we might want to think about any disruption at the assets?', 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""I would say no. I've been at MGM for 3 years, and I've been amazed at our operator's ability to manage through disruption and room renovations as well as on the casino floor, but mainly in the room renovations. If you think what we've done just in the last year or so with New York-New York, the spa tower, The Water Club, the Borgata, et cetera. This year, we have, the ones I mentioned, Chelsea suites, we're starting in the MGM Grand and so on, and also in the Bellagio Main Tower suite. So no, I would not advise you to really incorporate any disruption from those investments."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.', 'Steven Moyer Wieczynski', 'So real quickly, just two quick questions for me, but when we think about margins in the regional markets, look, I understand there was a material impact in the fourth quarter from the strikes and the customer at National Harbor, but Jonathan, maybe just how are you guys thinking about the way margins could look for this year?', 'Jonathan S. Halkyard', ""Yes. There were a lot of things going on this quarter. I would say that we can do 30% margins in the regions. We do have a number of tools at our disposal, but we're also facing some labor cost increases there. But when we do the forensics on the fourth quarter and look ahead to this year, we believe that, that's achievable."", 'Corey Ian Sanders', ""And in the regionals, especially fourth quarter because of weather and it's a little slower, you'll have a little bit lower margin in the fourth quarter, but 30% for the year is attainable."", 'Steven Moyer Wieczynski', ""Okay. Great. And then Bill and Jonathan, you've given us a lot of color around the gives and takes for this year in Vegas. So without getting too much into guidance, I'm going to try to ask this question and see if I'll get an answer out of you, but I guess the simple question is, do you think it's actually possible to grow full year EBITDA this year? Are the overall comparisons, the hold comparison, is just going to be too tough to overcome?"", 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""No. Look, I think the answer is yes. I think we've budgeted to that. We've convinced our Board of that. We're incentivized to do that. And I think the answer is yes. Obviously, '23 was an amazing year. We've got some headwinds with particularly labor costs. But there's enough programming out there, enough momentum that, in macro, we think we surpass. And so it's not going to be like double-digit, I can assure you, but I think we surpass."", 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Hornbuckle for any closing remarks.', 'William Joseph Hornbuckle', ""Thank you, operator. Thank you all for joining us today. Just a couple of thoughts. I mentioned this word earlier, again, resiliency, our troops have demonstrated, so I again want to thank them. '23 was an incredible year. We had an all-time EBITDA year, 7 of our properties continue to break records, and so we're anxious for the future. Macau is well positioned. We've ended up in a great space in digital, and we're in the game for real for the long haul, and so you'll see us continue to do that. And we launched our own digital brand and business in rest of world, and so excited by it, excited by the balance sheet and the development opportunities. Remember in '23, Japan came our way, which is one and only and a very unique thing for the company in the long term. And so we're excited by that and potentially the opportunity that New York may bring. So '23 was a great year. We hope to replicate it and then some in '24. And we thank you for your time."", 'Operator', 'The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.']"

Finally, this presentation is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.', 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, and thank you, all, for joining us today. MGM Resorts achieved outstanding results in 2023, delivering all-time high adjusted property EBITDAR in Las Vegas and in MGM China. Notably, seven of our domestic properties set individual records for adjusted property EBITDAR for the full year. These outstanding accomplishments underscore the resilience and the agility of our team in navigating a complex operating year.', ""In fact, our employees earned record NPS scores from our customers throughout 2023. I want to thank all of our dedicated employees who consistently strive to deliver on world-class service to our guests. The strength and resiliency of the Las Vegas market has been particularly impressive. Strategically, you've heard me talk a lot last year about the evolution of Las Vegas as a new sports and entertainment capital of the world."", 'You saw that fact proven out again Sunday as the city proudly hosted Super Bowl LVIII right in our own backyard. The game was another strong hotel and casino event for us with ADRs near 1,000 and posting three of the top five room revenue days ever recorded and near-record event gaming volumes. The game weekend is typically a strong event for MGM Resorts, but having the game in town amplified those results dramatically. The game on Sunday followed our inaugural Formula 1 race in November, which was also an incredible success as the largest city event in our history.', 'Additionally, we gleaned valuable insights from the event and specifically on how to better price and program all of our resorts and streamline the preparation work for future years. With both F1 and Super Bowl, our brand was on full display. Our proximity to Allegiant Stadium, the F1 track, and of course, T-Mobile Arena afforded us the opportunity to expand our reach during these citywide events. We also have officially launched our partnership with Marriott with impressive early results.', 'Marriott Bonvoy customers can now seamlessly book rooms at select MGM properties in Las Vegas with 16 brands set to be introduced by the end of Q1. In Macau, we ended 2023 with an all-time record adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter and the full year. Our robust market share was comfortably in the mid-teens and continued its upward trend in January. The strategic addition of 200 table games, coupled with the agile operations of our team and the reinvestment into many amenities, have collectively driven these exceptional results.', ""In digital, BetMGM made its full-year 2023 targets in both net revenue and second-half profitability. They also made significant strides in the technology road map with the launching of a new app design and with single-account, single-wallet capabilities being available now in most states. Looking ahead, our outlook remains strong. We're encouraged by the metrics we've seen in our business, including room and rates on the books and in the year group attendance and future bookings, as well as a robust event calendar for the city."", ""Our Las Vegas operations would represent more than 70% of our U.S. brick-and-mortar adjusted property EBITDAR in 2023 will benefit from a number of key initiatives in '24. For example, our transient segment will grow as a result of the Marriott relationship, which will bring a new customer base and will be acquired at lower acquisition costs, higher rates, and more spend on property. On the group side, the Mandalay Bay Convention Center refresh is nearly complete, and we're poised to benefit from an increased 100,000-plus group room nights on The Strip."", ""With MGM's casino segment, we will drive growth from the return of Far East baccarat play, which is still below 2019 levels. We will leverage our branch office network to drive customers to our resorts in Las Vegas and expect to see further recovery of international inbound flights, which are still only 75% recovered from Asia. Later this week, we will host our annual Chinese New Year celebration at Bellagio and ARIA, which is already seeing strong gaming demand -- stronger gaming demand, excuse me, than last year. Our 2024 regional outlook anticipates demand to remain stable."", ""That being said, we are committed to consistently improving our operational model, sustain margins, and foster a steady generation of free cash flow. Our regional portfolio has historically proven to be highly defensive, thanks to the exceptional high-quality assets we operate, the diverse set of nongaming amenities we offer, our strong market share positioning, and overall customer loyalty. Looking ahead in Macau, our exceptional results for 2023 have carried into the first 45 days of 2024, driven by successful events, including a Bruno Mars concert at the MGM Cotai driving strong visitation to our properties. Demand in our properties for Chinese New Year's, which is also going on now, is also very strong."", ""As we look further into the year, the Macau government has set a target of track 33 million visitors in 2024, reflecting a 17% increase year over year. This is a testament to our team's continuous innovation and crafting compelling experiences for our predominantly premium mass clientele. Our focuses on the New Year in Macau remain on three priorities: implementing strategic adjustments to our casino floor and existing room offerings to optimize yield, prioritizing the needs of our mass and premium mass customers, and actively driving international tourism. Turning to BetMGM, in 2024, we will soon be live in 29 markets with the launch of North Carolina next month."", ""We had a noteworthy technology achievement in January with the approval and subsequent migration of the Entain platform in Nevada. This sets the stage for integration of single account, single wallet in Nevada later this spring, which is critical to our omnichannel thesis with fully unlock -- and will fully unlock one of the key differentiators for BetMGM by fully leveraging our Las Vegas properties. within our international digital space, in the U.K., LeoVegas BetMGM'S KPIs have exceeded our initial projections, demonstrating again the strength of MGM's brand. In fact, by leveraging the MGM Resorts balance sheet, we now offer the highest jackpot payouts among all competitors in the U.S., making our offers even that much more compelling."", 'Turning to our development pipeline, in Osaka, we successfully began liquefaction countermeasures in the fourth quarter, maintaining our trajectory to commence preparatory construction efforts in 2025, on time for 2030 opening. Additionally, in New York, the request for proposal process is currently underway. We anticipate submitting our full application to the government by the middle of this year with a decision expected shortly thereafter. Putting it all together, our company is in a great position to generate free cash flow through 2028.', ""We'll deploy this free cash strategically into development projects, such as Japan and New York. We'll reinvest in our existing portfolio through maintenance and growth capex, which we are specifically focused on enhancing and expanding our luxury-oriented offerings, and the repurchase of shares at attractive levels and investment which we believe will still continue to generate strong returns. Jonathan, over to you."", 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Bill. And before I dig into the financial results, I'd like to join Bill in thanking our employees at MGM Resorts for an outstanding quarter and a truly great year. While I certainly focus on our exceptional financial results, we accomplished that and so much more together. Our consolidated businesses in the fourth quarter generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 22% from last year, net income of $202 million, and adjusted EBITDAR of $1.2 billion."", ""During the quarter, net cash from operating activities was $716 million, and free cash flow was $387 million. It's important to note that $283 million in cash flow from operating activities and $18 million in capital expenditures related to MGM China, and they were included in the quarter. For the full year of 2023, free cash flow was $1.8 billion. In Las Vegas, same-store net revenues, which excludes Mirage from the prior-year period, was $2.4 billion, up 10% over last year."", ""On previous calls, we've talked about the fact that our operations in Las Vegas skew toward the high end with approximately 80% of our Strip adjusted property EBITDAR coming from our luxury properties. Interestingly, this year's revenues from our luxury properties increased mid-teens for the quarter and the year, representing approximately 90% of our absolute top-line growth, and this further highlights the prominence of the higher-end segments in our business here in Las Vegas. Same-store adjusted property EBITDAR increased 3% or $29 million year over year. Margins were about 36% in the quarter, well within our expected range in the mid-30s."", ""In the regions, same-store revenue, which excludes Gold Strike, was down 7% year over year with same-store adjusted property EBITDAR decreasing $64 million or 22%. It's important to note that approximately $60 million of the decrease year over year came from Detroit and National Harbor, where those properties were impacted by disruptions related to a strike and some high-end play not returning, respectively."", 'Andrew Chapman -- Director, Investor Relations', ""There was also some lingering cyber incident challenges that specifically impacted the regional portfolio, given that promotional offers were not available to our customers for the first half of October. Beyond these specific properties' circumstances in the fourth quarter, the regional property trends remained stable. As we look to drive future growth within our domestic portfolio, our centers of excellence and property leaders have identified opportunities to increase our share of customer spend and drive organic growth. We see plenty of both near-term and medium-term opportunities to enhance revenue preoccupied room night, even beyond the benefits of the Marriott partnership."", 'For example, adaptive pricing will maximize throughput within our high-demand outlets and will further enhance our ability to drive upsells and new product offerings. This includes bundled packages with room, show, and food and beverage offerings. We expect these initiatives to drive RevPAR growth in 2024. Improved segmentation will allow us to increase personalization and enhance the guest experience while driving increased NPS and overall customer lifetime value.', 'An omnichannel purchase behavior by our MGM Rewards members will be enhanced by a single account, single wallet in Nevada later this year. Once in action, our customers will be able to open an account here in Las Vegas and bring that wallet home to continue their experience with MGM Resorts, allowing us to drive targeted marketing and outreach to further cross-sell our digital and physical assets. Moving over to MGM China. Our record adjusted property EBITDAR of $262 million was a 42% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.', 'This was driven by casino revenue, which increased 31% versus the fourth quarter of 2019; and more specifically our main floor segment table games win, which increased 74% from 2019. Margins were in line with the first three quarters of the year at 27%. Market share was an all-time record in the fourth quarter at over 16%. And for the full year, our market share exceeded 15%, which is 600 basis points above our 2019 performance and 300 basis points above our table fair share.', 'On the digital side, BetMGM successfully met its 2023 targets by reporting positive EBITDA in the second half of the year and reaching the upper limit of its net revenue from operations guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. And let me close with -- as usual, with a brief walkthrough of our capital allocation strategy and our valuation. First off, we successfully closed on an amendment and extension of our senior secured credit facility this week. This expands our capacity by approximately $600 million to $2.3 billion and extends the maturity of that facility to 2029.', 'The commitment from our relationship banks allows us to sustain our financial policy of a minimum $3 billion in liquidity while deploying incremental cash for further high-return investments, including share repurchases. As Bill mentioned, we expect to fully fund the equity contribution in Japan and the commercial gaming expansion in New York with our free cash flow. Domestically, we intend to invest maintenance capital of approximately $600 million this year or 4% of revenue, which is consistent with our historical trend. Major maintenance capital projects this year focus on luxury-oriented offerings, examples being the remodeling of the Bellagio Tower Suites, The Cosmopolitan Chelsea Tower Penthouses, and the MGM Grand main tower rooms.', 'As of the end of 2023, we had liquidity of $4.5 billion when excluding MGM China. Excluding the cash that we keep on hand to operate our business and keeping with our policy, we have $1 billion in excess cash, which will be allocated to international digital acquisitions, high ROI capital projects, and share repurchases. We continue to see great value in our shares. And during the year, with a $2.3 billion repurchase of our shares, we reduced our share count by 14%.', 'To close, I would briefly like to discuss our enterprise valuation and why we still believe share repurchases are remunerative use of our capital. Consider the following. As of yesterday, our share price was $47, and we had 320 million shares outstanding. This equates to a market capitalization of %15.1 billion.', 'And if we add our quarter-end domestic net debt and subtract the market value of our 56% stake in MGM China and analyst consensus estimates for the value of our 50% of BetMGM, then we have the enterprise value of our operations, less China and BetMGM, of $10.6 billion. Divide this by our 2023 EBITDA adjusted for corporate expense, and we calculate an implied current trailing trading multiple of just 4.9 times. We think this multiple represents a discount to the value that we see in our future cash flows, which provides us further conviction in returning capital to shareholders by repurchasing our shares at these levels. Bill, back to you.', 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Jonathan. Before I open it up for questions, maybe just some general comments on the year, and you've heard me say this and use this word, resilient and luxury, a couple of times. If you think about, particularly this last quarter, we were on our heels with the cyberattack. You all understood what that did to us."", ""And so as we entered October, to think we'd end up having the quarter we had, I just -- I couldn't be prouder of the organization, and it particularly shone through in luxury. Bellagio after 25 years had its best quarter in its history and its best year in its history. And so it does prove that in continuing to invest in these properties in the right place at the right time does make a difference, and so we're very excited by thinking about that as we continue to go forward. I think about what happened with BetMGM and ultimately our database, MGM Rewards database now is over 44 million participants, driven by BetMGM, and ultimately, the omnichannel effect of that long term will begin, we think, to pay dividends."", ""Macau is doing amazingly well. I know some of our competitors are wondering what we're doing. Kenny and the team broke through 20% in the month of January for market share. I'm not suggesting that's sustainable, but I will tell you, I think we have repositioned those two properties, and we're prepared to compete on an equal basis with anybody in the marketplace."", ""When I think about BetMGM, the original goal five years ago was to get into the top three because we thought it mattered, and we have. We realize there's focus on product. There's some things we need to do to maintain and keep market share, and we think moves by that team with Angstrom and other things have done that for us. We realize particularly this quarter there's pressure on regional margins."", ""We know what they did. But remember what Jonathan said, $60 million of the $64 million was tied to two events, the Detroit strike, and ultimately, a player in our National Harbor company didn't come back year over year. We find ourselves with one of the best balance sheets in the industry, which well positions us to invest in places like Japan and New York. We are looking aggressively at the UAE, and Gary Fritz and the digital team has constant things in front of us in terms of growing the balance of our worldwide digital business, and so we're excited by all of that."", ""And then obviously, if, again, you follow Jonathan's math, like every CEO, we think we're under traded at 4.9 times, but obviously, you all will be the judge of that. So with that operator, I will open it up for questions."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you very much. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'Joe Greff -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Good afternoon, everybody. Starting off with the Las Vegas, Bill, Jonathan, and whoever else is in the room there, can you talk about maybe isolating in the fourth quarter the EBITDA contribution from F1? And then you might be still counting the money from the Super Bowl, but do you think the Super Bowl event in Las Vegas is of a larger magnitude than what the EBITDA contribution from F1 was in the fourth quarter? And then sticking to the topic of F1, Bill, you mentioned about that maybe had a better price F1 this year and in coming years. Do you think year two can be bigger than year one? Or does it have to level off before it can grow?', 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Let me give some broad stroke, and then Corey and Jonathan can both kick in. Look, F1, when you balance it out year over year was a $50 million to a $70 million. It was actually a $70 million increase year over year. But if I neutralize the year before, it's about $50 million."", ""We didn't run lucky the year before. Super Bowl was amazing. It did -- we were always concerned. We do great Super Bowl parties here."", 'Will it be the kind of event that will drive, given the additional expense of the tickets, etc., etc.? The answer was, hands down, yes, and particularly rooms, and it drove them across the board. Unlike where F1 was isolated to our premium properties, Super Bowl drove it across the board. We had thousands of people in all of our ballrooms in the MGM Grand Garden enjoying the game and enjoying the festivities, and so it was a really successful universal event. Las Vegas showed up, and I think we all did a tremendous job hosting it.', ""And where I was skeptical going in, I would look to clearly want to host this again. I think on pricing, when it comes to Formula 1, we're going to be more cautious of some of the outlier properties that we have. We got paid for Bellagio, ARIA, or Cosmopolitan along the track, and we got paid well. I think if you go further away you got from the track with a couple of exceptions, MGM held in there well because of its adjacency to the paddock, there's opportunity to do that better and get more people back into the town."", ""What I would add, Joe, on F1, in particular, the South Strip, in particular, we would treat that probably more like a normal weekend going forward because of the lack of activation there. So we think there's opportunity there. And on Super Bowl, I mean, every cash register from food and beverage to entertainment was ringing, so it was much more widespread at every property compared to F1, which was isolated to the luxury."", 'Joe Greff -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Great. And, Bill, this is a good chance for you to revisit any updated thinking and the board's thinking on any kind of large-scale digital M&A. Has anything really changed or evolved since the last time you made public commentary on it?"", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""No. Look, I was at ICE last week. I met with Stella, our partner. We're still very focused on making sure everyone's focus is on BetMGM."", ""And particularly, this is a critical year, I think, for all of us. So it's about product, product, products, and focus. And so that remains the focus for now."", 'Joe Greff -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.', 'Carlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys. Thank you. And I respect that you've talked about this previously. And not really breaking out kind of impacts from hold, but clearly, in Las Vegas, in the third and fourth quarter, you've experienced much higher than, at least what we're accustomed to, hold percentages."", ""And I was wondering if, a, you could perhaps provide some impact in the fourth quarter in Las Vegas from the hold; and, b, maybe just talk about more quantitatively what's driving it and how sustainable or what you would think if you had to go back and do it again normalize hold is in the current environment."", 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Hey, Carlo. It's Jonathan. Yeah, we've tried to get out of the business of quantifying hold impacts because, as you know, there's a lot of things that cut both ways when trying to isolate the impact of hold. It's certainly true that we experienced good hold in the fourth quarter, but I would also say that, first of all, with this customer segment that drove some of those results, the nature of the play is such that it can lead to higher hold anyway."", ""So the whole idea of what a normal hold is is a little bit different. And then second of all, there are expenses associated with these customer segments, including, of course, the normal complementarities, as well as in certain cases discounts, in order to induce more rapid retirement of markers and the like. But, look, it was -- it positively contributed to the results. There's no question about that, and -- but I would also highlight that there were offsets to that, including player-related expenses, as well as some other things we incurred in the quarter."", 'Carlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""OK, good enough. I appreciate that, Jonathan. And then just one follow-up on Macau and perhaps kind of how you're thinking about things there. Obviously, the results are very good."", ""The market share results continue to be very good, but the flowthrough in the period was -- if we look at it on a sequential basis was a little lower, and I'm wondering if that has anything to do with -- which is kind of expenses that you're incurring or if it's concession-related programing, things of that nature. If you can give some color on how we should think about 2024 through the context of flowthrough and top-line growth."", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Let me kick it off. Kenny, I'll turn it over to you. Some of it is simple activity case. To your point, I mean, we have done like all the operatives, a good job going after some of the -- and I'll use our concert that we just had is a great example of an expense in an overhead item, but to drive overall tourism with Bruno Mars, etc."", ""So part of it's adhering to that. Kenny, why don't you give some more color, though?"", 'Kenneth Fang -- President and Executive Director, MGM China', ""Yeah, thanks for the question. Actually, as you can see, Q4 was a record high in MGM China's history. We are happy to see our January performance is continued to grow. So actually, our January performance has exceeded even October levels across all segments, including EBITDA and market share."", ""Currently, we are in the middle of Chinese New Year or -- basically which has about eight days' celebration to the city as to MGM -- as to the visitation to the city has reached about 90%, 95% of 2019 same period levels. As to MGM China, two properties combined, the visitation, the players count, the table drop, the slot handle, as well as the VIP turnover, have all well exceeded 2019 same period levels. So we are confident and we are optimistic with the Chinese New Year, as well as the rest of this quarter."", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""And, Kenny, I think I might add -- Kenny, I just might add, look, contras are growing as our high volume continues to increase because, again, that's on us versus a junket operative in the middle of that. And I remind everybody on our margins, in particular, we do not -- I wish we did, but we do not have a large retail segment, which, obviously, there's a massive amount of flowthrough if you're making $100 million a year in rent, which I know some of our competitors are. The flowthrough on that is a lot. We don't have that luxury, so it does impact some of our margins."", 'Carlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Absolutely. Sorry, because you mentioned it in terms of the contra revenues. It looks like they were 21%, 22% at each of the properties, respectively, in the period. Is that kind of a level that you expect to maintain as long as business mix as it stands today maintain?', 'Kenneth Fang -- President and Executive Director, MGM China', ""Yes, that's right. We are pretty -- we are -- the reinvestment rate actually is pretty flat over the quarters for the past year."", 'Carlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thank you, all.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.', 'David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good evening, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. I want to just go back to BetMGM. Obviously, there is a keen focus on product in 2024 as it's been in 2023."", 'Should we still think about 2024 as more of an investment year for that entity and if 2025 is one where we can start to sort of realize some profits? If you could just talk through the puts and takes for what might cause that trajectory to change this year, next year, that would be helpful.', 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure, David. I'll take that. Look, I think the answer is yes, you're spot-on. This will be a reinvestment year."", ""Obviously, you've seen we've lost share, literally, in both instances. And the two folks that sit above us were being outspent 2, 2.5-1 in terms of raw marketing spend in dollars. We want and need to get our product in a better and different shape. We want more parlays."", ""Obviously, the acquisition of Angstrom by our partner will be a big add to that. We'll be able to stick out more product. We'll have more confidence in it. Speed to market will be better, etc."", ""And so that's part of what will be developed, starting with baseball this year. We hope by the time we hit football next year, a lot of the product differentiators we hope to have will be in play. We hope to have a single wallet in play, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, this spring here. But ultimately, a development year this year, begin to see making some cash next year."", ""And I'm suggesting that by 2026, we're going to have a very strong first year of -- this is where this business is going and should be."", 'David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""And, look, it'd be silly for me to ask, as my follow-up, will you or won't you, and so I'm not. But if you could just help us frame out the puts and takes around whether BetMGM could at some point -- or how it thinks about controlling that entity and being able to drive the trajectory of that product advancement that makes perfect sense, that would be helpful. So it's obviously a matter that's discussed pretty actively."", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""David, I would only echo what I said. Look, with Stella as the interim CEO, the focus on the team for product for BetMGM is the focus. I don't want to comment on any other further discussion with them at this point. I don't think it'd be prudent."", 'David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'I understand. I appreciate it. I hope you can allow me to ask it. Thanks.', 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Stephen Grambling -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Hi. Just thinking about Vegas into 2024, do you generally think of this year as being more of a lodging and F&B year versus a gaming year? And in that context, how should we think about opex per-day growth in Vegas specifically in the year? What are the major puts and takes to think through?', 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Actually, I think that's probably a good way to characterize it. When we look at the drivers of growth this year, and we've talked about a few of them already, a lot of it relates to yielding, pricing, of course, growing demand through this new Marriott partnership, and so on."", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Conventions.', 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, and the conventions business. Thank you, Bill. So those are going to be the main drivers of top-line growth. As it relates to opex, while, of course, we don't provide guidance for either the top line or the bottom line, we are looking at increases, the main increases associated with our new labor agreement here in Las Vegas with a culinary union."", ""So that will be at least a year-over-year factor for the first half of the year, not really in the back half of the year since we already incurred that in the last six months of the year. That will be the main issue for us. We'll be able to offset that, in part, through some work we're doing around productivity, as well as improvement in cost of sales through leverage procurement activities. But I think kind of a low- to mid-single-digit opex growth rate, I wouldn't be surprised if we incur that this year."", 'Stephen Grambling -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""And then maybe one other follow-up just on the buyback, I guess, how do you think through the pace that we should be anticipating this year? And what's kind of the upper bound in terms of leverage that you should be thinking through?"", 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', ""The upper bound of leverage would be 4.5 times lease-adjusted leverage, and we're a full turn below that right now. I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we retired 14% of our outstanding shares last year. It may have been our largest share repurchase year to date. I wouldn't anticipate continuing at that pace this year, but we're still active in the market."", ""We still think that the shares are attractively valued, and we still have a fair amount of dry powder, just augmented with our revolving credit increase, to enable us to do that. So I would say it's likely going to be less than it was in 2023, but we're still being aggressive."", 'Stephen Grambling -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.', 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to drill in a little bit just in the fourth quarter in Las Vegas. I think your same-store revenues were up about 10%, margins down a couple of hundred basis points. I know there's a lot of moving pieces in there in accruals and maybe some cyber impact and hold but hoping maybe you could just parse that out as it would be helpful for us to think about that 2024 opex guide you mentioned."", 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. When we kind of parse it out, accounting for unusual items or things that we wouldn't expect to recur, we think that the margin in the fourth quarter in Las Vegas was maybe benefited by about 100 basis points. So that still puts us right in the mid-30s, which is where we've kind of expected the margins to be for some time. That's where we expect them to be for 2024."", 'Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess more broadly on Las Vegas as we think about kind of the remainder of the year, I think March, you have CON/AGG rolling off, March Madness, but you have group, as you mentioned, kind of pacing better. How should we think about kind of baking it all in in terms of an expectation for growth or any major tent-pole events to kind of call out for the remainder of the year that we should get excited about?"", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""We've got just top line. Off the top of my head, Madonna's coming, Springsteen's coming, The Stones are coming, to name three. We've got a great football kickoff with USC, LSU coming. To your point, obviously, March Madness is always a big deal around here."", ""And then Formula 1 rolls back around again. We are going to miss the Pac-12 championship next year. No, we've got one more year, I take that back, so we won't miss that. And so we all must admit, 2023, and if you think about the recent stretch we've just been through, was an amazing year and an amazing stretch."", ""So replicating that won't be easy. But having said that, we still have plenty of content and activity case that kind of fill the void and fill the dates."", 'Corey Sanders -- Chief Operating Officer', ""And from a city perspective, I think the Sphere has been a great addition. The T-Mobile will be programmed more than it was last year. So all in all, I think it's going to be a really strong year. As you think about March, it won't only be CON/AGG."", 'We also have Easter ending in March. So that will have a slight impact in March on the convention business but will be picked up in April.', 'Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thanks so much for all the help.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just sticking with Las Vegas for a moment.', ""Bill, you called out a lot of great commentary and color around the high end. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on maybe those core properties kind of outside the high end. What are you seeing on the customer behavior side? What's going to take to drive some growth and improvement at some of those properties as you look out to 2024?"", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, I'll tell you one thing, and Corey can pick this up. But the flowthrough or the spill-off, I should say, from the 100,000 more room nights principally at Mandalay for conference and convention business does flow into Luxor with setup crews, pieces and parts of these various groups, even in the Excalibur, so I think that's an opportunistic thing. Obviously, whether it's resort fees on through, we've gone through with a pricing exercise. We'll continue to do that to try to recapture, particularly the culinary increase, which we all know this year is going to be an extensive one."", 'Then it falls off and basically flattens out for the balance of the 4.5 years. So, Corey, anything?', 'Corey Sanders -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Yes. The legacy properties, the growth is going to be a little bit limited there. It's a small percent of our Vegas revenue. As Bill mentioned, the convention mix, not just here but in town, in citywide, will help some overflow there."", ""but it definitely won't have the same benefits that the luxury properties are and will see."", 'Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks. And just as my follow-up, I think it was called out in the prepared remarks, but $1 billion earmarked across a variety of things, including international, digital. Just help us think through what some of the criteria would be there.', ""I mean, again, I know a lot of eyeballs are focused on something more transformative with your partner, but it sounds like this is more along the lines of what you've done with LeoVegas. So maybe just give us some parameters of what could check some boxes for you in terms of that opportunity looking out for this year or next."", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. We contemplated four key pillars to getting and setting up our own shop, if you will. And so we bought LeoVegas with that in mind. We've obviously now gone and bought Push Gaming, which is a content studio."", ""By the way, their first game, MGM Millions, or MGM Money Millions, whatever it's called, No. 1 game on our network, No. 1, first game out, branded with MGM. We are on the heels of buying Sports Technology."", ""We want to obviously be in our own sports betting business with our own technology. And over time, we have Kambi that we use for LeoVegas. We are on the heels of a deal for Live Dealer where we've talked about and had a vision of broadcasting live games from Las Vegas to rest of world with some celebrities and entertainment tied to them, and we're on the heels of that. I'm heading down to South America next week or the week after to look at a large JV."", ""Brazil is going to put Internet gaming in play for both casino and sports betting, and we plan to be there when that launches. And so we're focused on building that business at its core into a real business. We've taken BetMGM U.K., as we've talked about. We've got well over 100,000 first-time depositors already in the four-and-a-half short months, and we're looking at another country already to do the same thing."", ""And so we're going to grow the business.

Please go ahead.', 'Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Hi. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So just first wanted to circle back to Macau and ask Carlo's question in a little bit of a different way."", ""If we just look at sort of opex, excluding gaming taxes, for the fourth quarter, that number did step up a little bit. And I'm just curious, if you look at that on maybe a per-day basis versus '19 or however you look at that. Is there one-time maybe events-related opex in that quarter? And what I'm really getting at is if you guys think we should be thinking about that sort of level as a run rate going forward."", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Kenny, maybe you could speak to this more intelligently, but I can tell you, broad stroke, remember, the requirement we have. We have to spend $1.1 billion in 10-year commitment in opex-driving tourism, and there's about $900 million or so in actual capital expense. So we've got a little over $2 billion commitment to the government, of which the $1.1 billion is pure opex. And so a lot of the activity case in driving international tourism, and driving tourism isn't necessarily tied to the usual marketing programs that we'd think about in gaming."", 'Kenneth Fang -- President and Executive Director, MGM China', 'OK. This is Kenny. As you know, for the past year, with the new concession, we added another 200 tables. Of course, we added a little bit more FTEs.', 'We have more daily table open hours. But in general, we are very, very tight regarding our opex control. You can see from our EBITDA margin, over the quarters of the last year, we are very stable, in the high 20s, along with our market share gains and the business growth. As Bill just commented, we do not have so much high-margin retail rental EBITDA, but our gaming EBITDA margin is really way up there in this marketplace.', 'I can see for the next -- for these next couple of quarters, we should be quite stable with our margins.', 'Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""OK. That's perfect. Thanks for that. And then circling back on digital and BetMGM specifically, I was wondering, Bill, if you want to comment at all on the sort of newly announced partnership with X, what you can say about how that deal came together, the structure of the deal, and anything from an economic standpoint that you can share and then what you expect the impact to be over time."", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Look, it's interesting. It just started, as you know, so we have high hopes for it. We had literally 100 million people, when they flipped on X yesterday, day before, are going to be exposed to that offering and that opportunity. That team is probably much better positioned to give you some input on what they think the outcome is going to be."", ""I can remember from the various presentations that if you captured about 0.1% of those folks, it was a significant uptick to the company, and it's efficient. The way we've structured this deal compared to other even general bonusing, it's an extremely efficient deal for us. So we'll see. Our customers live there."", 'But everyone was on X, I guess, but we particularly think the demographic fits well for what we do.', 'Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Great.

So, a, maybe if you're willing to kind of touch on that, given that many of your properties are in these areas that may have inclement weather in January.

Or does it still feel as good as you kind of look out to '24? Thanks."", 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yes. I would say that certain of our properties were affected by the weather. Springfield comes to mind as one.

I have to believe, in the next 30 to 60 days, we should find out more. I've been shown three versions of it now in terms of where it will actually sit on the site and how it will connect.

So we talked a lot about the performance at your high-end properties in Las Vegas.', ""I'm curious if you see similar trends or consumer trends at your regional properties. Is it the high end and high tiers of the database that are driving performance there as well? Or might the business mix be a little bit more balanced? And realizing regionals have the same event draw that Vegas does, but curious if you have kind of a view on the segments of the database from a consumer perspective."", 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. It's Jonathan. I'll offer a couple of comments. The answer is yes but really for different reasons."", ""In the regional markets, I think, as Corey mentioned, we've really directed our marketing efforts, and to a certain extent, the property amenities themselves, to higher-worth guests. We've reduced our marketing investments and promotional investments on the lower end, and that really started in the aftermath of the pandemic, and it's carried forward. So the fact is that the increases that we've seen in those regional properties are really predominantly from the higher average daily worth customers. But I say it's the same effect for different reasons because in Las Vegas, what has been really driving this has been our special events, our focus on these customers through our branch offices, and our own marketing efforts."", 'And obviously, the citywide events that are going on have skewed more toward that high-end luxury growth, as well as our capital investment in our luxury properties, so same effect for different reasons.', 'John DeCree -- CBRE Group -- Analyst', 'Thanks, Jonathan. I appreciate that color. And then maybe quickly on the growth capex plan this year. I think you listed a couple of the projects that go into that bucket, and you guys have this dialed in pretty tight by now.', 'But is there anything that we should think about in terms of disruption? Are any of those projects large enough or the timing of such that we might want to think about any disruption at the assets?', 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I would say no. I've been at MGM for three years, and I've been amazed at our operator's ability to manage through disruption and room renovations, as well as on the casino floor, but mainly in the room renovations if you think what we've done just in the last year or so with New York-New York, the spa tower, The Water Club, the Borgata, etc. This year, we have, the ones I mentioned, Chelsea suites, we're starting in the MGM Grand and so on, and also in the Bellagio main tower suites. So no, I would not advise you to really incorporate any disruption from those investments."", 'John DeCree -- CBRE Group -- Analyst', ""Great. That's my picture. Thanks, Jonathan. Appreciate the color."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please go ahead.', 'Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', 'Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So real quickly, just two quick questions for me. But when we think about margins in the regional markets, look, I understand there was a material impact in the fourth quarter from the strikes and the customer at National Harbor.', 'But, Jonathan, maybe just how are you guys thinking about the way margins could look for this year?', 'Jonathan Halkyard -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. There were a lot of things going on this quarter. I would say that we can do 30% margins in the regions. We do have a number of tools at our disposal, but we're also facing some labor cost increases there."", ""But when we do the forensics on the fourth quarter and look ahead to this year, we believe that that's achievable."", 'Corey Sanders -- Chief Operating Officer', ""And in the regionals, especially fourth quarter, because of weather, and it's a little slower. You'll have a little bit lower margin in the fourth quarter, but 30% for the year is attainable."", 'Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', ""OK, great. Thanks. And then, Bill and Jonathan, you've given us a lot of color around the gives and takes for this year in Vegas. So without getting too much into guidance, I'm going to try to ask this question and see if I'll get an answer out of you."", ""But I guess the simple question is do you think it's actually possible to grow full-year EBITDA this year? Are the overall comparisons, the hold comparison, is just going to be too tough to overcome?"", 'Bill Hornbuckle -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""No. Look, I think the answer is yes. I think we've budgeted to that. We've convinced our board of that."", ""We're incentivized to do that. And I think the answer is yes. Obviously, '23 was an amazing year. We've got some headwinds with particularly labor costs."", ""But there's enough programming out there, enough momentum that, in macro, we think we surpass. And so it's not going to be like double digit, I can assure you, but I think we surpass."", 'Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', 'OK, great. Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session.

I mentioned this word earlier, again, resiliency our troops have demonstrated, so I again want to thank them.', ""'23 was an incredible year. We had an all-time EBITDA year, seven of our properties continue to break records, and so we're anxious for the future. Macau is well-positioned. We've ended up in a great space in digital, and we're in the game for real for the long haul, and so you'll see us continue to do that."", ""And we launched our own digital brand and business in rest of world, and so excited by it, excited by the balance sheet and the development opportunities. Remember, in '23, Japan came our way, which is one and only and a very unique thing for the company in the long term.

To provide network operators a terrestrial alternative for distributing very accurate time, Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces the new TimeProvider® 4500 grandmaster, a hardware timekeeping platform that provides high-speed network interfaces up to 25 Gbps and enables precise time accuracy of less than one nanosecond.', 'The TimeProvider 4500 grandmaster is capable of supporting very-high-capacity Precision Time Protocol (PTP) transactions. The innovative hardware platform enables higher IEEE-1588 scalability for thousands of clients. In network locations where range and capacity need to be balanced, namely in C-band 5G deployments, it is critical to be able to serve thousands of gNodeB from a single grandmaster. Depending on the specific sites, the grandmaster could serve very few or a large number of gNodeB base stations. This results in cost-effective and flexible deployments for operators regardless of scale.', 'The TimeProvider 4500 grandmaster offers the flexibility to connect to various generations of network elements, which helps to preserve operators’ infrastructure investments. The TimeProvider 4500 clock is the first 1588 grandmaster with 25 Gbps support. A customer can connect the TimeProvider 4500 clock to various network devices using a choice of 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps or 25 Gbps network links. High-speed bandwidth is essential as network element upgrades are migrating towards equipment that requires a minimum of 10 Gbps and, in some cases, up to 100 Gbps.', 'The extremely high time accuracy of the TimeProvider 4500 grandmaster is particularly important as operators are trying to deploy alternative solutions to GNSS. A terrestrial option is often considered an attractive solution that can leverage existing optical network deployments to avoid the reliance on GNSS, thus providing a cost-effective way of transferring highly accurate time over long distances. The need for long-distance transfers translates into a requirement for ever- increasing accuracy needs at the source and regeneration of the time signal.', 'The TimeProvider 4500 grandmaster features new hardware assist enhancements, such as the latest generation of digital synthesizer and Microchip’s PolarFire® SoC FPGA. These platform enhancements enable the system to move into the picosecond time accuracy realm.', '“Microchip continues to develop new and innovative time and frequency solutions for critical infrastructure.\xa0We designed the TimeProvider 4500 clock to deliver tighter timing accuracy on existing optical network environments without the need for costly upgrades or dedicated dark fiber,” said Randy Brudzinski, vice president of Microchip’s frequency and time systems business unit. “This solution is also the first grandmaster with high-speed data processing up to 25 Gbps, enabling connectivity with the newest network elements in deployments.”', 'The advanced hardware platform of the TimeProvider 4500 clock supports all the features of the TimeProvider 4100 clock to ensure that operators deploying the new product can also benefit from their investments in the TimeProvider 4100 series. TP4500 adds specific capabilities above and beyond TP4100 due to its enhanced hardware platform.', 'The TimeProvider 4500 grandmaster is integrated with the TimePictra® synchronization management solution that enables operators to monitor and track real-time troubles and threats with visibility across their entire network. Other key functions of the TimePictra platform include comprehensive Fault, Configuration, Accounting (Inventory), Performance and Security (FCAPS) management functions; geographical topology and domain navigation; user preference dashboard customization, intuitive web GUI for easy management and more.', 'The TimeProvider 4500 series is the newest product to join Microchip’s portfolio of IEEE-1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) grandmaster clocks, which provide industry-leading performance and value. These field-proven solutions scale from low-density indoor applications to high-capacity 5G network timing requirements.', 'Pricing and Availability', 'The TimeProvider 4500 grandmaster is now available for purchase.

The formula for this calculation on Microchip Technology is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.25 = US$3.2b ÷ (US$16b - US$3.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Thus, Microchip Technology has an ROCE of 25%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 10%."", ' View our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', ""In the above chart we have measured Microchip Technology's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Microchip Technology here  for free."", ""Microchip Technology has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, returns on capital have grown by 291%. The company is now earning US$0.2 per dollar of capital employed. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 27% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. A business that's shrinking its asset base like this isn't usually typical of a soon to be multi-bagger company."", 'On a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. The current liabilities has increased to 20% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. Keep an eye out for future increases because when the ratio of current liabilities to total assets gets particularly high, this can introduce some new risks for the business.', ""From what we've seen above, Microchip Technology has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. Since the stock has returned a solid 94% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Microchip Technology can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead."", 'Microchip Technology does have some risks, we noticed   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.', 'High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.', 'Have feedback on this article?

I really like seeing the passive income from those payments flow into my portfolio, giving me more cash to buy shares of companies that pay dividends. I believe my love of dividends will pay off by eventually supplying enough passive income so I can comfortably retire.', ""While I own lots of dividend stocks, Realty Income (NYSE: O), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC) (NYSE: BIP), and Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN) (NYSE: CWEN.A) are three of my favorites. Here's why other dividend lovers will love these stocks too."", 'Realty Income has lavished dividends on its investors over the years. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has made 643 monthly dividend payments throughout its history. It has increased its dividend payment 123 times since going public in 1994, including for the last 105 straight quarters, growing its payout at a 4.3% compound annual rate. ', ""The REIT expects to continue growing its attractive dividend (currently yielding 5.8%). It's targeting to grow its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by 4% to 5% per share over the long term. Given its already conservative dividend payout ratio (75.1% of its adjusted FFO in the third quarter) and fortress-like balance sheet, it should be able to grow its dividend at or above the low end of that rate. The company's strong financial profile allows it to continue acquiring income-producing properties. "", 'Realty Income has already closed two notable deals this year. It bought fellow REIT Spirit Realty in a $9.3 billion deal. That transaction will increase its adjusted FFO by more than 2.5% per share this year. Meanwhile, it recently bought a portfolio of retail properties from Decathlon for over $500 million. These and future acquisitions will grow its adjusted FFO, enabling the REIT to continue increasing its dividend. ', ""Brookfield Infrastructure recently announced its 15th consecutive annual dividend increase. The global infrastructure operator boosted its payout by another 6%. Over the past decade, it has grown its payout at an 8% compound annual rate. Brookfield's dividend now yields an enticing 4.4%. "", 'The company plans to increase its payout at a 5% to 9% annual rate over the long term. It has plenty of power to achieve that plan. It has a trio of organic growth drivers (rates indexed to inflation, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects) that should drive 6% to 9% annual FFO-per-share growth. ', ""Brookfield believes acquisitions could drive even faster FFO-per-share growth. For example, it grew its FFO by 10% in 2023, 8% organically, and the other 2% fueled by new investments. Acquisitions could provide an even bigger boost this year, given the timing of last year's deals (it closed $2 billion in the third and fourth quarters, partially offset by $1.9 billion of asset sales in the second quarter). "", ""Meanwhile, it has lined up two more deals for this year. It's buying some data centers out of bankruptcy and a portfolio of cell towers in India from American Tower. These and future new investments will give the company even more power to increase its dividend."", 'Clearway Energy expects to grow its already alluring dividend (6.8% yield) toward the upper end of its 5% to 8% annual target range through 2026. The renewable energy producer has already locked in the growth it needs to deliver on the plan. ', 'The main power source is its capital recycling strategy. Clearway cashed in on the value of its thermal assets in 2022, netting over $1.3 billion in cash proceeds. It has found deals to redeploy that cash into higher-returning renewable energy investments. Those investments will grow its cash flow, enabling it to increase its dividend. The company expects its cash available for distribution to rise from $330 million-$360 million last year to $435 million once it closes all the new investments it has secured. ', 'Meanwhile, Clearway Energy has plenty of power to continue growing its payout beyond 2026. Recent contract renewals for its natural gas power plant portfolio are coming in at a high enough rate that these agreements alone could support dividend growth at the low end of its target range in 2027. On top of that, the company has the financial flexibility to continue acquiring new renewable energy projects as opportunities arise. ', 'Realty Income, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Clearway Energy offer dividend lovers the two things they love most: high yields and visible growth. They currently offer yields several times above the S&P 500 (1.4%) and expect to grow those payouts at a single-digit annual rate. That combination should also enable these stocks to produce compelling total annualized returns that could reach double digits. This makes them great stocks for dividend lovers to buy right now.

While tech stocks seemed to take the spotlight last year, it doesn’t necessarily indicate the downfall of dividend stocks, which have long held their allure. As we progress through 2024, the stock and bond market outlook fluctuates regularly, influenced by economic updates, statements from the Federal Reserve, and shifts in interest rate expectations. Initially, investors anticipated multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, with expectations of the first cut in March. However, following a series of positive economic indicators, the Fed has hinted that a rate cut in March is improbable. Consequently, investors are adjusting their valuations of stocks and bonds, awaiting fewer rate cuts to commence later than previously projected. During uncertain times, it's recommended for investors to focus on dividend stocks. These stocks typically offer good value and can provide consistent income, especially in sectors where there's potential for growth in stock prices."", ""Analysts' preference for dividend stocks isn't a recent trend; it's largely based on the historical performance of these stocks. Companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time have proven to be reliable investments, delivering strong returns in the past. These stocks have been particularly resilient during periods of high inflation. For instance, the S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index, which tracks companies in the S&P 500 known for consistent or increasing dividends and high forecast dividend yield growth, saw its dividends grow at an annual rate of 13.8% from 2010 to 2022, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices. This growth rate has surpassed the long-term U.S. inflation rate, even amidst recent spikes in inflation over the past few years. The report also noted that historical data comparing the performance of the S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index to the S&P 500 indicated that the index has displayed somewhat defensive traits, with a downside capture ratio of 94.5%. Additionally, over time, the index has typically captured 96% of the market's returns during upward market trends."", 'As previously mentioned, dividend stocks took a backseat during the tech surge in 2023, but reliable dividend-paying companies are poised for a strong resurgence.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward.

GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with FE.', ""On February 13, 2024, FirstEnergy Corp (NYSE:FE), an investor-owned holding company with a significant footprint in the electric utility industry, filed its 10-K with the SEC. This SWOT analysis delves into the intricacies of the filing, providing a financial overview and a strategic evaluation of the company's position. With a regulated distribution network across six states and one of the largest electric transmission systems in the nation, FirstEnergy serves over six million customers. The financial tables from the filing reveal a company with a solid base of regulated electric generation capacity and a commitment to meeting the electricity demands of its service territories. As we dissect the filing, we will explore the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape FirstEnergy's operational and financial landscape."", ""Regulated Distribution and Transmission System: FirstEnergy's regulated distribution segment, which distributes electricity through its utility operating companies, is a cornerstone of its strength. The company controls 3,580 MWs of regulated electric generation capacity, primarily in West Virginia and Virginia. This capacity, coupled with a vast transmission system of over 24,000 miles, positions FirstEnergy as a key player in the regions it serves. The company's ability to reliably deliver power under state-regulated rate tariffs solidifies its market presence and provides a stable revenue stream."", ""Human Capital and Safety Initiatives: FirstEnergy places a high emphasis on human capital, with a workforce of 12,042 employees, approximately 45% of whom are represented by unions. The company's focus on safety, diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and workplace flexibility demonstrates its commitment to fostering a positive work environment. These initiatives not only enhance employee engagement and satisfaction but also contribute to operational efficiency and a strong corporate culture, which are critical assets in a competitive industry."", ""Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: The 10-K filing highlights supply chain vulnerabilities that have emerged in the post-pandemic economy, with increased lead times and costs due to labor shortages and raw material availability. While FirstEnergy has taken steps to mitigate these risks, such as expanding its supply base and enhancing demand management, the potential for prolonged disruptions could adversely affect the company's operations, cash flow, and financial condition. This weakness underscores the need for continued strategic planning to navigate an uncertain supply chain landscape."", ""Competition in Transmission Projects: FirstEnergy faces competition for transmission projects within the PJM Region due to FERC's Order No. 1000, which allows non-incumbent developers to compete for certain projects. This regulatory change introduces a new competitive dynamic that could impact FirstEnergy's ability to secure future transmission projects, potentially affecting its growth trajectory and market share in the transmission sector."", ""Strategic Cybersecurity Enhancements: FirstEnergy's comprehensive cybersecurity program, aligned with national standards, represents a significant opportunity to strengthen its market position. The company's multi-layered governance structure, regular risk assessments, and third-party security partnerships are proactive measures that not only protect against cyber threats but also build trust with customers and stakeholders. As cyber threats continue to evolve, FirstEnergy's strategic focus on cybersecurity can serve as a differentiator in the industry."", 'Advancements in DEI and Employee Development: The company\'s initiatives to promote DEI and employee development are opportunities to attract and retain top talent. By enhancing transparency in DEI data, improving talent processes, and offering programs like ""Educate to Elevate,"" FirstEnergy is positioning itself as an employer of choice. These efforts can lead to a more innovative, responsive, and customer-focused organization.', ""Environmental Regulation Impact: Increased environmental regulations pose a threat to FirstEnergy's fuel supply and operational costs. The company's reliance on coal contracts and emission allowances necessitates careful management to meet regulatory requirements. Changes in environmental policies could lead to additional compliance costs or operational constraints, impacting profitability and strategic flexibility."", ""Seasonality and Weather Patterns: The seasonal nature of the electric power industry, with peak demand during summer and winter, exposes FirstEnergy to weather-related risks. Unpredictable weather patterns can result in fluctuating power sales, revenues, and cash flow. This threat highlights the importance of strategic planning and operational resilience to mitigate the impact of mild weather conditions on the company's financial performance."", 'In conclusion, FirstEnergy Corp (NYSE:FE) exhibits a strong market presence through its regulated distribution and transmission system, bolstered by a focus on human capital and safety. However, supply chain vulnerabilities and competition in transmission projects present challenges that require strategic attention. Opportunities for growth lie in cybersecurity enhancements and employee development initiatives. Meanwhile, environmental regulations and the inherent seasonality of the industry pose ongoing threats. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, FirstEnergy can capitalize on opportunities and navigate threats in the evolving electric utility landscape.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Salesforce ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Salesforce had debt of US$9.43b at the end of October 2023, a reduction from US$10.6b over a year. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$11.9b in cash, so it actually has US$2.44b net cash.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Salesforce had liabilities of US$19.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$13.5b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$11.9b and US$4.85b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$16.2b.', ""Since publicly traded Salesforce shares are worth a very impressive total of US$272.2b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Salesforce boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!"", ""Better yet, Salesforce grew its EBIT by 984% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Salesforce's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. While Salesforce has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Salesforce actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert."", ""While it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Salesforce has US$2.44b in net cash. The cherry on top was that in converted 290% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$8.8b. So is Salesforce's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Salesforce that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Flowserve would post earnings of $0.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.50, delivering a surprise of +21.95%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors.

I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. I'll now turn the call over to Rob."", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Thanks, Shivani. Good morning, and thanks to everybody for joining today's call. We're here from a snowy New York City. I'm going to start with some highlights from 2023 and then discuss our expectations for 2024. And after my prepared remarks, Steve Tulenko, who's the President of Moody's Analytics; and Mike West, the President of Moody's Investor Service, will be joining me, along with Caroline Sullivan, our Interim CFO, for the Q&A portion of the call. And before we get into it, I have some very exciting news. As you may have seen this morning, we announced the appointment of Noémie Heuland as our new Chief Financial Officer, and she's reporting directly to me. And Noémie brings a wealth of knowledge to Moody's after nearly 25 years in senior roles at global public companies, including most recently as CFO of Dayforce, formerly Ceridian, and over a decade with global enterprise application software provider, SAP, during which it transitioned to a global software as a service business model. So as CFO, she's going to lead the global finance organization that includes accounting and controllership, financial planning and analysis, financial systems, investor relations, strategic sourcing and procurement and tax and treasury. And her firsthand experience in scaling high-growth, category-leading public software companies, along with her extensive global experience, I think, really make her the ideal CFO for Moody's as we invest in and grow our subscription-based Analytics businesses and continue to expand our ratings business around the world. So it's an exciting time for Moody's. And I look forward to Noémie jumping in beginning April 1. And of course, she's going to be a regular fixture on this call going forward. Before we get into the results, I also want to thank Caroline Sullivan, who is here with me, for her immense contributions and support over the last few months as Moody's Interim CFO. And Caroline will remain as our Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Controller. So with that, moving on to our results. 2023 really was a defining year for us here at Moody's. We delivered 8% revenue growth. We grew adjusted diluted EPS by 16%. And we were an early mover in GenAI adoption and innovation, launching our first-ever GenAI-enabled product in December. And I have to say that the energy and excitement across the organization really was palpable throughout the year as we launched new products, we entered into strategic partnerships with some of the world's leading tech companies and we increased the gap in our Chartis RiskTech100 #1 ranking. And as we grew, we also increased our margin by over 100 basis points for the year, all while investing across the firm in technology, in products and in people. And amidst what was a pretty challenging operating environment for our financial services customers, MA delivered ARR growth of 10% with retention rates in the mid-90s. And looking at the three reporting lines of business in MA, that's Decision Solutions, Data & Information and Research & Insights, they delivered ARR growth of 11%, 10% and 7%, respectively. And as we have upped the pace of product development to meet the strong market demand for tools to better manage risk and to digitize and transform workflows, for 2024, we expect MA revenue to grow to approximately 10% with ARR growth in the low double-digit percent range. MIS, meanwhile, delivered 19% growth in the quarter and 6% for the full year. Corporate Finance, Financial Institutions and Public, Project and Infrastructure Finance, they all achieved double-digit revenue growth compared to 2022 on gradually improving market conditions. And I think I used the phrase fragile when describing the markets back on our third quarter earnings call. And this turned out to be true for the fourth quarter, where despite a very active November, December issuance was more muted than we had expected. And we've seen a very constructive start to the year. And consequently, our revenue expectations for 2024 are in the high single to low double-digit percent range for MIS. And I'll touch on this a bit more on the call as well as I'm sure some asset-specific issuance guidance. So looking out over 2024 and beyond, we're really excited about the great momentum in the business and the tremendous growth potential that we've got in front of us. And to capitalize on these opportunities, we're accelerating and increasing the level of organic investment this year in three critical areas: that's GenAI, new product development and platforming and technology. And this is a deliberate investment program to fully capture the power of AI across our business, to expand the reach and connectedness of MA solutions and accelerate the technology enablement of the ratings agency, all to deliver on our ambitious medium-term targets. Now our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, invest in our business whenever we see great opportunities, and we are, in fact, doing that; and second, return capital to stockholders. And this year, we expect to nearly double the amount of capital we return to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. And that brings me to our EPS guidance. We're anticipating adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.25 to $11 for 2024. This incorporates a little bit wider range at the beginning of the year to capture some of the uncertainty around issuance. And we would expect this to narrow during the course of the year. And of note, as you compare 2024 EPS guidance to 2023, you might remember we had some outsized tax benefits in the first half of last year that resulted in a 2023 effective tax rate of 16.9%. And for 2024, we're expecting the rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. And if you look through the 2023 benefit at the midpoint of our 2024 range, our 2024 adjusted EPS represents 24% growth rate since 2022. And that's in line with the low double-digit percentage growth that we've targeted over the medium term. Now looking at 2023, I want to take a moment to touch on a few data points that highlight what a powerful franchise we have and also put our 2023 accomplishments into some perspective, amidst, as I said, what was a very challenging operating environment for many of our customers last year. And despite relatively modest MIS rated issuance growth of about 5%, we generated approximately $450 million in incremental revenue growth across our entire company. And today, we have a base of recurring revenue of over $4 billion while our more transactional-oriented revenue model across a $74 trillion universe of rated debt gives us upside as debt velocity improves. And together, this underpins our confidence in accelerating our revenue growth to the high single to low double-digit percent range in 2024. And over the years, we have really built a customer base that's almost like no other company with 97% the Fortune 100 and 87% of the Forbes 1000 being a Moody's customer today. And the world's leading companies turn to us. They trust our market-leading solutions. And that gives us a tremendous base to sell into. This shows up in the many external accolades and awards that we've received. We had over 150 last year alone. And I want to give a special shout-out to our MIS team as we were awarded Best Credit Rating Agency for the 12th year in a row by Institutional Investor. That is great stuff. And I think we all understand our market-leading position in ratings. But we've also built a market-leading position with our MA business. And for the second year in a row, we were ranked #1 in the Chartis RiskTech100. And that was supported by category wins in strategy, banking and insurance and a number of solutions categories ranging from climate risk to credit risk to financial crime data and a number more. And understanding the critical importance of attracting and retaining the best talent in this environment, we continue to lean into our culture to make this the kind of place where the brightest minds want to build their careers and help our customers address some of the world's great challenges. So to sustain our growth, you frequently hear about the investments that we make in our solutions to help our customer make better, more informed decisions about risk. And we achieved a number of important milestones in 2023, too many to get into on this call. But I am going to focus on just a few of the highlights. In ratings, we continue to expand the markets we serve through Moody's Local. We also developed dedicated teams in digital finance and private credit so that we're at the forefront of opportunities in the global debt markets. In private credit specifically, we're coordinating across our ratings franchise so that we have the engagement, the methodologies and the analytical and commercial resources to be the agency of choice for players in this market, ranging from BDCs to alternative asset managers, insurance companies and debt funds. To further address the private credit opportunity, we added more than 12,000 unrated entities to our CreditView research service in November. That triples the breadth of our coverage and provides a new runway for growth for our research business. Another growth opportunity in our Research & Insights business that many of you have heard about is our Research Assistant product. That's our first GenAI-enabled product that we launched commercially on December 1. And it's the first of a number of GenAI-enabled tools that we're developing. And we're excited about the initial customer feedback and early traction with this product. And I'm sure we're going to touch on this a bit more in the Q&A. We also continue to enhance and expand our massive company database in important ways to create valuable early warning signals for our customers and address the increasing demand for third-party risk management. And there were really three elements to that in 2023 that I'll call out. First was integrating our predictive analytic tools and credit scores on over 450 million companies into Orbis; the second was expanding our coverage of over 1 million AI-curated and scored new stories a day that are available on companies in Orbis; and third, leveraging our investment in BitSight. Over the course of 2023, we integrated over 6 million cyber scores into Orbis. And that number continues to grow. Across Decision Solutions, we developed new solutions and integrated more data sets to expand the utility of our offerings. And in KYC, our new entity verification tool combines real-time registry content with our Orbis data to help our customers identify risky shell companies and minimize the potential for fraud and sanctions risk. With the launch of our most recent Sanctions360 tool, we're the only one in the market who can look through multiple complex layers of corporate hierarchies and ownership structures to identify potential sanctions breaches. In banking, we integrated climate analytics into a broad range of workflow solutions from loan origination to portfolio management to stress testing. And in insurance, in just a year, we more than doubled the number of customers using our cloud-based Intelligent Risk Platform. That's a versatile cloud-based risk analytics platform that enables customers to analyze hundreds of millions of commercial and residential locations. And it's not just being used by insurers. We're attracting a diverse set of customers who have a tangible and growing need for our more sophisticated climate data and analytics. I have to say, I'm proud to report that at the end of January, we signed one of the world's largest banks as a new customer of our climate and catastrophe modeling solutions to support the in-depth climate analysis for required regulatory disclosures and stress testing. And underpinning all of this is our ongoing foundational investments in the business. And these investments will enhance our ability to integrate our data estate across all of our customer use cases more efficiently and more effectively. So I hope as you get a sense, there are a lot of exciting things that are happening here at Moody's. And as I take a step back to consider the many opportunities for growth ahead, I really am energized by all that's in front of us. And there are three things that we are doing to really drive future growth: that is land new customers, expand customer relationships and then innovate continuously to deliver more value. And I just touched on the breadth and quality of our existing customer relationships. We've got a fantastic customer base, especially in financial services, where we've been developing relationships for literally decades, landing new customers, expanding relationships and innovating with a proven track record of growth. And in recent years, we've been successful in growing these relationships further and diversifying into new areas like KYC and supplier risk management. In fact, our net expansion rate in the financial services sector stands at a healthy 109%. And I think that's a pretty clear indication of our ability to deepen relationships and deliver value. And now leveraging GenAI and our broader content sets and capabilities, expanding and deepening these relationships will continue to be a significant opportunity for us. Now building on these successes, we've got a great opportunity to expand in new customer segments, supporting new use cases. While Financial Institutions account for about 70% of ARR in MA, there's been very good demand coming from newer relationships beyond the financial services segment with 14% new sales compound annual growth rate over the last 2 years in these sectors. And that's the corporate and public sector. And over that period, we've established significant relationships with major companies in the United States and Europe, who are leveraging our expertise for customer and supplier risk assessment. Our ratings business also has some opportunities to serve existing and new customers. I think those as kind of the markets of tomorrow. We've expanded our footprint in domestic and emerging debt markets, where the growth is faster than it is in more developed debt markets. And interesting data point, the Moody's Local initiative in Latin America, which you've heard me talk about, is a great example of doing that, where organic revenue grew 22% in 2023. So these land-and-expand opportunities are supported by major secular trends that are driving demand for our offerings. And I would cite a few of those. We're poised to capitalize on the content unlock opportunity from GenAI enablement and innovation, the widespread digitization and transformation programs across banks and insurers, the growing demand for third-party risk management solutions and the ongoing growth of the private credit sector. And with our wide-ranging capabilities that we've put together to deliver this holistic view of risk, I think we are uniquely well positioned at the intersection of these trends. So I can assure you that we reflected a lot on these opportunities as we entered our annual operating plan cycle this fall. And not dissimilar to past years, we were challenged to prioritize and balance organic investments with operational efficiency and productivity initiatives. On the efficiency side, we expect to generate savings from resource redeployment, alternative staffing models, automation and GenAI enablement and geolocation strategies. And we're prioritizing investment spending on areas that are enabling us to deliver at our current growth rates, including SaaS-based product development, sales deployment, operational resiliency and ratings workflows. And these initiatives are really funded within our -- what we think of as our regular pace of operating margin expansion. But as we exited the initial sprint around GenAI innovation last year, we reflected on the opportunities ahead of us. We considered the deep customer relationships that I've just touched on, our unique data assets that you hear us talk about, the market trends that I just mentioned, together with our growth strategy. And we proactively upped the organic investments that we started in the summer of last year. And we are increasing our budgeted operating expenses for 2024 by an additional $60 million in three primary investment areas. First, and I'm sure this isn't particularly surprising, is GenAI. We're increasing product-related investments across MA that will continue to build on our early-mover momentum from 2023 and investments across the company and initiatives to accelerate employee adoption and improve productivity. On the product side, we have a few really interesting things that are moving ahead fairly quickly. So CreditLens, which is our flagship banking origination solution, will be the next to launch a GenAI-enabled capability to generate a credit memo within seconds, leveraging the digitized information about borrowers and their credit facilities that is stored natively in our software. And we're going to be saving loan officers and credit professionals countless hours compiling information and generating the first draft of the documents that are produced with virtually every commercial loan. We've got our first beta customer already. And we are currently in preview with a number of other customers. I'm also very encouraged by our new GenAI-enabled commercial real estate early warning system that we believe will significantly enhance commercial real estate portfolio monitoring capabilities for both lenders and investors. And I actually just sat through a demo of this in the last week or 2. And the early warning system integrates a wide range of our datasets. It enables the evaluation of news events in real time, running scenarios and calculations that link together market forecasts, listings and property data, tenant data and valuation and credit models. And again, the early feedback has been very positive. And we're already looking to extend these capabilities beyond just commercial real estate. Now from an internal perspective, we've rolled out GitHub Copilot and some other GenAI tools to more than 1,500 engineering professionals across the company. And as a result of our experience last year, we've specifically planned for efficiency gains in our engineering budgets in 2024. We're also rolling out our next generation of AI-enabled tools for our sales teams across the company over the next several months. So that's the first area. The second area is product development. And as part of our land-and-expand strategy in MA, we are building on the success and momentum of our KYC business, which has grown to over $300 million of ARR in just a few years. And I think those of you who've been on this call for a while, you've heard me mention before that our -- that Know Your Customer is probably too limiting of a term for this business as it continues to expand. So this year, we're increasing investments to develop solutions focused on the growing market demand really for solutions to serve their customer and supplier risk needs. And we're especially encouraged by recent wins with a number of large government and Fortune 100 customers. So this year, we're going to make investments in product, technology and data and go-to-market capabilities to be able to scale in these customer segments. The ratings ecosystem also continues to evolve. In early January, we were just provided with the very first -- we just had the very first rating on a tokenized bond fund. And while digitized -- or sorry, digital finance is still nascent, we're going to be ready to help our customers delivering our ratings on the platforms wherever they are going to issue. So that's second. And then third is around technology platforming. So we're building on the platforming work that we highlighted in our Innovation Open House event back in September. And as we explained then, this work is critical to strengthening the interoperability of all of our data estate and improving the synergies across our solutions. By investing in our platforming and engineering capabilities, we're going to accelerate our time to market, enhance the customer experience, better enable cross-sell and upsell and deliver engineering efficiencies. The faster this work gets done, the sooner we will realize the revenue and efficiency benefits, so we have decided to hit the accelerator. The same is true in ratings, where more tech-enabled workflow is really key to the quality, speed, efficiency and compliance. And we've been on a journey to modernize, digitize and automate our systems. We've made some good headway. But there is still more work to be done. Optimizing our data estate and moving more of our workflow into cloud-based applications really has never been more important, given the promise of AI and the digitization of financial markets. So here, too, we decided to accelerate our efforts. And this will be critical in achieving our medium-term margin targets. So now let me turn to our issuance outlook very briefly. We're expecting more constructive market conditions in 2024. And I'm sure, as you have all seen, it was a very busy start to the year, over $150 billion in investment-grade issuance in January alone. Underpinning our MIS revenue growth outlook of high single to low double digits is an increase in MIS rated issuance in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. For corporates, we expect that leveraged finance will grow faster than investment-grade issuance, which should be favorable to revenue mix. And our outlook is built on the macroeconomic assumptions that are detailed on Page 20 of our webcast deck and notably incorporating a soft landing here in the U.S. and rate cuts starting in the second quarter of this year. And I imagine we'll dive deeper into both our issuance and macroeconomic assumptions in the Q&A session. But before moving off of MIS, I do want to highlight that early last year, we committed to reviewing our medium-term guidance for MIS revenue growth once we saw a sustainable improvement in the debt markets. And I'm happy to share that following 6% revenue growth in 2023 and the expectation of at least high single-digit growth in 2024, we have updated our medium-term growth target for MIS, revenue growth target for MIS to be in the mid- to high single-digit percent growth range. Now moving back to our 2024 annual guidance. Moody's revenue is expected to grow in the high single to low double-digit percent range. The Moody's adjusted operating margin is projected to be in the range of 44% to 46%. That's about 100 basis points of margin improvement at the midpoint. And the Moody's revenue and adjusted operating margin guidance ranges incorporate the variability of that MIS transaction-based revenue and then balanced against the subscription base in MA, where nearly 95% of our revenues are recurring. In regards to MA, we're guiding to a tighter range of approximately 10% growth -- revenue growth and low double-digit growth in ARR. Now MA's adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31% this year. That's absorbing the impact of the incremental organic investments that I just talked about. In the medium term, we expect MA's adjusted operating margin to be in the mid-30s percent range. And as I have discussed with a number of you, the path to that target is not exactly linear. For 2024, MIS's adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 55.5% to 57.5%. That is a 200 basis point improvement versus 2023 at the midpoint. And that is solidly on track towards the medium-term target of low 60s percent. Our expenses overall are expected to grow in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. A couple of factors worth noting. First, we closed out our 2022/'23 geolocation restructuring program at the end of 2023. Caroline can talk more about that. Second, we expect depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $450 million in 2024. That's an increase of approximately 20% as compared to 2023. And that growth is largely related to the cumulative effect of our shift towards developing exclusively SaaS-based solutions starting back in 2021 and coupled with the increased capital expenditures associated with the three primary areas of incremental organic investment that I just talked about. And we're expecting free cash flow of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range, I said earlier, of $10.25 to $11, again a 24% increase at the midpoint versus 2022, looking through those tax benefits that I touched on. So I'll wrap up by just saying it was a really great year for us here in 2023. I'm expecting an even more exciting one ahead. I'm energized by our strategy. We've got fantastic engagement across the company. And we believe that now is the time to invest in the opportunity that's in front of us, to fully embrace the power of AI across our business, to accelerate the build-out of our technology platform and to bring together our content to build new solutions with unique value propositions that will accelerate growth. So with that, I welcome Caroline, Steve and Mike to join me for Q&A. And operator, please open the call up to questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.', 'Keen Fai Tong', ""I wanted to ask about your planned incremental strategic investments in GenAI products and platforming. Can you talk a little bit more about the timing of these investments as well as benefits you're expecting and the margin impact for 2024?"", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes, George. I might start by -- maybe I'll just give you a little more insight into kind of what's in those three main components. And then we'll talk about some of the timing and margin impact. As it relates to GenAI, we've got a generative intelligence team. We've stood up an MCO infrastructure. We've got some incremental engineering costs. We've got additional licenses. I mentioned, GitHub Copilot. We will get the benefit of that, but we had costs upfront. And of course, we have incremental cloud costs and token costs relating to large language models. On the product development side, really it's about the build-out of our customer and supplier risk offerings for the corporate and public sector. And that's data, workflow and go-to-market. And then on technology and platforming, as we talk about building out that MA platform, it's things like engineering around single sign-on and entitlement so that, as I said, we can get those benefits faster. Let me turn that over to Caroline and see if you want to just help George around the timing of all of that."", 'Caroline Dolores Sullivan', ""So we anticipate, if you look at both MIS and MA, to deliver -- MIS has delivered an operating margin in 2023 of 54.5%, roughly in line with our target of 55%. And in 2024, we're expecting adjusted operating margin to increase by about 200 basis points. MA's margin is going to remain consistent with what we saw based on 2023. Without that $60 million that we talked about in Rob's comments related to the investments, MA margins would have been on track to increase and expand by 120 basis points."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.', 'Toni Michele Kaplan', ""Rob, I wanted to take a step back for a second and not asking about '24 at all, just in general. Where do you think a normalized level of issuance is? How much upside is there from here to get back to a more normal growth environment and maybe particularly with rates at maybe a higher level than they have been in the last couple of years?"", 'Robert Scott Fauber', 'So maybe a couple of ways to kind of triangulate around this. I think as far back as 2022, as you remember, we had that significant decline in issuance from the pandemic years. On the call, I talked about how total -- when we look at total global issuance, it was modestly below what was a, I\'ll call it, kind of a 10-year average from, at the time it was, I think, 2012 to \'22, excluding the 2 pandemic years. And I think total issuance in 2022 was something like 5% below that average. So it\'s not a big number. And remember, that was in the context of like a 30% decline in issuance that year. But we drilled down, and I think we made the point that corporate issuance was something like 15% below that long-term average, excluding the pandemic. And if you actually drilled even further and got into leveraged finance, it\'s even farther. And as you know, corporate issuance, and in particular leveraged finance issuance, is quite favorable to our revenue mix. So it\'s interesting, Toni. Now as you as you kind of go forward and we look at where 2023 ended relative to that average, it\'s roughly in line. Corporate issuance was closer to in line, I\'d say, modestly below that long term. And with 2024, actually issuance will be slightly above that long-term average. And that holds true for corporate issuance, where obviously we have a little bit stronger growth expectations. So from that aspect, I think you might say, ""Well, we\'re getting back to something that feels more like a normalized level of issuance."" The caveat to that, I guess, this idea of debt velocity. So over that period of time, there\'s been an enormous amount of debt issued, right? So the stock of debt has grown significantly. And when we look at annual issuance as a percent of the total stock outstanding, that\'s what we think of debt velocity, that number still looks a good bit lower than the averages over, call it, the last decade, which would imply that there\'s still room for issuance growth. And the last thing I\'d say is if you look at where structured finance is at the moment, that\'s significantly below kind of that 10-year average for reasons that we may get into later in the call. But hopefully, that gives you some insight.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.', 'Manav Shiv Patnaik', ""Maybe I could just ask about 2024 in terms of the cadence of issuance you've assumed either first half or the back half. And then maybe just some color on how we should think about your non-transaction piece of the MIS business, how that should grow, I guess, this year?"", 'Robert Scott Fauber', 'Manav, I think I might ask Mike to give us some color around how to think about first half, second half. And then I might be able to put kind of a finer point on that.', 'Michael L. West', ""Yes. Thanks, Manav. So first of all, I think we're expecting here issuance in the first half to be stronger than in the second half. And that's a common pattern if you actually look over previous years. Some of that is due to the constructive conditions that we're seeing at the moment with spreads tightening and sentiments improving. And these issuers are trying to lock in the rates that they want before any potential volatility. Some of it is actually seasonality that we see each year, given that we do expect a slowdown in the second half through summer, and sometimes it tails off when we get into December. The other important factor when you think about issuance is that some of those more frequent issuers in investment-grade, in corporate and the banks tend to come earlier in the market to secure their funding and manage their balance sheets. Infrequent issuers, on the other hand, can be opportunistic and will wait for those opportunities and windows that they see fit. Consistent with the comments I've just made is what we've discussed with, with the market. And just picking up on Rob's comment, structured finance actually tends to be more balanced between the first half and the second half. So while we do expect our first half to be busier, we do expect that activity will continue into the second market. So Rob, I don't know if you want to just put a firmer point on that one."", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes. And I know people want to have a good sense for informing their models. So last year, as Mike said, issuance was more front-end loaded. We had a rising rate environment. Something like, I don't know, call it, 56% of 2023 annual issuance was in the first half of the year. And while we do expect a rate decline in the second half of the year, as Mike said, we still think that issuance will be front-end loaded. And our current assumption for issuance is pretty similar to the pattern that we saw in 2023. Now then we got to translate it to MIS revenue. And the impact there is a little bit less pronounced in terms of first half, second half. And I would say that we're expecting just a little over half, maybe low 50s percent of MIS revenue in the first half. And that's a little lower than the issuance mix. Why? Because banks are the ones that tend to issue and do more front-end loading of their issuance. And there are different economics for infrequent bank issuers. So hopefully, that gives you a sense. One of the things, Manav, I might say just specifically for the first quarter, I'd say we expect probably close to 30% of annual issuance and probably closer to somewhere between 25% to 30% of MIS annual revenue."", 'Operator', 'Your next question will come from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.', 'Faiza Alwy', ""So I wanted to ask about MIS margins. I think, Rob, you alluded to some investments. But maybe put a finer point around that. Because I would have thought you would have better sort of margin flow-through, given the revenues that you're expecting. So is it all investments? Is there some mix? And just give us a bit more color around those investments."", 'Caroline Dolores Sullivan', ""I can take that question. So just to follow on to what Mike and Rob just said about the phasing of our revenues, because of that, we are forecasting higher margins in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. So that's what we will see for MIS. But overall, we're expecting adjusted operating margins to increase by 200 basis points."", 'Operator', 'Your next question will come from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Ashish Sabadra', ""I just wanted to better understand how we should think about the ROI for the strategic investments. Obviously, the investments that you made in the prior year has accelerated the MA revenue growth. I was wondering, how should we think about the growth accretion from these investments? And maybe just a follow-up on that one is how should we think about the GenAI monetization in '24 but also midterm?"", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes. Maybe I'll start with that and then hand it to Steve. I'd say just in general, as you think about the return on these investments, I would say that we're investing in the highest growth parts of our business. So GenAI products, that's going to augment growth across our SaaS and hosted solutions. And Steve will touch on that in just a second. We're investing, as I talked about, in enhanced solutions for corporates and the public sector around customer and supplier risk. And I had that data point that we've had 14% CAGR in terms of sales growth over the last 2 years from those sectors. And we think we can even enhance that growth at scale as we invest in products specifically for those customer segments. And then lastly, platforming, we expect revenue growth from our SaaS and hosted solutions to grow something like low-teens this year. That's in line with our medium-term targets. And the growth has been even higher in Decision Solutions. It's been more like high-teens from SaaS and hosted solutions we're looking for this year. So I think there's a pretty strong case for investment in these high-growth parts of our business. But Steve?"", 'Stephen T. Tulenko', ""Yes, just a couple other comments. We're doing what we do well: developing good, solid product development pipelines; creating new product life cycles to generate revenue growth and support customer value propositions; continuing to invest in the sales force. And then what we've said today is making even more an incremental investment in GenAI, and especially in areas where we think we can land new blue-chip customers maybe outside of financial services. We have such a tremendous franchise with the financial services sector, we see great opportunities and have demonstrated great growth trends with some new customers in corporations that may be are nonfinancial in their orientation or public sector entities. I think you'll see lots of new products coming online this year in the GenAI space in particular. Rob mentioned a couple that are coming down the pike in the next quarter or so, maybe quarter -- second or third quarter. We are actively engaged throughout the product development and engineering teams to build more value propositions and leverage GenAI to support our customers and help them not just do their business faster and save some money but be more effective and be more productive when they're doing it, actually make better decisions, develop better analyses. And the Research Assistant, which we've launched already, I would expect you'd start to see some contributions in the Research & Insights line toward the end of this year. Because as the sales start to ramp up, ARR growth numbers will start to move as well. So seeing -- we expect to see actual contributions in the numbers before we turn the page on 2024."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.', 'Alexander Kramm', 'This is actually a direct follow-up to the prior question. Because Rob, I think a couple of quarters ago, I asked you about this GenAI being potentially part of your guidance already for this year in terms of revenue contribution. So it would be helpful to give a little bit more specificity in terms of both revenue and ARR. What are you actually budgeting in terms of contributions here for the year since you obviously raised some pretty high expectations? And maybe just related to that, I mean, you mentioned some early feedback. So just obviously very interested in your ability -- or signs of your ability to actually upsell people and people not just coming back to you and saying like, ""Look, you\'re asking for more money all the time. Of course, you should enhance all products, but we\'re not going to be willing to pay up as much as you think you can."" So a little fleshing out there would be helpful.', 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Alex, thanks for the question. So I think we've learned a good bit over the last few months as we've been engaging with customers, as we've been signing customers, as we've been building the pipeline. And all of that is informing how we're thinking about our guidance. I think, Steve, why don't I hand it to you just to give some insight into what we've learned and how we're -- how we think about that then following through the MA business?"", 'Stephen T. Tulenko', 'Yes. So just a quick short answer to your question, Alex, is the Research & Insights line is where you\'ll see the biggest contribution coming from GenAI-related products because that\'s where we\'ve got a product in-market already. Sales cycles take some time to develop. We are seeing some pretty interesting patterns, to Rob\'s point. It\'s interesting, the -- maybe investment managers and hedge funds that are smaller teams, a little bit more agile and able to make a decision right now are the ones that are buying this product literally right away. So our first sales that are coming in are coming in from these players where the boss is sitting at the table with the people who are the users, the boss, maybe a user. And they\'re saying, ""Wow, this is really going to make a difference. Let\'s just do it right now."" Some are locking into multiyear agreements, by the way. So they\'re believers in this as a productivity enhancer for them. On the other side of the spectrum, where we have big customer relationships with large banks, we\'re engaging very differently. The character of the conversation is a lot more like what we\'ve seen over the years in the software and workflow sales dynamics. So we\'re engaging very senior levels. They\'re talking about leveraging what we\'re doing as a transformational tool to change the way they do business. They see the opportunity to cut cost, maybe lower their cost of goods sold, maybe lower their -- increase productivity through platforming and using our capability as an element in their platforming efforts, like what we\'re doing in terms of leveraging GenAI throughout the organization. And we\'re seeing project -- transformation projects, where people are looking forward to working with us, evaluating us very, very intentionally. And we\'re engaging with scores of users, for example, to get a reading on can they really make a difference leveraging this tool or can we make a difference leveraging us in their organization? And we\'re seeing some really interesting conversations, often at the C-level. So this isn\'t your run-of-the-mill add-on to the research service, which we\'ve been doing for decades. This is a, ""Gosh, this might really change the way I do investment research. This might really change the way I think about doing credit research at scale."" And that\'s one of the reasons we\'re very excited about that dynamic. So the first couple of months have been interesting. Smaller, faster decisions are happening. And people are buying the product at a rate that\'s above our normal rate of sales patterns. The patterns are faster than normal. And at the top end, we\'re seeing really good engagement in a way that I say -- I think is going to be quite profound for us.', 'Operator', 'Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Jeffrey Marc Silber', ""I think earlier in the call, you gave a little color on cadence for first half versus half versus second half in terms of revenues and margins for MIS. And I'm wondering if you could do the same thing for the MA division."", 'Robert Scott Fauber', 'Caroline, do you want to take that?', 'Caroline Dolores Sullivan', ""Sure. So for MA, we see a slightly different picture to MIS with regards to both revenue and with regards to expenses. So for -- if we start at the fourth quarter for MA, we recorded just under $800 million of MA revenue. And we're expecting just above $800 million in Q1 and then steadily ramping up by $20 million to $25 million through quarter 4. The MA margin will kind of follow a similar path. However, Q1 will be influenced just by some seasonality to our expenses associated with our annual compensation programs with our employees. So we'll see higher payroll taxes associated with the vesting of employee stock grants and bonus payments. But then the margin is expected to follow a similar pattern to revenue, steadily ramping from a couple of percentage points below our full year guide of 30% to 31% in the first quarter to a couple of points above it by the time we get to Q4."", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""And while we're on the topic of -- now that we've covered MIS and MA calendarization, maybe let me just add a little bit in terms of thinking about then, kind of pulling this together and thinking about what it might mean for adjusted diluted EPS. So we've got a little bit front-end loaded issuance pattern that we talked about, the cadence that Caroline just touched on.From an adjusted diluted EPS standpoint, we think that the first quarter will be our strongest quarter in terms of absolute adjusted diluted EPS, followed by the second quarter. And maybe the easiest way to think about it is this. If you take the average quarterly EPS at the midpoint of our full year guide, and I think that's somewhere between $2.60 and $2.70, then given the stronger front half issuance that we've talked about, we'd expect first quarter EPS to be something like $0.15 to $0.20 higher than that average for the first quarter."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.', 'Craig Anthony Huber', ""Mike or Rob, I'm curious, with the ongoing massive problems out there in the commercial real estate market out there, I'm curious what your thought is on the potential impact for CMBS issuance for this year, ratings there, and also more importantly, on your banking client, potential impact this year for the commercial real estate market out there. What are you sort of expecting for issuance there as well? And just my quick housekeeping question, what was the incentive comp in the fourth quarter, please, and also for the full year last year?"", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""All right. We'll get Caroline teed up on that incentive comp question. I think, Craig, commercial real estate, actually if you think about it, kind of threads through a bunch of parts of our business in terms of impact to the ratings business. And it's not just the CRE sector but the banking sector and then the tools needed by folks in the market and sales cycle. So let me start with Mike."", 'Michael L. West', ""Thanks, Craig. So on the structured finance, just to try and put that into context, I mean, we are anticipating overall that structured finance will grow mid-single digit. And when you look into that, there's different types of assets. And when we think about CMBS, let me just pick on CMBS first for your question, we believe that will still be muted, given what's going on in the CRE market, particularly in office. It is a viable funding alternative to bank finance, particularly as borrowers face restrictive lending standards.But I do want to emphasize that when we look at our structured finance business, that we are expecting still a active market in ABS and CLOs. I'm very happy at some point on the call to talk a little bit more about CLOs. RMBS, on the other hand, again muted because of the asset formation, which we expect to improve as the year goes on. But with that, I might just pass to Steve and talk about the MA side of CRE."", 'Stephen T. Tulenko', ""Yes. So I mean, I think we've been talking a lot in the firm and with our customers about the impact of, I'll call it, stress in the CRE sector, particularly the office sector. And we all know many of the causes there. We've had really good interest from our banking customers especially. We launched -- you may remember at the Innovation Day back in September, we highlighted the CreditLens CRE module, which was really a credit decisioning tool, software application that combines all of our data and analytics capabilities in the commercial real estate space to help lenders do their jobs more effectively. And we've seen really good growth there in the banking segment. That was one of the big drivers of growth for us. So I would say that's exactly what you would expect. As people start to be more aware of risk, they start to call us a little bit more. And this is one of those dynamics in MA, where risk goes up, people call us more often. Risk goes down, they start to think about taking more chances, so maybe looking for more alpha perhaps. So we get calls there, too. So the CRE segment and the CRE, I'll call it, stress is something that we find an attractive dynamic for the business overall."", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes. There's almost like a tipping point, where when there's too much stress in the banking system, it can ultimately become a headwind for us. As Steve said, when there's the need for real insight and better understanding around credit, that's a positive. And I think what we saw in March of last year was just about going over that tipping point. Caroline, do you want to answer the second part of Craig's question?"", 'Caroline Dolores Sullivan', 'Sure. Craig, with regards to incentive comp, for the fourth quarter, we recorded about $100 million. So that got us to about $400 million for all of fiscal 2023. And just with regards to 2024, we expect incentive comp to be between about $400 million to $420 million, so think about $100 million to $105 million per quarter.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.', 'Owen Lau', 'So going back to your MIS revenue guidance, you guided to high single-digit to low double-digit percentage, which is higher than your peers at mid- to high single digits. And I know you have limited information about your peers. But could you please try and talk about some of the potential drivers for the difference?', 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes, I think, Mike, why don't I hand that to you?"", 'Michael L. West', ""Yes. So Owen, thank you for your question. I'll start at the macro level, and as Rob mentioned, overall constructive outlook for 2024. And underpinning this is that, first of all, market uncertainty that we've experienced over the last couple of years starts to subside. And if you think that transmission is to a lower execution risk in the primary markets and also improved secondary trading, that leaves more opportunity for issuance. And that's what we're seeing at the moment. We have an assumption around a rate decrease in the second quarter. And that's unchanged despite some of the CPI print today. We've already seen that spreads have come in meaningfully, both in investment grade and sub-investment grade, which leaves the market open for the rating scale from investment grade down to the lower-rated credits. And that's important as one of our expectations here is that leveraged finance improves and recovers during the year from historical lows over the last couple of years. In here is also the 10% increase in the refinancing walls, we talked about that on the last call, and a modest recovery in M&A. That's still uncertain, but there's certainly sizable dry powder and cash on the corporate balance sheet. There's also a backdrop here. Even though we've got moderating economic growth, we are assuming an avoidance of a deep recession and, therefore, economic resiliency and looking towards that growth in 2025 as people think about deploying long-term capital. At the same time, as spread comes in, that is also a key assumption in our default study. And as we get over that peak default period during the year, as spreads come in, that is a more favorable environment for the lower end of spec grade. So that's underpinning a lot of our macro picture. But Rob, do you want to add anything?"", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes. And we can -- if people want to get into the asset-level guidance, we're happy to do that in another question. I also -- I think it was Manav that asked a question about recurring revenue in MIS. And maybe let me just come back to that. That continues to be -- our view on that is it continues to be in that kind of low to mid-single-digit range for revenue. This ties in part to first-time mandates. Obviously, first-time mandates are what build the stock of rated issuers that we surveil, so just a little insight there.We saw a pretty significant slowdown in first-time mandates since, I'd say, third quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter, first-time mandates were about in line with the fourth quarter of 2022. We are expecting that to start to pick back up. And that's not surprising, given what you see as our expectations for high yield and leveraged loans. And so that will support a slight uptick, I think, in recurring revenue growth for MIS."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.', 'Scott Darren Wurtzel', ""Just wanted to go back to the Research Assistant, understand it's only been a couple of months since you launched the product, but wondering if you could maybe share some feedback since the launch and anything you've learned about the product in the last couple of months."", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes. Thanks, Scott. I would say we are happy about a couple of things. One, the product development process, the work we did in engineering and product development to get this thing out happened more quickly than maybe some of our previous product launches. So we're really excited about some of the changes we've made and we were able to get to market faster. That's partially because of the fact that we're leveraging GenAI tools and partially because we have some platform engineering elements that make us able to move a little bit more quickly. So that's one good note.In terms of take-up among customers, it's early days. Oftentimes, these -- the initial stage of the sales cycles, I would measure in months. But we have more units in the first 6 weeks than we've seen among virtually any other product we've launched in the past. So the people are making buying decisions quickly. Remember, we started with a December 1 commercial launch. So they're making decisions within 6 weeks. Oftentimes, you would look at a sales cycle being measured in months. So that's a really good sign.And again, I mentioned earlier that we're really encouraged by the engagement at the senior levels. CEOs, I literally know one of the largest banks in the United States, we were the topic of conversation at the CEO's table within the last few weeks, where they literally were thinking and talking about this as one of the elements in their transformation program, COOs, senior levels of investment managers at banks and insurance companies, where I'm talking to people and our sales reps are talking to people at a different level than we've seen in the past. So I would say we're very encouraged by that.Those sales cycles, I think, will go faster than maybe they might have in previous product launches. But you still need to engage with people and their technology groups, their cyber groups, their compliance groups to make sure when you're making this big of a decision that's this transformational that you've got all your bases covered. So we're pretty encouraged by that. Hopefully, that's a good sense for color on the demand environment."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.', 'Shlomo H. Rosenbaum', ""I just -- I wanted to ask a little bit, we talked a lot about GenAI. But I wanted to ask about general sales cycles. Like what are you seeing? Are things -- cycles getting shorter, staying the same, getting any longer? What do you see more on a sequential basis? And then I just want to touch back on the last question about incentive compensation and ask if there's any change in the mix of the incentive compensation between the two units, just getting back to kind of the margin expansion in MIS."", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""So on the sales cycle -- thanks, Shlomo. In the spring last year, we got a lot of questions around, are you seeing elongated sales cycles? And I think we gave a pretty good sense for what we were seeing. Sales cycles were lengthening maybe just a little bit, nothing material, measuring in a matter -- in a number of days perhaps. But we were also seeing higher price points in the proposal and richer value propositions composed in that proposal. So it was consistent with what we would expect.I'd say that trend has actually extended through 2023. So we're running right around the same numbers we were in the spring. I looked at this closely the other day. So sales cycles are maybe slightly longer than they were maybe a few years ago, but only because we're seeing bigger price points and richer value propositions, so pretty happy about that. Let's see here, anything else on sales cycles? Yes, that's probably a good way to finish that one, yes."", 'Caroline Dolores Sullivan', ""And then on the question on incentive comp, we're not seeing anything materially different between the segments compared to '24 versus '23."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo.', 'Seth Robert Weber', ""I guess, I just wanted to follow up on the MIS margin question again. I'm trying to just balance some of the investments that you're making versus some of the investment spend that you're doing versus longer-term technology benefits, cost saves there. Can you just remind us or update us on how we should be thinking about incremental margins for the MIS business going forward, if there's been any change to just the incremental margin framework for that business?"", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes. And maybe I'll also go back a little bit to fourth quarter MIS because I think we've been getting some questions about that. And what -- I think fourth quarter to me really illustrated the tremendous operating leverage that's in the business. And if you look at -- to give you a sense of what we were seeing in the fourth quarter for MIS and then I'll take it forward into 2024 and beyond, revenues came in lighter than we had expected. Expenses came in almost exactly online in terms of what we had budgeted. I think it was something like 1.5% expense growth over the prior year quarter. So essentially, the entire revenue miss dropped right down to adjusted operating income. And again, that's what we love about this business. And think about what was going on, this was in the last few weeks of the year. There's virtually nothing we can do in regards to the expense base at that point. The majority of our expense base in MIS is people. Also, we have obviously a constructive view on 2024 issuance. And you've heard us talk about in the past that we try to think about, are things cyclical or structural, and we saw that as a brief air pocket in issuance. And so that then did -- again, that dropped right to adjusted operating income. It was not an expense issue. And then you see 200 basis points of margin expansion from that jumping-off point at the end of the year. And I would say this and, Mike, feel free to add, so we've got our low 60s percent margin target. We still feel very comfortable about that. We believe that this 200 basis points is solidly on track for that. But we are investing back in that business. I talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks. In particular, we've been investing in resources in some of these areas like domestic debt markets, like digital finance and private credit, make sure we've got the resources. And then we've also been investing in the technology. It's so important for us to get the technology enablement of the analytical teams for a variety of reasons that I touched on the call. Mike, anything to add to that?"", 'Michael L. West', ""Not really, but just on the technology element, it's about driving efficiencies in the future by investing today and having a very well-controlled business. So that's the only point to add."", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes. The bottom line is, as we get more technology enablement and we have surges in issuance, we'll be better able to handle that without having to add people."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.', 'Steven Pawlak', ""It's Steven Pawlak on for Jeff. I guess, going off that last point, you talked about the GenAI tools that you're deploying internally. Can you describe some of the ones that have gone live? What efficiencies are being harnessed? Where do you think you can get the most benefit towards the medium-term targets from those GenAI tools? And then is there like an enterprise-wide committee handling decisions to build or deploy? Or are some of these things being handled within individual departments?"", 'Robert Scott Fauber', 'Yes. Steve, do you want to start?', 'Stephen T. Tulenko', ""Yes, yes, sure. So we're doing a lot of the innovation work and trying to accelerate the innovation work through a central team, a team that is really a pretty agile team. Sometimes it's bigger, it gets bigger and smaller, depending on which project we're working on. That team is in MA, where we're doing a lot of the experimentation and then getting -- developing value propositions that we can use externally and internally. I'll just give you a simple example.Summarizing a PDF, which is something that you would expect you could do with GenAI tools, you might be able to do that with some tools that are offered through external folks, not just through Moody's. But leveraging that so you can use it in an industrial-strength way, make it a part of your compliance apparatus, make it a part of the way in which you build products, the way in which you do your job every day requires some engineering work as well. So we're summarizing maybe a 300-page document. We're developing summaries across multiple documents at once. We're incorporating a document that you're reading today into our other GenAI tools in order to generate inference across not just what you might get from the OpenAI models we're working with Microsoft on but also through the content that you're introducing to your analysis right now and right here. So an experiment that could see being very helpful for the folks in MIS might be I am doing work on this particular industry. There's three or four documents I might be interested in reviewing. And maybe I can incorporate them into understanding -- reading them more quickly, taking in, gathering data from that much more quickly. So the central team is there to create critical mass in terms of engineering and then roll out tools in a compliant way in a way that's been tested from an industrial-strength perspective and is consistent with all of the normal processes that we would want to adopt as a rating agency, where it's appropriate."", 'Michael L. West', ""Yes. Just maybe a couple of points for MIS. I mean, we're pretty excited about the potential of GenAI in the ratings business and internally with obviously leveraging the Moody's Copilot. But we also do envisage that using GenAI across the workflow and doing that to actually enhance our compliance as well as improving the overall efficiency in the business and seeing that GenAI that Steve just referenced as an enabler to human judgment in the ratings process. So again, exciting opportunities for MIS to navigate with this technology."", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes. And the only thing I would add, and I've said this when this comes up, is that we're going to be deliberate and transparent in the rating agency in terms of how we leverage generative AI. We're in dialogue with our regulators to make sure that they understand how we're going to do that."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America.', 'Heather Nicole Balsky', ""Just with regards to your midterm margins, you talked earlier about that you didn't -- that the path wasn't necessarily going to be linear to get there. But can you help us bridge kind of as we think out over the next couple of years how it could look, especially given some of these areas that you're investing in? And how comfortable are you kind of, if the opportunity presents itself, would you spend more now for top line growth or, I guess, just the commitment to those margins, given what you're seeing in the environment?"", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Heather, thanks for the question. So I think that's what you're seeing us do, right? And we've got to make -- the investment has got to come before the sales. And ultimately, the revenue growth comes. And I feel like we have some ambitious medium-term targets that mean that we're going to continue to accelerate revenue growth in the MA business. And so we're making the investments that we talked about today to be able to support GenAI, product development and platforming, which we think are going to support that acceleration for the reasons we talked about. We continue to feel comfortable with those medium-term targets, particularly the -- I mean, you mentioned the margin. It's just that in this case, the investment is coming before the ARR growth."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.', 'Andrew Charles Steinerman', 'This next is for Caroline. Could you just talk more about the 20% increase in D&A? Is there any change of accounting assumptions or methods? And will D&A kind of stay in this general vicinity as a percentage of revenues?', 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes, let me just -- I'll start with that and then I'll turn it over to Caroline. I think, in general, what you're seeing with D&A represents the -- we've been talking about the investments that we've been making in our SaaS products. You've seen some increased capital expenditures over the last few years. That's now starting to come through in the form of capitalized software. And I also talked about the higher growth rates that we are seeing with those SaaS products. And I think that's -- you want to be able to look at those two things together. Across all of MA, we're expecting our hosted and SaaS solutions to be growing in kind of the, call it, low double digits to parts of the MA portfolio, like Decision Solutions, we expect to be growing more like high-teens. And that's where that investment in software development is going. Caroline, do you want to talk a little bit about it from an accounting perspective?"", 'Caroline Dolores Sullivan', ""Yes. So certain development costs linked to the SaaS-based solutions are capitalized and then they're depreciated over the useful life of those underlying assets. And that's usually around 4 to 5 years. And that's all in accordance with U.S. GAAP."", 'Andrew Charles Steinerman', 'Okay. And should it stay in this vicinity, D&A as a percentage of revenues, going forward?', 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Yes. I think if you look at it as a percent of revenues, I mean, obviously, we're bumping up the CapEx here a little bit. But I think as we get to the increase in revenue growth, then corresponding increase in capitalization should stay relatively in line from a percent -- I think a percent of revenue basis."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And your next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.', 'Craig Anthony Huber', ""My follow-up here, for 2024, can you just talk a little bit further about your outlook specifically for investment grade, high yield, maybe bank loans and financial institutions in terms of a debt issuance outlook for this year that's embedded in your overall company outlook? And then also, can you maybe just throw in there, what is your cost ramp assumption over each of the 4 quarters for the rest of the year?"", 'Michael L. West', ""Craig, I'll take the first part of your question before handing off. If I go by segment, the investment-grade issuance growing at 5%, that comes off a 20% growth last year. Underpinning this, steady uptick with regard to upcoming maturities. M&A is supporting in certain key sectors, but I would see that as a variable to the upside. As I mentioned earlier, the spreads at the moment are creating favorable conditions at the higher end of the rating scale and down into the Baa. So that's really on investment grade.For corporates, high yield, again back to this market uncertainty that's subsiding, spreads have come in materially over the last 12 months. There's been some delayed refinancing that's now coming due. And these tend to be higher-quality, spec-grade issuers that will get that opportunity to come into the market, should those spreads remain favorable and again, still coming off a low base, as Rob highlighted earlier.Leveraged loan, driven primarily by refinancing, including the amend and extends. There is also a refinancing in the public market of certain deals that got done in the private market, which is nice to see. And again, these tend to be more sensitive at the lower end. So as spreads again come in at lower end, market access to those around the single Bs is there. So again, 20% for the leveraged loan.FIG, on the other hand, as we mentioned, a heavy proportion of FIG is frequent issuers. We've kept that relatively flat. There are some different variables there. There's some different central bank support facilities that will start to shrink in '24, therefore, leading banks to come to the capital markets. And that will also be a focus on their buffers and broader capital needs but stable year-over-year.PPIF, mid-single digit, largely made up of infrastructure financing and access by some of the larger U.S. PFG issuers. When we think about the transition of monetary policy and the tightening that has occurred, that we will probably see an increase in infrastructure projects that are really long-dated as they want to lock into some lower rates going forward. I touched on structured finance earlier at that mid-single-digit percentage. And you've got to look inside structured finance to look at the different asset classes but really ABS leading in that particular area. So hopefully, that helps."", 'Operator', ""I'll now turn the call back to Rob for any closing remarks."", 'Robert Scott Fauber', ""Okay. One public service announcement for those of you in Europe. We're looking forward to seeing you at our London event in our offices on February 29. I know that Steve and Shivani and some of our other senior leaders from Moody's Analytics will be there to provide a spotlight on our MA business like we did in New York in September of last year. So with that, I'm going to bring the call to a close. Thanks, everybody, for joining, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Bye."", 'Operator', ""This concludes Moody's Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call.

The company also licenses foodservice products, such as ground coffee and ready-to-drink beverages, as part of its Channel Development segment that are sold through other channels outside its coffee shops.', ""When Starbucks reported its fiscal first-quarter 2024 results at the end of January, there were several issues weighing on it. Chief among them was China, where same-store sales came in below expectations. The company reported that same-store sales in the country rose 10%, but that was well below analysts' expectations of a 16% increase. Transactions jumped 21%, but its average ticket fell 9% as the company became more promotional to help drive traffic."", 'In the U.S., meanwhile, the company faced backlash from more occasional customers over tweets made by its workers union over the Israel-Hamas war. Starbucks tried to distance itself from comments as they were not its own, but the company said it saw traffic start to decline after the controversy.

It is also trying add more food options to foster daypart expansion and is looking to expand delivery. It is also working on driving down newbuild investment costs.', 'However, the Chinese economy has been slow to recover coming out of pandemic lockdowns. There has been more tension in recent years between the U.S. and China, which could be impacting the perception of some Chinese consumers to U.S.-based companies.', 'In addition, Starbucks has been facing increased competition in the country, especially from Luckin Coffee (LKNCY) following its near collapse after its earlier accounting scandal. The Chinese company has wooed local customers with its inexpensive offerings, often under $2 per cup compared to over $4 for Starbucks, and technology-driven experience with its self-operated stores.', 'For its part, Starbucks said it is not looking to get into a price war with its rival, instead looking to offer a premium experience.', 'On its earnings call, the co-CEO of Starbucks China, Ching Wong, said:', ""The coffee market is evolving, and going through a transition. It's still early days, and it has not yet fully tiered, right? You see an influx of mass market competitors focus[ed] on fast store expansion and low-price tactics to drive trial. This will shake out over time. And yes, we are operating under an increased promotional environment. We're not interested in entering the price war. We're focusing on capturing high-quality but profitable, sustainable growth, okay? And it is our aim to be the best and lead in the premium market, which Starbucks has pioneered in China 25 years ago. And we will continue to focus on premium experience that is high-quality coffee and human connection. And we have clear strategies to fuel our comp and total growth. We're going to dial up our beverage and food innovation with robust marketing activations on social media and in-store. We're going to accelerate our digitalization efforts to drive innovations, sales and productivity.

Notably, growth was often above 10% during this period, but not always, falling to 5% in 2017.', 'Placing a similar pre-pandemic multiple range on the stock would value it between $102 and $143 based on the 2025 Ebitda consensus. Given where growth is projected, I would probably look toward the middle of the range as a potential target price.', ""Starbucks valuation is not that demanding as it has often traded in a range of 15 to 20 times Ebitda over the past several years. Meanwhile, it has some nice growth potential with new store openings and a rebound from some recent headwinds. I expect the U.S. to get back on track and the union's comments to be quickly forgotten."", 'That said, I view China as more of a wild card. Chinese consumers are struggling coming out of the pandemic lockdowns, and the company is seeing a lot of competition from rivals offering cheaper options. Starbucks is used to winning in whatever markets it enters, but despite being in the Chinese market for about 25 years, it is seeing pressure from local upstarts. For example, Cotti Coffee has rapidly expanded in China and ended 2023 with over 6,000 locationsafter launching in only October 2022. That rate of expansion would be unheard of in the U.S., but shows the level of competition the company is dealing with.', 'Luckin, meanwhile, has started outselling Starbucks in China. This has largely been based on lower prices and more locations, but it has also led with innovation, including with a Moutai-infused alcoholic latte that has been a big hit.', 'Given these dynamics, I want to watch how Starbucks is performing in China for a few more quarters before jumping in, as it is one of its biggest growth engines with new store openings.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

This group of Big Tech elite companies have been trouncing the broader market over the past year with their strong returns.', 'But there are still great opportunities to find stocks that can outperform these heavyweights. Don’t get me wrong – the Magnificent Seven should form the core of most growth stock portfolios. However, by digging deeper, smaller yet rapidly-growing companies in high-potential sectors could supercharge your investment returns.', 'My aim isn’t to uncover “the next Amazon” or predict which small caps will reach trillion-dollar valuations. Instead, I look for quality businesses with vast addressable markets, durable competitive advantages, and the ability to compound earnings substantially over long periods. The seven stocks revealed here check all those boxes.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: solarseven / Shutterstock', 'FTAI Aviation’s (NASDAQ:FTAI) performance has been nothing short of remarkable lately.

However, one glance at FTAI Aviation’s financial statements shows this is no house of cards.', 'FTAI owns and manages commercial aircraft engines, focusing on the widely-used CFM56 models. The company also invests in other aviation assets and aerospace products, churning out strong cash flows with room for earnings growth. Revenue in Q3 2023 hit $291.1 million, a 26.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, net income landed at $41.3 million, representing fat profit margins of 14.2%. To put it bluntly, this is a much more profitable enterprise than 85% of its business services peers.', 'Even better, the good times look set to continue. Consensus estimates call for 50% annual earnings per share growth over the next two years, with the stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times 2024 estimates.

There’s no denying Super Micro has made all the right moves to capitalize on this mega trend.

SMCI stock currently changes hands at roughly 30-times forward earnings and 2.2-times expected FY2024 sales. That’s pretty rich for a company projected to grow revenue at a 20% annual clip moving forward. Still, profits should expand even faster, given what was reported in Super Micro’s blowout Q4 report. The company trounced earnings per share estimates by 8.3% and beat the revenue consensus by 12.5%. Indeed, those are strong results by any measure. Plus, it should be noted that semiconductor companies trade at much steeper premiums. This valuation isn’t out of the ordinary in its industry.', 'If AI hype continues gaining momentum, SMCI stock has ample room to grow into its lofty valuation.

The company’s core product is a fintech platform empowering retail clerks to handle transactions like prepaid wireless plans, gift cards, and debit services at the point of sale. It’s a win-win arrangement – partner stores profit on each transaction while providing valuable services to customers. SurgePays also utilizes federal subsidies to supply tablet devices and cellular broadband to income-eligible households.', 'Right now, SurgePays sports a market cap equal to annual revenue. Shares trade at just 4.7-times forward earnings, despite just $5.5 million of debt against $12.7 million of cash in the coffers. This year, SurgePays acquired ClearLine Mobile in a $15 million deal funded by a recent equity offering.

Meanwhile, its net margins approached 22%, powering 83% profit growth over the same period last year. This level of expansion is tremendously impressive. Due to this tremendous performance, SNPS shares have tacked on 55% over the past 52 weeks.', 'As a long-term partner enabling Nvidia’s innovations, Synopsys has also benefited handsomely from the GPU giant’s success. The bottom line is that Synopsys is significantly more profitable than 95% of industry peers. At 42-times forward earnings, the valuation gives me minimal pause, considering the quality of this business. So long as AI and next-gen chips drive multi-year growth runways, I expect SNPS stock to continue compounding at an enviable clip.', 'Source: m.photo / Shutterstock.com', 'TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG) is a leading designer and producer of highly-engineered aircraft components and systems.

Zooming out further, the company’s three-year annualized earnings per share growth rate comes in at nearly 40% (excluding non-recurring items). And if we just look at the past year, earnings per share growth excluding these items came in hot at a blistering 63.5%.', 'Revenue rose 21% in 2023, supported by 27% growth in the high-margin aftermarket commercial segment. TransDigm continues to benefit from the ongoing recovery in global air travel. Shares trade at 35-times forward earnings, which I’m perfectly comfortable paying for durable earnings growth in the high single-digits. Additionally, the company’s 4Q report was superb, with TransDigm beating estimates across the board on revenue, EBITDA, and EPS. Plus, management announced a special $2 billion dividend on top of upbeat 2024 guidance. Sign me up!', 'Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com', 'Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) is undoubtedly pricy by traditional valuation standards.

But I believe the TASER maker’s entrenched position supplying non-lethal weapons to global law enforcement agencies warrants a premium.', 'Expected to deliver 30%+ revenue growth this year alongside 76% bottom line expansion, Axon is firing on all cylinders. The company continues rolling out innovative technologies like body cameras, records management software, drone solutions, and training to become the premier public safety tech provider.', 'With elections nearing, we could see rising tensions on the streets. Axon would likely benefit from a tough-on-crime stance from future administrations. The recent Fusus acquisition and new body camera line for commercial markets should also boost the company’s total addressable market (TAM) by more than $20 billion. So, while this stock’s sticker price gives me a moment’s pause, I remain firmly bullish on Axon’s long-term outlook.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'When I look at e-commerce and fintech growth exposure overseas, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) remains high on my buy list. Dubbed the “Amazon of Latin America,” MercadoLibre operates online marketplaces spanning 18 countries and serving more than 148 million users.', 'Despite torrid growth, MercadoLibre’s balance sheet has surprisingly little debt with a 0.6-times net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. This financial strength provides ample dry powder for continued growth. Consensus estimates call for 35% annualized earnings per share growth over the next decade, which would result in a profitability boost of 13x from 2023 to 2032.', 'So, while shares trade at a meaty 77-times forward earnings today, I believe that the multiple on MELI stock could actually prove conservative given MercadoLibre’s vast runway.

85,69374fe0-bd8d-36ec-ba91-5816215ffd32,PM,2024-02-14,Philip Morris Stock (NYSE:PM) Under $90 Calls Dividend Seekers,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-stock-nyse-pm-064749327.html,1707893269,STORY,['PM'],"['Philip Morris stock (NYSE:PM) has been traditionally held by dividend investors who seek a reliable and steady quarterly income. Displaying a noteworthy pattern in its trading history, the stock consistently finds robust support around the $90 mark. Investors have historically seized the opportunity to capitalize on the stock’s above-average yield at these levels. With shares now trading below this key point after its Q4 results, I believe Philip Morris now presents a compelling entry point. Thus, I am bullish on the stock.', 'I usually don’t pay attention to a stock’s trading patterns, as I generally find little merit in technical analysis and arbitrary lines when assessing an investment opportunity. Nevertheless, I must admit that Philip Morris stock, in particular, features a very distinct trading pattern. Looking at the stock’s trading chart, you will quickly realize that the stock tends to see strong support below $90 and encounter strong resistance above $100.', 'I believe two forces are at play behind this consistent trading pattern. On the support front, there appears to be a magnetic attraction for investors when the stock dips below $90, driven by the allure of a hefty dividend yield (usually 5.8%+) at these levels. The robust dividend prospects of Philip Morris and notable yield form an enticing risk/reward proposition here.', 'Conversely, resistance kicks in around the $100 mark, where investors perceive heightened risk, leading to a less attractive risk/reward ratio. Philip Morris’ investment landscape comes with notable risks, including regulatory uncertainties surrounding consumer health concerns, a declining population of smokers, and intense competition in the heated tobacco and oral nicotine markets.', 'In the present market scenario, it seems increasingly likely that the first force will come into play sooner rather than later, urging investors back into an accumulation phase below the $90 mark. The company’s Q4 results appeared to fall short of estimates at first glance, thus justifying the slight post-earnings sell-off. That said, I believe the numbers were rather strong, while management’s promising outlook for 2024 should instill confidence in investors, further supporting the stock price at its current levels.', 'Philip Morris concluded Fiscal 2023 on a robust note, propelling the company into a promising trajectory for Fiscal 2024. Despite encountering the customary challenges associated with diminishing demand for combustibles, the company’s Heated Tobacco and Oral portfolios showcased remarkable growth, marking Fiscal 2023 as a record-breaking year for revenues and adjusted earnings.', 'Specifically, while Cigarette shipment volumes witnessed a marginal decline of 1.4% throughout the year, Heated Tobacco shipment volumes rose by 14.7%. Moreover, oral nicotine product shipment volumes saw an extraordinary uptick, skyrocketing by 606% compared to the previous year. This increase reflects Philip Morris’ acquisition of Swedish Match in late 2022, which enriched its Oral category product portfolio.', 'The result of notable shipment volume increases and strong pricing power led to net revenues for the year growing by 7.8% in constant currency to a new all-time high of $35.2 billion.', 'Philip Morris also posted robust profitability, a crucial aspect for a company primarily catering to income-oriented investors seeking increasing dividends. The company reported adjusted EPS of $6.01, marking a year-over-year increase of 11%. Furthermore, management anticipates the continued strength in the adoption of heated tobacco and oral nicotine products throughout 2024.', 'Projections indicate a 14% to 16% rise in Heated Tobacco shipment volumes, with an estimated shipment of approximately 520 million cans of nicotine pouches in the U.S. This represents a substantial year-over-year increase of 23%, considering the company shipped 421.1 million pouches the previous year. Based on these factors, the company expects net revenue growth of 6.5% to 8% on an organic basis, coupled with adjusted EPS ranging between $6.43 and $6.55, suggesting continued bottom-line growth.', 'It appears that the Philip Morris dividend case is shining again, driven by the stock trading below $90 and the anticipation of Fiscal 2024 marking a year of record adjusted EPS. The former factor translates to an above-average yield for investors, which currently hovers at 5.8%, while the latter factor suggests increased dividend coverage, thus improving dividend growth prospects.', 'It’s worth noting that Philip Morris has a remarkable history of consistently increasing its dividend, dating back to its time as part of Altria (NYSE:MO), proudly boasting an unofficial (due to being spun-off) streak of 54 consecutive years of annual dividend increases.', 'Regarding Wall Street’s view on the stock, Philip Morris carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on seven Buys and three Hold recommendations assigned in the past three months. At $103.80, the average\xa0Philip Morris stock price target suggests\xa016.4% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell PM stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Gaurav Jain of Barclays (NYSE:BCS), with an average return of 11.01% per rating and a 63% success rate.', 'Overall, I believe Philip Morris presents a compelling opportunity for investors, particularly income-oriented ones. The stock’s distinct trading pattern, with robust support below $90 and resistance around $100, suggests it might be prime time to be bullish.', 'In the meantime, Philip Morris posted strong results in Fiscal 2023, while management suggests that the company is positioned for sustained momentum in 2024. With an anticipated rise in heated tobacco and oral nicotine products set to keep driving earnings growth and, thus, dividend growth, Philip Morris appears to be an attractive income pick, in my view.', 'Disclosure']"

Over to you, Jacek.', 'Jacek Olczak: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. PMI delivered another strong operating performance in 2023. We achieved our third consecutive year of positive volumes and high single-digit organic top line growth, driven by smoke-free products. Smoke-free products delivered accelerated accretion to profitability in the fourth quarter, as our IQOS business delivered meaningful 2023 operating leverage, mitigating a significant drag from combustibles. I am also very pleased to report the continued outstanding growth of ZYN, which was not included in organic metrics until mid-November. Importantly, smoke-free products reached nearly 40% of total PMI net revenues in the fourth quarter and over 40% of gross profit. For the year, smoke-free gross profit increased by 19% organically and we expect smoke-free organic growth to accelerate for both net revenues and gross profit in 2024.', 'ZYN delivered exceptional growth in its first year within PMI with U.S. pro forma volumes up by over 60% for the year and over 75% in the quarter four. Oral smoke-free is accretive to both our smoke-free business and the overall group, with Swedish Match contributing 50 basis points organic uplift to Q4 OI margins from only 50 days of the period. Our IQOS business continues to deliver excellent results with 15% adjusted in-market sales growth for heated tobacco units reflecting broad-based momentum in Europe, Japan, and emerging markets. The rollout of IQOS ILUMA is substantially complete, now present in 51 markets representing over 95% of IQOS geographies by volume excluding Russia and Ukraine. The superior experience and design of ILUMA combined with the strong premium brand equity of IQOS and our unrivalled commercial infrastructure enabled IQOS to outgrow the heat-not-burn category, despite holding a category share of over 75%.', 'Importantly, as we have seen in Japan, the launch of ILUMA is a multiyear growth driver consistent with past IQOS innovations. Our 2023 combustible performance was margin dilutive despite strong commercial results, with very good pricing and higher category share. This reflects the significant cost pressures in the category, geographic mix from volume growth in lower margin markets without smoke-free products, and the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This was also compounded by the technical impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine. While cost and currency headwinds impacted our earnings in 2023, the strengthening growth and margin profile of smoke-free products set us up well to deliver sustainable growth and returns including currency in 2024 and beyond.', 'We reached a number of key transformation milestones in Q4. First, IQOS net revenues surpassed Marlboro to become the number one international nicotine brand on this measure. This demonstrates the power of innovative smoke-free alternatives to switch adult smokers away from cigarettes, and to address the societal issue of combustible tobacco. It is also testament to our organization’s ability to build strong and sustainable brand equity. This also applies to ZYN, the fastest growing U.S. smoke-free brand with another outstanding performance in Q4, marked by an increase in category volume share, retail value share, and overall volumes. We are also proud to have reached 25 markets where smoke-free products exceed 50% of our top line for both Q4 and the full year.', 'We aim to reach 60 markets by 2030, driving our ambition to exceed two-thirds of group net revenues. Last, as I already mentioned, over 40% of our total gross profit was generated by smoke-free products with the adjusted gross margin rate on smoke-free surpassing combustibles for both the quarter and year. We are encouraged by the increasing number of governments adopting tobacco harm reduction policies to encourage reduced risk nicotine consumption instead of smoking, which is ultimately more sustainable for society. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of work remains. Sustainable growth requires a sustainable business, and we continue to garner increasing recognition for our sustainability performance across the key product and operational topics for our company.', 'PMI was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time, and for the fourth year in a row DJSI North America. In addition, PMI was awarded carbon disposal projects Triple A rating for the fourth consecutive year. I will now hand it over to Emmanuel to discuss our results and outlook in more detail.', 'Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. Let’s start with the headline numbers. We finished the year strongly with Q4 organic net revenue growth of 8.3%. This includes 14% growth from smoke-free products despite slower HTU shipment growth due to comparison effects, and also 5% growth from combustibles. Pricing was a strong driver for both categories, with smoke-free pricing including the impact of retail price increases on HTUs. While Swedish Match was only included in organic metrics as of November 12, it contributed 0.8 percentage points to Q4 organic top line growth and grew by an excellent 26% on a pro forma basis. Operating income grew organically by a very good 8%, including a Swedish Match contribution of 2.2 points. As expected, Q4 margins were broadly stable organically, and grew excluding the technical effects mentioned by Jacek.', 'This enabled our business to deliver another quarter of double-digit currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth at 12.2%. This exceeded our prior expectations with ZYN’s remarkable growth a notable contributor. Despite this strong currency-neutral result, Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.36 was adversely affected by a greater than expected currency impact of $0.20. This includes a $0.09 balance sheet related impact under hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina, following the devaluation of the peso in mid-December. As with the previously mentioned impact in Q3, this reflects the depreciation of monetary net assets denominated in pesos, which are subject to capital controls. By its nature, this does not carry forward to future periods. Turning to the full year.', 'Net revenues grew by plus 7.8% organically, representing the third straight year of high single-digit growth. Similar to Q4, this reflects continued excellent IQOS momentum and strong combustible pricing. In 2023, Swedish Match, led by ZYN, grew pro forma ex-currency net revenues by 20%. Operating income grew by plus 3.7% organically, reflecting a challenging first half followed by strong growth in H2. We delivered expansion in both adjusted gross margins and operating income margins in H2, driven by the strong progress of smoke-free products. With the impact of accelerated device sales from the ILUMA rollout in the base and a return to sea freight to Japan, the effects of growing HTU volumes and ongoing cost optimization are clearly visible.', 'As expected, OI margins organically contracted 150 basis points for the full year, primarily due to acute cost and supply chain headwinds in H1. As flagged in prior quarters, full year margins include a 40 basis point headwind from the accounting treatment of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine, primarily reflecting the Indonesia excise tax gross up of around $250 million growth in both net revenues and cost of sales. While headwinds in combustibles have not fully abated, our smoke-free business is delivering excellent profit growth, and our organic results will include the strong contributions from Swedish Match going forward. We successfully mitigated inflationary pressures and supported investments with efficiencies. Across our total operating cost base, we delivered an incremental $100 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q4, and $2.2 billion for 2021/2023 overall, surpassing our $2 billion target.', 'We target an additional $2 billion over the next three years. These positive factors allowed us to deliver very strong currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11%, ahead of our prior expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.01 includes unfavorable currency of $0.63, primarily reflecting the Japanese yen, Russian ruble, and specific Argentine peso dynamics I just explained. We include a slide in the appendix to this presentation with more detail. Focusing now on volumes. We comfortably achieved a third consecutive year of shipment growth driven by a 15% increase for IQOS HTUs, in addition to a resilient combustible performance. Our smoke-free volumes made up over 20% of total PMI in Q4, and with continued mid-teens or better growth expected here, we are very well-positioned to continue growing volumes over the mid and long-term.', '2023 HTU shipment volumes of 125.3 billion units were at the lower end of our targeted range due to delayed launches in Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, combined with lower-than-expected underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine. For IQOS HTUs, we believe the best indicator of underlying growth is adjusted IMS, as the closest metric to consumer offtake. For the full year, adjusted in-market volumes and shipment growth were in line at plus 15%. In the fourth quarter, HTU shipment growth of 6% reflects trade inventory build-up in the prior year quarter and the plus 14% adjusted IMS growth is therefore a more reliable measure of continued strong growth momentum. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, adjusted in-market sales grew by more than plus 17% for the year.', 'For context, across the two years before the war began in 2022 these markets made up 23% of HTU shipment volumes and exceeded the company’s growth rate by a notable margin. These smoke-free volume growth rates exclude the excellent development of our oral nicotine portfolio driven by ZYN, with shipment volumes up by plus 23% in Q4 and plus 17% in 2023 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 1.4% in 2023, outperforming the international category decline of 2.4%. Turning to profits. Organic operating income growth stepped up in H2 to plus 10% following the exceptional headwinds of H1. We believe this is more representative of the underlying momentum of our business, and in line with our 2024/2026 CAGR target range of plus 8% to 10%.', 'Focusing now on some key drivers of our full year operating income, smoke-free gross profit grew organically by an excellent plus 19%, expanding gross margins by 340 basis points. This reflects part of the operating leverage of IQOS I already mentioned, with a notable contribution from Swedish Match oral nicotine in the last 50 days of Q4 with organic operating profit growth of over 50%. With smoke-free commercial costs also increasing by less than net revenues, this clearly bodes well for 2024 as we continue to benefit from scale effects and manufacturing optimization. Despite very strong pricing there was only marginal organic growth in combustible gross profits. This partly reflects the negative geographic mix I already mentioned, with greater volume declines in higher margin markets like Japan as adult smokers switch to smoke-free products, and better volume trends in lower margin geographies where smoke-free products are small or not available such as Turkey.', 'There were also significant inflationary pressures on leaf, direct materials and other manufacturing costs. Cost increases on leaf, where inventories cover multiple crop years, and wages are likely to carry over into 2024, and should ease thereafter. Moving now to Swedish Match, which delivered outstanding performance in its first full year as part of PMI, with adjusted pro forma currency neutral top line growth of 26% in Q4 and 20% in 2023. When we announced our offer for Swedish Match in 2022, we targeted a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital within five years. With the growth of ZYN surpassing our expectations, we now expect to achieve this well ahead of time. ZYN delivered another remarkable U.S. performance with plus 78% volume growth in Q4 and 62% in 2023.', 'Internationally, we have launched or relaunched ZYN in 10 markets as planned, as we continue to focus on building a truly global brand. U.S. cigars posted robust 2023 results, growing net revenues and profits. This was driven by strong pricing following an increase in April, partially offset by volume declines which reflect lagged competitor pricing and comparison effects. ZYN’s excellent U.S progress continued in Q4 with 15% sequential growth in 12-month rolling shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the third consecutive quarter to 72.8%, an increase of plus 5.4 points year-on-year and plus 2 points sequentially. Retail value share also grew during the quarter to 77.4%, highlighting ZYN’s premium positioning and superior brand equity.', 'This accelerated growth again reflects a broad step-up in nationwide store velocities and gradual distribution expansion as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. Now focusing on IQOS, starting with user growth. We estimate there were 28.6 million IQOS users as of December 31st, representing growth of 1.2 million users in the quarter and 3.7 million for the full year, a nice acceleration compared to 2022. This includes notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. ILUMA is now available in essentially all major markets outside Russia and Ukraine, with over 17 million estimated adult users as of December 31, 2023. This reflects the switching of existing IQOS users and the acquisition of adult smokers.', 'We expect ILUMA to drive continued strong IQOS user growth in 2024 and beyond. Considering the seasonal fluctuations and volatility in quarterly user estimation, we plan to report this metric on a semi-annual basis going forward. With the addition of ZYN to our portfolio, and a smaller, but growing VEEV e-vapor business, we also intend to provide a more holistic view of our total smoke-free user base to investors. Moving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where smoke-free products made up more than 45% of Q4 net revenues. Our Q4 adjusted HTU share increased by plus 1.2 points to 9.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. A key driver is the growing uptake of ILUMA, which is available to around 90% of IQOS users in the region after eight further launches during the quarter.', 'In the EU, 11 markets making up nearly 30% of regional IQOS volumes adopted the delegated directive to implement a characterizing flavor ban on heated tobacco products and implemented clean-shelf policies in October. While still early days, we estimate only a small impact on offtake as consumers adjust, as well as on trade inventory levels. Indeed, adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit very good sequential growth and reached a record high 12.4 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects double-digit year-on-year progression of plus 13% in Q4, despite the lack of growth in Ukraine. We expect the remaining EU markets to adopt the characterizing flavor ban in 2024 and estimate a full year consumer adjustment impact of around 2 billion units on both shipment and IMS, representing less than 5% of regional volumes and less than 2% of total PMI.', 'This is consistent with other past flavor restrictions, such as the EU ban applied to combustibles in 2020. Based on the initial data from markets that have enacted the ban, our fundamental view remains the same. We do not expect a meaningful change in the structural trajectory of the category, and indeed expect Europe adjusted IMS progression to be broadly in line with the group growth rate in 2024. Europe is also an important geography for innovation. LEVIA zero-tobacco HTUs were launched in the Czech Republic in mid-October through limited channels with an encouraging initial response. We plan a broader Czech rollout later this month and further market launches this year. In Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 40% of the total industry, with IQOS driving its growth and reaching over 8.5 million adult users.', 'In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.1 points to 27.6% with off-take share surpassing 34% in Tokyo. Adjusted IMS volumes increased by 14.5% year-over-year for 2023 and 13.4% in Q4 alone, reaching a record high of almost 10 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Such impressive growth in a market with already high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable potential of IQOS around the world. HTU shipment volumes returned to a more normalized state in the fourth quarter as compared to a tough prior year inventory comparison, following the substantial completion of the transition back to sea freight in Q3. In addition to strong IQOS share gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle income markets.', 'This slide highlights a selection of Q4 key city off-take shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Egypt continues to impress with Cairo off-take share up plus 3 points to 9.4%, also noting encouraging results elsewhere in the region such as Morocco and Lebanon. Indonesia also saw notable progress in its capital city, especially given limited commercialization. We continue to see dynamic off-take volume growth across these important future markets, with the city shares towards the right of this chart an indication of the exciting potential. While we have already covered the margin dynamics on combustibles, our 2023 commercial performance was very robust with organic top line growth of plus 5.5%. This reflects both strong pricing, with notable contributions from Germany and Indonesia, and positive share performance within a resilient international category.', 'Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.1 points in Q4 and plus 0.2 points in 2023 with notable contributions from Egypt, Poland, and Turkey. Although flattered by competitor supply constraints in Egypt, which may normalize in 2024, we again achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share excluding this effect, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This remains key as our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products. This combustible share performance combined with the structural growth of IQOS led to an increase of plus 0.6 points of international cigarette and HTU share for the full year. As mentioned previously, our superior share of smoke-free products gives us a formidable platform for sustainable share gains, with superior unit economics.', 'Before we turn to the 2024 outlook, let me briefly reflect on our strong delivery over the past three years, in spite of a number of substantial headwinds. The performance was clearly positive compared to our currency neutral 2021/2023 targets of more than 5% organic top line and more than 9% bottom line growth, supported by overall growing volumes. For the next three years we target a similar strong volume delivery, a plus 6% to 8% organic net revenue CAGR, and a step-up in organic operating income growth to plus 8% to 10%. We target an adjusted EPS CAGR of plus 9% to 11% ex-currency growth at constant 2023 corporate tax rates, including an increase in net financing costs which skews towards the first year of the period in 2024. Okay. This brings me to the outlook for 2024, where we expect a strong acceleration in smoke-free performance across IQOS volumes, smoke-free net revenues and gross profit.', 'We forecast the highest ever absolute increase in HTU adjusted IMS volumes to deliver plus 14% to plus 16% growth in percentage terms, despite the inclusion of an estimated impact of around 2 billion units from consumer adjustment to the EU characterizing flavor ban I mentioned earlier, and essentially no off-take growth in Russia. For shipment volumes, we target more than 140 billion units, subject to the usual inherent volatility of shipment timing, new market launches and potential supply chain disruptions, such as the ongoing situation in the Red Sea. While shipment growth rates naturally follow adjusted IMS over time, there is a possibility of some lower inventory levels compared to 2023 given the substantial completion of ILUMA launches and opportunities for working capital optimization.', 'We expect continued excellent U.S. ZYN volume growth to around 520 million cans. We have also accelerated our capacity expansion plans to support this further significant step-up in volumes and to manage inventory levels, which are naturally affected by the recent level of growth. Such a strong outlook for IQOS and ZYN means we expect to deliver an acceleration in organic smoke-free top line growth compared to 2023, reaching close to $15 billion in net revenues at prevailing exchange rates. This supports a total PMI forecast of plus 6.5% to plus 8% organic net revenue progression, including a fourth consecutive year of total volume growth and mid-single digit combustible pricing. We also forecast an acceleration in smoke-free gross profit growth from the organic plus 19% delivered in 2023 as IQOS profitability expands and ZYN’s excellent economics continue.', 'We expect smoke-free to again drive the lion’s share of our forecast organic OI growth of plus 8% to plus 9.5%, notably given the enduring cost pressures and negative geographic mix in combustibles I just mentioned. This naturally implies organic margin expansion, even factoring in the ongoing technical dilution impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia. We expect a meaningful organic improvement in overall gross margins excluding technical impacts, and a very limited currency impact on adjusted OI margins. This forecast includes notable capability investments in the U.S., but as mentioned at Investor Day we still expect to deliver strong double-digit operating income growth in this market. As flagged at last year’s Investor Day, we anticipate an increased net financing expense this year as debt is renewed at higher rates.', 'We forecast a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, as compared to $1.1 billion in 2023. We also assume a higher effective corporate tax rate due to Russia’s suspension of certain double tax treaties and earnings mix. These tax and interest factors combined impact our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth projection by around 2 percentage points. Accordingly, we forecast currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 9%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.32 to $6.44, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.11 at prevailing rates. This notably includes a net favorable impact of $0.13 related to the revaluation of monetary balances in hyperinflationary economies in 2023, skewed to the second half comparison.', 'Moving to the shape of expected 2024 performance on a quarterly basis, we anticipate good double-digit growth in adjusted IMS HTU growth every quarter supporting the full year forecast of plus 14% to plus 16%. We forecast a strong Q1 overall with HTU shipment volumes of 31 billion to 32 billion and continued strong volume growth from ZYN. We expect organic top line and operating income growth to be broadly consistent with the full year outlook, which implies organic margin expansion as with the full year. We project strong Q1 currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 10%. This translates to a range of $1.37 to $1.42, including a negative currency variance of $0.10 at prevailing rates, with currency comparisons improving in the second half as we lap the Argentina impacts of 2023.', 'Our business remains highly cash generative. However, the $9.2 billion in 2023 operating cash flow was lower than expected. This was due to currency effects on net earnings including the Argentine peso devaluation, other year-end currency impacts and higher-than-expected working capital needs. In 2024, we target between $10 billion and $11 billion in operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rates and subject to working capital requirements. We continue to prioritize investing in innovation and the growth of our smoke-free portfolio. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures of around $1.2 billion including the ZYN capacity expansion I just mentioned. Deleveraging remains a key priority for us, and as expected our 2023 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was around three times given the 2023 purchase of the remaining Swedish Match minorities and the final U.S. IQOS payment to Altria.', ""We target much better progress of 0.3 to 0.5 times deleverage in 2024, driven by continued EBITDA growth and strong cash flow generation. We continue to target a ratio of around two times by the end of 2026, with buybacks to be considered once confirmed we are on track. Finally, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. I'll now turn it back to Jacek for concluding remarks."", 'Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Emmanuel. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for 2024. First is supporting the sustained growth momentum of IQOS through continuous innovation. This includes leveraging the rollout of ILUMA to maximize user growth, while innovating further on both devices and consumables. Second is to continue the strong U.S. growth of ZYN, supported by targeted commercial investment, long-term capacity expansion and organizational infrastructure, which will also support IQOS. Outside the U.S., we intend to continue developing our integrated multi-category offering to adult nicotine users with further launches of ZYN and, where relevant, our VEEV e-vapor portfolio. Of course, 2024 will be a landmark year for IQOS in the U.S. While the ultimate launch of IQOS ILUMA is the main priority, we continue to prepare for the first city tests of the IQOS 3 blade product starting in Q2 this year.', 'These small-scale pilot launches will allow us to experiment with different aspects of commercialization and support our drive for at-scale commercial success once ILUMA is authorized. While we have no update on the expected PMTA timeline, the patent settlement agreement announced last week allows for commercialization of both blade and induction products while mitigating risks of patent-related disruption and enables us to leverage the scale, optimized cost and flexibility of our global supply chain. In combustibles, we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, while taking judicious pricing actions to drive a positive profit contribution. Our capital allocation priorities are crystal clear.', 'We will continue to invest in the growth of smoke-free products, and our commitment to the dividend remains steadfast. Following the acquisition of Swedish Match, deleveraging remains our key balance sheet objective. We aim to continue our excellent progress on sustainability initiatives, including those related to product impact such as youth access prevention and post-consumer waste. Finally, and importantly, we remain committed to transforming the tobacco harm reduction landscape by providing superior alternatives to adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking and advocating for science-based regulations. We will be expanding further on many of these topics at the CAGNY conference in two weeks’ time. Let me now conclude today’s presentation.', 'Overall, our business delivered a strong 2023 performance in the face of notable cost headwinds, driven by structural smoke-free momentum. The continued excellent performance of IQOS and remarkable growth of ZYN strengthened their positions as leading brands with excellent equity. Combined with our unrivalled commercial and innovative capabilities, we have a powerful platform to expedite our smoke-free future as we broaden our portfolio and reach to adult smokers. We expect 2024 to be a year of accelerated growth for smoke-free products and remain confident in our 2024-2026 growth targets. We have exciting opportunities in the U.S. and internationally, which we are fully dedicated to capture as we progress towards our ambition of being sustainably smoke-free by 2030.', 'Finally and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash-generative business underpins our ability to deleverage while returning cash to shareholders. Thank you. And Emmanuel and I are now happy to answer your questions.', 'See also 15 Highest Quality Fish Oil Supplements for 2024 and 17 Fastest Growing Cities in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

If you want to skip our overview of autonomous driving and how it's one of the most important sectors today especially when we consider the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy Now. "", ""The biggest trend in the stock market these days is artificial intelligence. While data science has been an industry for years, artificial intelligence has come to the public's attention only because of OpenAI's massive success with ChatGPT. Before ChatGPT became available for public use, data science was primarily used in industrial cases such as supply chain management, drug and vaccine development, fraud detection, and others."", ""Another application that relies heavily on data science is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving is the technology that relies on a computer to aid a driver while they're on the road, and the industry has been able to progress quite a bit over the past couple of years. In fact, the same drivers of the A.I. wave, i.e. semiconductors designed and sold by firms such as NVIDIA Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), are also behind the rapid progress of autonomous driving systems."", 'These systems are made by public and private companies, and the former are traded on the stock markets as autonomous driving stocks. Autonomous driving stocks are those companies whose hardware or software is present in autonomous driving systems, or whose business operations are indispensable to the functioning of the autonomous driving industry. The potential of car makers to continuously gather data from every vehicle as it is being driven and then use this data to train algorithms that are capable of making driving decisions on their own has proven to be quite beneficial to autonomous driving stocks.', ""In fact, the world's most valuable car maker in terms of market capitalization, the Austin, Texas based electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) owes, some, if not most, of its market value to the simple fact that the firm's first principles driven approach led by its chief Elon Musk has enabled it to also operate as a technology company. This has made Tesla the world's most valuable autonomous driving stock, and the firm's massive market capitalization of $588 billion is based on its production systems and the massive amounts of data it has at its disposal to train its autonomous driving product, the Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) platform."", ""However, while Tesla's FSD continues to remain functional and operational despite the daily dose of controversy surrounding it, 2024 has also seen some other autonomous driving stocks struggle. One such autonomous driving stock is General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), whose Cruise autonomous driving system underwent a tragic accident in October last year that led California to pull its permits. Since then, a crucial GM update provided in January 2024 has created uncertainty about Cruise's future, and some quarters worry whether it will be able to regain compliance by the end of this year, especially after having laid off 25% of its workforce."", ""Since Tesla's FSD is in a world of its own, its rivals such as GM compete with each other. Another mega cap stock that is also an autonomous driving stock is none other than the consumer technology behemoth Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Now structured as a holding company that makes money from or funds the losses of a variety of lucrative business, one such Alphabet division is Waymo. When it comes to California, Waymoe and Cruise account for 99% of the test driving miles in 2023. And now, as Cruise's future becomes uncertain, Waymo has the 'road clear' when it comes to develop autonomous driving technologies."", ""As for Cruise, here is what General Motors had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:"", 'Our plan 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadence go-to-market strategy and we are developing new financial targets and a new roadmap. Spending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware, and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable, profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise EVs to the road soon. To summarize, we learned a lot in 2023, and those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholding value.', 'You’ll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV, and software plans, while meeting our financial targets. So our goals are truly aligned with yours. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches, and we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all four pillars of our strategy, ICE, EV, AV, and software. When we do get together, we will show you what we’ve done, not just tell you what we’re going to do.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.

These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. Excluded items include the following:', 'changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;', 'net change in market risk benefits (MRBs);', 'changes in benefit reserves related to net realized gains and losses;', 'changes in the fair value of equity securities;', 'net investment income on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;', 'following deconsolidation of Fortitude Re, net realized gains and losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;', 'loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;', 'all net realized gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized gains and losses to specific APTI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances);', 'income or loss from discontinued operations;', 'net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);', 'pension expense related to lump sum payments to former employees;', 'net gain or loss on divestitures and other;', 'non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;', 'restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization;', 'the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain;', 'integration and transaction costs associated with acquiring or divesting businesses;', 'losses from the impairment of goodwill;', 'non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles; and', 'income from elimination of the international reporting lag.', 'Adjusted After-tax Income attributable to AIG common shareholders (AATI) is derived by excluding the tax effected APTI adjustments described above, dividends on preferred stock, noncontrolling interest on net realized gains (losses), other non-operating expenses and the following tax items from net income attributable to AIG:', 'deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;', 'changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and', 'net tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.', 'See page 15 for the reconciliation of Net income attributable to AIG to Adjusted After-tax Income Attributable to AIG.', 'Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance... companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.', 'Accident year loss and Accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (Accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT and Accident year combined ratio, ex-CAT): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses (CATs) and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events, in each case, having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.', 'Underwriting ratios are computed as follows:', 'Loss ratio = Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred ÷ Net premiums earned (NPE)', 'Acquisition ratio = Total acquisition expenses ÷ NPE', 'General operating expense ratio = General operating expenses ÷ NPE', 'Expense ratio = Acquisition ratio + General operating expense ratio', 'Combined ratio = Loss ratio + Expense ratio', 'CATs and reinstatement premiums ratio = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – (CATs)] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes] – Loss ratio', 'Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted (AYLR ex-CAT) = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – CATs – PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes +/(-) Prior year premiums + Adjustment for ceded premium under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years]', 'Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted (AYCR ex-CAT) = AYLR ex-CAT + Expense ratio', 'Prior year development net of reinsurance and prior year premiums ratio = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – CATs – PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes +/(-) Prior year premiums] – Loss ratio – CATs and reinstatement premiums ratio.', 'Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts, Federal Home Loan Bank funding agreements and mutual funds. We believe the measure of premiums and deposits is useful in understanding customer demand for our products, evolving product trends and our sales performance period over period.', 'Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.', 'American International Group, Inc.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$6.21b', 'US$7.98b', 'US$9.62b', 'US$11.1b', 'US$12.7b', 'US$13.9b', 'US$14.9b', 'US$15.8b', 'US$16.6b', 'US$17.2b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x23', 'Analyst x22', 'Analyst x12', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x4', 'Est @ 9.53%', 'Est @ 7.36%', 'Est @ 5.84%', 'Est @ 4.77%', 'Est @ 4.03%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% ', 'US$5.8k', 'US$6.9k', 'US$7.8k', 'US$8.4k', 'US$8.9k', 'US$9.1k', 'US$9.1k', 'US$9.0k', 'US$8.8k', 'US$8.5k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$82b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth.

Do keep this in mind.', ""The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Netflix as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.085. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.', 'Netflix recently bet $5 billion on the idea that pro wrestling is due for a renaissance.', 'It’s not hard to see why. Wrestling has all the drama of reality TV, but on steroids. It’s oozing with Millennial nostalgia. And it’s the kind of entertainment in which the central conceit, known as “kayfabe,” has never been more relevant.', 'Put simply: The wrestling you associate with names like Hulk Hogan is scripted. But the people in it are committed to playing it out as real life, inside the ring and out. That’s kayfabe, and it’s a lens we can apply to a distressingly vast array of experiences in our extremely online lives, when the line between spectacle and substance is increasingly porous. (See also: most social media, AI deepfakes, national politics generally.)', 'The potential liability for Netflix, though, lies with World Wrestling Entertainment’s longtime puppet master and promoter, Vince McMahon.', 'McMahon, who is 78, resigned last month as executive chairman of TKO, pro wrestling’s parent company, after being sued by a former employee who says she was sexually abused and trafficked by McMahon to other men at WWE, McMahon’s family-run empire, where he was the longtime chairman and chief executive. Beyond that lawsuit, according to the Wall Street Journal, McMahon is also under federal investigation for alleged sexual assault and sex trafficking.', 'McMahon has denied the allegations.', 'A Netflix spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment.', 'While McMahon has officially stepped out of the ring, his name won’t be easily excised from the world of wrestling he built over four decades, according to Abraham Josephine Riesman, author of the 2023 unauthorized biography of McMahon.', 'In her 2023 book, “Ringmaster: Vince McMahon and the Unmaking of America,” Riesman pulls back the curtain on the world of pro wrestling that launched the careers of such figures as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, “Stone Cold” Steve Austin and, to an extent, former President Donald Trump.', 'I talked to Riesman late last month, as news of McMahon’s resignation was breaking, about McMahon’s rise and fall, the evolution of kayfabe and what a post-McMahon future looks like for the wrestling world.', 'The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.', 'CNN: Vince McMahon has been a powerful force in American culture over the last 40 years, but I think that’s hard to convey to non-wrestling fans. How would you sum up McMahon’s legacy?', 'Riesman: For about 40 years, Vince McMahon was the central actor and gravitational point for the American and Canadian professional wrestling industry. Now, professional wrestling seems like a sideshow to the American story, or at least, slightly ridiculous, and therefore not worthy of serious consideration.', 'But pro wrestling is beloved by the populace. And Vince McMahon managed to build a bridge between professional wrestling and the corporate and political worlds of America — that was the big innovation that he brings to the story of wrestling.', 'Vince managed to have it both ways — at once being incredibly successful and respected while also making a product that was regarded as so silly that nobody really took much of an interest in the abuses that it was meting out on the people within it.', '(Note: McMahon has faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct over the years. He remains under federal investigation, and he has not commented publicly on millions of dollars in hush-money payments he reportedly made to several women at WWE. In 2022, McMahon said that he promised to cooperate with the investigation.)', 'CNN: Your book makes the case that the wrestling world built by McMahon kind of planted the seeds for Donald Trump’s political rise. Can you explain a bit how those two are connected?', 'Riesman: Donald Trump has been watching McMahon family wrestling since he was a child in the 1950s. Vince’s father and grandfather produced the wrestling that little Donny Trump grew up in Queens adoring, it was his favorite thing.', 'Trump has done a lot of shows with Vince, and he learned a great deal from that. If you go watch his early pro wrestling appearances, he takes to it like a natural. Trump really absorbed not only the delivery, but a lot of the reality-bending as well.', 'And Vince, since the mid 1980s, has been an active player, and eventually an enormously significant player, in Republican politics in the United States. He and his wife, Linda, pursued deregulation in wrestling, and that pursuit put them in contact with politicians in a big way.', 'Eventually, in the new millennium, once they really have some money after taking the company public, Vince and Linda become major political donors.', 'By the time the 2010s rolled around, and then the Trump campaign rolls around, you had this candidate who gets a lot of money from [WWE] fans. By then, Vince and Linda were already very close with Trump.', 'CNN: I’m hardly the first person to make this connection, but would you consider Trump’s style a kind of political kayfabe?', 'Riesman: It’s not just political kayfabe. There’s kayfabe, and then there’s what Vince really pioneered, which is neokayfabe, a term I made up.', 'After Vince made it a part of public record that wrestling was fake, that led to sort of the end of the illusion that wrestling was a legitimate, unplanned competition in the sporting realm.', 'Neokayfabe is when you operate not on the assumption of telling the audience, “Hey, everything you’re about to see is real.” You start by giving them the assumption, “Hey, everything you’re about to see is fake — except the parts that you think are real.”', 'It’s Trumpism. You’re left to kind of choose your own reality. So whether you are just taking it in and not trying to sort out what’s real, or whether you’re obsessively trying to sort it into true and false, you’re paying attention, and that’s all that matters.', 'CNN: I confess that I was never much of a wrestling fan, partly because the overt performance of masculinity didn’t really appeal to me. With the allegations against McMahon, it feels like we’re seeing how that kind of violent energy played out within the WWE itself, beyond the ring?', 'Riesman: Oh, of course. Vince would be the first to tell you that he ruled his company like a dictator. Maybe a Roman consul along with Linda at times, but Linda was never the dictator in creative, which is the product itself. Vince always had the last word there, often to the detriment of everyone beneath him.', 'Wrestling has really been an extension of Vince McMahon’s psyche. There are plenty of elements that predate him, but the emphasis on blatant misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, racism, all of that stuff, reads like this is one person working out his issues. That became especially true when Vince made himself the central character in WWF/WWE when he became “Mr. McMahon” and had, at various times, every storyline orbiting around him. Now, was the character entirely reflective of who he was? That’s a separate question. But he was still the one performing that character and driving that character. And it was massively consequential.', 'CNN: One of the things I don’t fully understand about all this is how McMahon stepped down once, and TKO even acknowledged that his alleged behavior was a financial liability, but they let him come back anyway.', 'Riesman: I don’t think they really knew what they were getting into. The corporate suits at Endeavor (which merged with WWE to form TKO) have not dealt with the depths of depravity that exist in wrestling.', 'My guess is they went into this thinking they had a standard-issue alleged predator problem. And then they found out they had a wrestling-level alleged predator problem. Wrestling is a very weird, idiosyncratic space that Vince has done his best to dress up as just another corporate media or athletics entity.', 'CNN: It feels almost like an anachronism in 2024. But Netflix is betting on a renaissance for the art form. Are you optimistic about that?', 'Riesman: There’s a real chance at some kind of renaissance. But the industry is about to face some serious scrutiny in lawsuits and from the federal government. The Vince McMahon story is not over. There are going to be a lot of challenges to come. And I genuinely don’t know what the future of TKO/WWE looks like.', 'CNN: A lot has happened in the relatively short time since your book came out last year. Are you updating it?', 'Riesman: An expanded paperback with an afterword coming out on April 16. It will still be a little out of date because this is just such a rolling train wreck — but trust me there’s an update.', 'CNN: Final question: Who is your favorite wrestler?', 'Riesman: The Hebrew Champion, Sammy Stein — he wrestled in the ’30s.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is NFLX Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.5% over the past month to $16.93.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Netflix.

If it succeeds, it'll be showing up to the market late, and it'll need to clear the high bar of proving that its product is worth using instead of the mainstays."", ""Is its stock worth buying on what appears to be its long shot at accessing a market that's already white-hot? The answer might surprise you."", ""While there's no guarantee that making a better medicine than the existing set of weight-loss drugs will succeed, there are a few pieces of information that suggest, even at this early stage, that Amgen's entrant might be a winner. Its anti-obesity candidate is called MariTide, and it's currently in phase 2 clinical trials. What makes MariTide special is that it uses an overlapping but slightly different, and possibly more favorable, mechanism of action than Wegovy and Zepbound do."", ""Much like those two medicines, MariTide targets the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) on the cells of the pancreas. But while Eli Lilly's Zepbound activates another cellular feature called the glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide receptor (GIP-R), Amgen's program takes the opposite approach, aiming to block GIP-R so its activity is curbed rather than accelerated."", ""You are probably rightfully wondering how two opposite approaches could lead to the same physiological result: the patient experiencing weight loss. Such questions have not yet been answered although they're under active investigation by researchers. But these biopharmas aren't just taking shots in the dark; there's evidence from both humans and animal models that Amgen's method is capable of driving robust weight loss."", 'Per early clinical-stage data the company published on Feb. 5 in the prestigious journal Nature Metabolism, study participants who received multiple doses of MariTide over the course of three months lost an an average of 14.5% of their body weight by the 85th day. Critically, those patients appeared to keep the majority of the lost weight off after dosing was stopped although longer-term data is needed to confirm this finding, and work on that front is ongoing.', 'The implication is that the drug could have an edge over Zepbound and Wegovy, as patients using those drugs typically start to regain the weight they lost as soon as they stop receiving doses.', ""In the fourth quarter, Amgen will report results of the phase 2 study, which should clear the issue up somewhat. It'll also be moving another candidate for weight loss into its first clinical trials. Much as with Zepbound and Wegovy's sibling medicines that are indicated for treating type 2 diabetes -- Mounjaro and Ozempic -- management is eager to investigate any opportunities to target additional indications with its candidate once it enters late-stage trials."", 'Needless to say, getting approval to sell the medicine for any indications beyond obesity would mean massively expanding its addressable market. So if the phase 2 data look favorable, this stock could go on a bull run.', ""Now let's move on to the question of whether Amgen's attempt to one-up Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk makes it worth investing in, starting with a look at the financial stakes involved."", ""In Q4 alone, Novo Nordisk sold nearly $1.4 billion worth of Wegovy doses, and demand is expected to remain stronger than the company can meet, given its manufacturing capacity, at least through 2024. According to financial analysts at Morgan Stanley, by 2030 weight-loss drugs could be a market that's as large as $77 billion annually, up from $2.4 billion in 2022. So there's almost certainly more than enough room for another competitor to take a slice of that market, both today and in the future."", ""In 2023, Amgen brought in $28.1 billion in revenue. If it eventually commercializes MariTide a couple of years from now, which is not at all guaranteed, it would only need to capture a sliver of the market to make billions more. Even matching Wegovy's sales today would be a meaningful amount of additional revenue, and would be hugely positive for the stock."", ""Furthermore, Amgen's valuation is much more reasonable today than those of either Novo Nordisk or Eli Lilly. Whereas its price to earnings (P/E) ratio is 23, Novo Nordisk's is 44, and Lilly's is a sky-high 130. In other words, the company is ripe for a bet because it could experience major growth, but it isn't yet priced accordingly."", ""In short, if you're looking for exposure to the weight-loss market, or even if you're just looking for a stalwart stock to be a reliable compounder for your portfolio, Amgen looks like a great choice right now. It doesn't need to decisively win the upcoming competitive fight in order to win for its shareholders. And even if it fails with MariTide, it has so many products and so many other programs in its pipeline that it could still be a strong performer."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amgen right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amgen, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amgen wasn’t one of them.

Latigo Biotherapeutics, which, like Amgen, is based in Thousand Oaks, California, quickly hired some of those former Amgen scientists to jump-start its own neuroscience plans.', '“We were fortunate that, just at that moment, Amgen strategically exited neuroscience and laid off a lot of really good people into the local community here, including folks I knew quite well from my days as head of R&D at Amgen,” said Sean Harper, who after leaving Amgen in 2018 became co-founding managing director of venture firm Westlake Village Biopartners.', 'Westlake created Latigo and later led a $135 million fundraising that gave the startup the resources to build a pipeline of painkillers it hopes could yield a non-addictive alternative to opioids like Vicodin. On Wednesday, the company debuted publicly, revealing the Series A financing as well as its lead drug candidate.', 'Latigo’s pitch is similar to one from Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which last month released late-stage trial results showing a non-opioid treatment it developed could alleviate pain following surgery. Vertex plans to soon ask for regulatory approval for the drug, which, if cleared, would be the first of its type.', 'Latigo’s target is the same as Vertex’s: a kind of molecular “gate” found in certain nerve cells that relays pain signals to the brain. This gate, a sodium channel known as NaV1.8, is only found in peripheral nerve cells, meaning drugs that block it could avoid the kind of brain-involved side effects that make opioids dangerous.', 'Vertex’s results provided clinical validation of a hypothesis that was already well supported by genetic data. They also set a high bar for success. And with a drug ready for regulatory review, Vertex has established a sizable head start on any competition.', 'Even so, Latigo claims there’s room to improve on its larger rival’s treatment.', ""“When a new category opens up like this, somebody makes a first-in-class molecule. Occasionally, that's the best-in-class, but most of the time something else comes along that is more refined,” said Harper. “So we're really focused on the differentiation that we can bring to the table.”"", 'Latigo’s lead drug, dubbed LTG-001, is currently in a Phase 1 study. The company is preparing to advance it into a mid-stage trial in acute pain, such as after bunion or stomach surgeries. Testing in chronic pain is also part of the plan, said Desmond Padhi, interim CEO and an operating partner at Westlake.', 'According to Padhi, preclinical data has shown LTG-001 to be highly selective for NaV1.8, avoiding penetration into the brain and the side effects that would go with it. He also noted early safety data suggesting Latigo could explore a wide range of doses.', 'Selectivity was also prioritized by Vertex’s chemists, who crafted a molecule that’s at least 30,000 times more selective for NaV1.8 than eight other sodium channels. The Massachusetts company is working on successor molecules, too.', 'Harper describes such selectivity for NaV1.8 as “table stakes” for companies who, like Latigo, hope to follow Vertex. Still, he noted questions that remain unanswered, such as whether the several hours it took for Vertex’s compound to provide relief in testing reflect the Nav1.8 approach or the drug.', ""“We think it's possible that could be a molecule attribute,” said Harper. “We think it's possible that you could get a faster onset with a different molecule, along with perhaps more efficacy by being able to push dose safely in the chronic setting.”"", 'Latigo, which currently has 26 employees, has to prove that in testing. But investor interest is high, said board chair and Neuron23 CEO Nancy Stagliano, giving Latigo options for further fundraising.', ""“I do think the potential here is to raise capital via a number of vehicles,” said Stagliano. “It's now going to be a question of what the company views as the best situation.”"", 'A more immediate priority is finding a permanent CEO to take over for Padhi, who still has his job at Westlake. Latigo is looking for a candidate who has both private and public company experience, according to Stagliano.', 'In addition to Westlake, 5AM Ventures, Foresite Capital and Corner Ventures also invested in Latigo’s Series A.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

Experts often recommend prioritizing companies that demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payouts over time. Nevertheless, there is also notable interest among investors in companies offering high dividend yields. Over time, high-yielding stocks and companies with consistent dividend growth have demonstrated comparable performance, showing a close race in their investment returns. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series employs a distinctive methodology aimed at tracking the performance of 100 stocks with high dividend yields across various markets. These stocks are chosen based on their consistent history of dividend payments and strong fundamental metrics. Over the long term, this index has demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains compared to standard benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index achieved an annualized total return of 11.7%, surpassing its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which yielded 10.2% annually. Similarly, in the international market, the Dow Jones International Dividend 100 Index outperformed its benchmark, the S&P Global Ex-U.S. LargeMidCap, in both price return and total return over the past 15 years.', 'Heartland Advisors conducted an in-depth analysis utilizing data provided by Kenneth French, sourced from the US Stock Database Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. This dataset encompassed all equity securities listed on major US exchanges, including NYSE, Amex, NASDAQ, and NYSE Arca, spanning from 1928 through 2017. The study focused on examining monthly and annual value-weighted total returns of non-dividend-paying U.S. stocks and five portfolios consisting of dividend-paying stocks. These portfolios were constructed based on dividend yields. The research tracked the performance of each portfolio from January 1928 to December 2017, with dividends reinvested. Notably, the findings revealed that all portfolios comprising dividend-paying stocks outperformed the portfolio comprised solely of non-dividend-paying stocks over the entire period studied. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, in general, portfolios with higher dividend yields tended to outperform those with lower dividend yields. This suggests a positive correlation between dividend yield and investment performance, with higher-yielding quintiles demonstrating stronger returns compared to lower-yielding quintiles.', ""The impressive performance of high-yielding dividend stocks has garnered significant popularity among investors, leading many to turn to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a key source for such investment opportunities. Employing a strategy known as the 'Dogs of the Dow', investors focus on acquiring the highest-yielding stocks within the DJIA. The outcomes of this strategy have been varied and inconsistent over time. According to data sourced from Barron's in one of our articles, over a 20-year period ending in 2023, the Dogs of the Dow strategy yielded an average annual return slightly above 8%, inclusive of dividends. This performance lags behind the S&P 500 by a little over 1% annually.

Since the turn of the millennium, there has been a roughly 33% increase in global energy consumption, with expectations of ongoing growth in the coming years. Projections indicate that global energy usage will reach 580 million terajoules annually, equivalent to roughly 580 million trillion joules or approximately 13,865 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). This colossal financial commitment underscores the paramount importance of energy in the intricate tapestry of global economies. According to Enerdata the Japanese, Americans, and Europeans significantly outspend other regions globally, with their expenditures ranging between three to four times the world average. On a per capita basis, their spending falls within the range of 2,500 to 3,500 US dollars, far exceeding the global average.', 'The projected growth of the global Energy as a Service Market indicates an increase from USD 70.46 billion in 2022 to USD 147.56 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.1% throughout the forecast period. Several key factors contribute to this projected expansion, including notable advancements in renewable energy technologies, the widespread implementation of smart grid systems, and a growing emphasis on energy efficiency initiatives. These influential factors underscore a transformative shift towards sustainable and efficient energy practices, shaping the trajectory of the global energy consumption market over the next decade.', ""The United States, renowned as one of the world's foremost industrial powerhouses, boasts the largest economy globally.

Furthermore, despite an overall plateau in total US manufacturing output in the second quarter of 2023, specific sectors such as motor vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing experienced notable surges of 11.3% and 6.7%, respectively. This has attributed to legislative initiatives like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America (CHIPS) Act. This dynamic landscape underscores the nation's commitment to technological advancements and sustainable practices in its quest for economic prosperity."", 'The increasing global momentum is hastening the shift towards cleaner energy sources, as demonstrated by the UAE Consensus presented at COP28 on December 13, 2023. The consensus urged parties to take decisive actions, including tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. It also emphasized expediting the reduction of unabated coal power and transitioning to net-zero emission energy systems by utilizing low-carbon fuels well before mid-century. Additionally, it advocated for a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuels, aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.', 'Acknowledging this transition, there is potential for renewables to gain market competitiveness as they expand, while fossil fuels decrease.

Today, we reported strong full year results, driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for our innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% in the U.S. and 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species and therapeutic areas has sustained our performance further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential and growing industry. Our track record of innovation from pioneering breakthroughs to product life cycle enhancements has solidified our position as the industry leader consistently growing above the market and enabled us to create market-leading franchises. We don't just follow trends, we make markets. The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first 2 injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats and strengthening the human animal bond. That's why today, Librela remains the #1 selling OA pain product in Europe. At Investor Day last May and again at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our [own pain] franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion. And we are excited about Librela's performance since its U.S. launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth. Similarly, Solensia has also been well received with strong clinic penetration around the world with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain in cats.Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians. And after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. increasing pet owners' awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improve compliance and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs underpins our optimism. We remain confident that we can sustain growth, thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticide portfolio and particularly Simparica Trio remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position, but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine. As we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human animal bond and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance. Our dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility, outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage, and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chain and commercial excellence to cultivate new markets, drive growth and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers while performing above the market. Our focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In closing, we will continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis.

Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world in humankind by advancing care for animal and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio and defend our position amidst competition. I want to reiterate the 4 tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and you will return excess capital to shareholders. While there is need and demand to improve the quality life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth.

As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023 with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad with strong growth across both our U.S. and international segments, with our companion animal and livestock portfolios and due to both price and volume. Full year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal bodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio. On a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our International segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business and represented a 0.5 percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Our livestock portfolio also had a strong year with operational growth of 6%.Performance in companion animal was led by OA pain mAbs, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the U.S. We continue to see penetration of our pain mAbs grow within vet clinics and a high level of satisfaction amongst both vets and pet owners. Our key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 7% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international. Our livestock portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both the reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in U.S. companion animals. Adjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both the reported and on operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth consisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our in-line products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter. On a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while International segment reported revenue of $982 million with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed with operational growth of 6%. We saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our international segment, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain mAbs were the primary driver of growth posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 full launch of Librela in the U.S. Simparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as some increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international. Our livestock products ended the year on a strong note with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our U.S. and International segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from [DRAXXIN] price decreases as well as by volume with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal sales growing 10% and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by a full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, all while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier-than-normal preprice buy-in at the end of last year. In the U.S., vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year. While we continue to see solid clinic revenue and revenue per visit growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our U.S. companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace its veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics as well as our strong presence in the retail channel. Moving on to product performance. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our pain mAbs, Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain mAbs posted $58 million in U.S. sales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the U.S. early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in U.S. sales in the quarter which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain mAbs, there's significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher-than-expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year as well as rapid patient share growth in the Canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the U.S. We have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the U.S., feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%. Growth was driven primarily by price as we ran promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges, and in advance of a [than] expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter with competition in the trio combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships and a significant advantage of being first to market.Dermatology products sales in the U.S. were $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume with vets and pet owners referring this injectable method of administration. [Simparica] franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. U.S. livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotation back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix as well as share gains due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally and livestock grew 7% operationally. China represented a 3% drag on our International segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain mAbs, our key dermatology products and our small animal parasiticides portfolio. Growth in our OA pain products was equally driven by (inaudible) focus and DTC awareness campaign in early launch European markets as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million internationally with 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million of revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis. We continue to see benefits to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets, and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth in Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong parasiticide season and demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness. This growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our revolution franchise which generates a high proportion of sales in China, where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022 as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing onto international livestock, which grew 7% operationally driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio.Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which grew 10% operationally primarily due to higher competition-related expenses as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation. R&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher competition-related expenses as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, Other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition.The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, an a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher [than net] dispute tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. Adjusted net income grew 6% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders. For the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase. continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income.Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2024. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. On adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points. with significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX. So these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January.For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and [$9.225 billion], representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth with growth across both price and volume. We expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the U.S. launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our OA pain mAbs both in the U.S. and internationally. Our current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the U.S. are exceeding our expectations. And as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrants, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and in our key dermatology portfolio. For livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we enter 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with livestock industry growth.I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. For companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect U.S. visits to grow flat to 1% and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our OA pain products. For our companion animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio. We expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination (inaudible) parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In our key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our 3 differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023.Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower [stat utilization.] This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase in 2023, focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects as well as higher competition related expenses.Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million. This is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the nonrecurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023 as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market. And growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $5.84 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth.To summarize, 2023 was another strong year. Even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China. We again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future. As we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders.Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.', 'Erin Elizabeth Wilson Wright', 'So can you talk a little bit about the reorder rates and feedback and expectations around Librela for 2024 in the U.S. and some of those stocking dynamics that we should think about quarter-to-quarter. And then a bigger picture question just on margins and profitability, and there are some moving factors in 2024, such as FX and the ramp-up of Librela that weigh on margins. But can you talk a little bit more about the potential margin leverage that you could see across your business as you expand in some of those faster-growing and higher-margin categories in 2025 and beyond? And if you could describe a little bit more about that longer-term margin leverage.', 'Kristin C. Peck', ""Thank you, Erin. I will take the first question on Librela and let Wetteny take that second question. Yes, we were very pleased with how we did with Librela in the first full quarter of launch in Q4. As you saw, we did about $44 million in the quarter, $47 million for the year, including the early experience trial. And really how we achieved that was our penetration was ahead of schedule, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we -- given that penetration, which is in the high 60s, we actually began DTC ahead of what we were expecting. Reorder rates are coming in exactly where we expected in line with our expectations. So that makes us really confident as we go into the year. We're looking at what -- your other question was what kind of stocking or inventory build we saw in the clinic. It's hard to give you a firm number. It's somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3. I would say, overall in stocking. But look, this is the #1 selling pain product in Europe, and we have no doubt it will be that in the U.S. as well. So we're quite pleased and certainly ahead of our plan on penetration. And look with our direct-to-consumer advertising investments we've already started late last year and into Q1 to drive growth in this product in the U.S.So I'll let Wetteny take the second question?"", 'Wetteny N. Joseph', ""Yes, sure. Look, when looking at margins, yes, indeed, there are some moving factors when you think about 2024 and then beyond, we do have Librela in 2023, as we've said at Investor Day, if you look at our monoclonal antibodies at peak, particularly as we ramp up production in our capacity, which was built to make sure that we're confident in being able to take advantage of demand. They started being dilutive to the overall company average, for example, in 2023. As we go through 2024, Librela becomes accretive to our overall margins, but still below whether you would consider our innovative companion animal products. And as we exit '24 into 2025 and beyond, it becomes more in line with our innovative companion animal products.So overall, beyond '24, I won't give you specific guidance here in terms of what to expect. But I think if you look at it, we continue to expect companion animal to outpace the growth of livestock. So that mix will continue to be favorable for us. And as we get into the higher levels of production from monoclonal antibodies, they are also accretive to overall margins. And we're positioned to be able to leverage our SG&A base as well. So all of those should translate to margin expansion through the P&L over time. But as we've demonstrated, we're not afraid to make the right investments behind our products, behind our key franchises as we see them, investments in R&D, as you saw in 2023. And as the guide implies, R&D will continue to grow faster than revenue as well. So those investments will slightly offset some of those, but we're positioned to continue to expand."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America."", 'Michael Leonidovich Ryskin', ""First, I want to touch on margins maybe both for 2023 and 2024. So it looks like you're guiding back in the [analogue math] you're guiding to about 100 bps of margin expansion in 2024. But you also did finish '23 lower than we would have expected. I think 4Q especially came in significantly lower. And you called out some headwinds during the call in terms of FX. You call out some timing, some contribution to the Zoetis Charitable Foundation. Any way you could kind of back that out, give us sort of a cleaner number for what margins should have been in '23? And then maybe what some of those onetime headwinds would have as an impact to 2024. Just to give us a better sense of underlying margins and underlying EPS.And then my second question is just following up on Librela. I don't believe you actually quantified the target. So I want to -- just given what you did in 4Q, a major focus point. Is something like $200 million to $250 million for Librela for 2024 reasonable? And especially that's for U.S., but then on the OUS side, we've heard some concerns maybe coming out of the Europe and it seems like Librela has sort of been a little bit flat over the last couple of quarters in international markets. So any color on what's going on internationally?"", 'Wetteny N. Joseph', ""Yes, sure, Mike. Let me take this and then see what Kristin wants to add. So take a look at margins. Indeed, in 2024, we are guiding to about 100 basis points of expansion in margins. Keep in mind, when you look at 2023 and how we ended, Q4 had about 100 basis points of margin impact and about 80 of that is from FX. So you're talking about roughly 20 basis points when you consider manufacturing costs and a little bit of mix. Now looking at mix, we had clearly really strong and quite frankly, a strong year in livestock. And we're actually here at the national sales meeting for our livestock with our livestock team in Utah, and look, they've had a great year, and we expect livestock continue to grow as we go into 2024, but clearly ended stronger at the end. So that created a little bit of a mix. Yes, and as well as Librela outperforming our expectations exiting the year is also, as I said, a bit dilutive. So when you look at mix and manufacturing costs, you're still talking about 20 basis points of headwind exiting '23. Most of the impact here is coming from FX about 80 basis points.The other items that we referenced in our prepared commentary with respect to impact on the quarter and how we ended FX as I just said that has the impact on our finish here. If you take a look at FX, which is clearly nonoperational and you factor nonrecurring items like the impairment charge for the prior acquisition. Those 2 items are about $0.07 of headwind in the quarter in 2023 in the fourth quarter. So that's really the vast majority of what you saw impacting us here. Of course, we don't forecast FX. So what we bake into our guidance for 2024 is essentially what would happen if we assume FX rates stay where they are. at the end of January here. And with that, on a constant basis, we would expect to expand margins in 2024. And so that's really consistent with how we've approached our forecasting in the past, and I will sit here and guess what FX is going to do throughout the year 2024, and that will have an impact either favorable or unfavorable, depending on how that goes.For the other part of your question, I just want to maybe talk a little bit about Librela, how we expect Librela? Clearly, when you think about how we will deliver on 7% to 9% operational growth in revenue. Price is a pretty significant factor. We continue to expect to be running price above our historic levels of 2 to 3 points. And perhaps slightly below what you saw in 2023 at 5%. And then Librela with the U.S. launch, clearly is going to be a significant factor. Certainly $44 million in the quarter and Q4 was, again, very pleased to see that. We do see about 1/4 to 1/3 of that being initial stocking. So you can model that out in terms of what that would translate to. We're still in the early stages of our launch, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far as we discussed already. In international, we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing.If you look at international, the fourth quarter you still have about 47% growth if you look at the base markets where we were launched at the beginning of the year. And then the new markets are driving another bit of growth. You have another $12 million contribution from those new markets in addition to the U.S. $44 million. So I think what we have to really take into account here is as we've been launching in markets. In Europe, there's some stocking that happens from quarter-to-quarter as we do those launches. If you factor those out and you just focus on those markets that we've already launched. We're talking about 47% growth in the quarter, which has been consistent over the last few quarters about [50%] give or take growth. So we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing in the international markets."", 'Operator', ""We'll move next to Jon Block with Stifel."", 'Jonathan David Block', ""Wetteny, any revenue cadence in the year to call out? You've got sort of the easier 1Q '23 comp, but you were also noting more acute China headwinds in the first half. So just -- how do we think about it? Do we sort of look at it on a 2-year stack basis? And a bit on the guidance for the full year, maybe GM, we're a little bit below what we were thinking. But SG&A expense despite the investments, Kristin, that you called out, the accelerated DTC, the SG&A was a little bit lower than where our heads were at. So maybe you can just talk through those items why we're only seeing seems like low to mid-single-digit SG&A growth year-over-year. I don't know if some of that's blunted by FX? And then just finally, I'm sorry, Librela, due to the stocking, do you still expect Librela to be up in the U.S. 4Q '23 to 1Q '24 as it absorbs the stocking?"", 'Wetteny N. Joseph', ""Look, I'll take the cadence point first and then see what Kristin wants to add in terms of Librela expectations. Look, sitting here, I would expect a roughly balanced cadence across the year. Now let's take a look at Q1, which is a specific point you raised in your question, Jon. If you look in Q1, certainly if you look at companion animal in the U.S., this is an easier comp. We had destocking in the first quarter last year. clearly something we look to see as an easier comp we come up against. But at the same time, you had a 12% growth quarter in livestock in Q1. And so I think if you look to balance -- complete the balance, but it's livestock growth both in the U.S. as well as international. And then you have China, which clearly started to more deteriorate in terms of the economic conditions there throughout the year. So that becomes a heavier I would say, headwind coming into Q1 as well as the conditions -- weather conditions in Australia, et cetera, are having an impact there. So I think if you balance those out and last point I'll make is, Librela, clearly very pleased with how we exit Q4 and enter into Q1 but it's going to continue to contribute more and more as you go through the year. So Q2 and Q3 would be more than Q1.Therefore, the contribution from Librela accelerates through the year again it doesn't have as much relative to speaking in Q1. So when you take all those into consideration, I actually see a roughly balanced year. Now we did make references to FX. So from a reported basis, that, again, taking a look at where the FX rates were a couple of weeks ago, you do have a heavier impact in terms of both revenue and bottom line. When FX de facto, hopefully, what we provide in prepared commentary is helpful there. So that's the other piece you have to think about. But when I think about operational base growth, I mean, we did exit the year with good momentum as we exited Q4 and [it's] Q1, again, looking at U.S. companion animal, but that's how I think about it.Now is Q1 is going to be higher than Q4 from a Librela perspective? I think if you factor about a [1/4] to a [1/3] of impact coming from stock, and that's $12 million to $15 million. So even if you had a flat that means you grew by $12 million to $15 million going into Q1. I won't call it exactly here. Right now, what I would say is we're pleased with how the product is performing, but we are still in the early stages of this launch."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler."", 'David Michael Westenberg', ""So last year, we saw some discounting in front of the NexGard combo launch. Do you anticipate there might be similar competitive dynamics in front of Elanco's Quattro launch? And how are you thinking about that in consideration with the gross margins? And then just a second one on just the DTC efforts on Librela. I don't think there is DC allowed in Europe. But can you talk about maybe some of the learnings that you learned in Europe in terms of marketing and how they might apply specifically around communication of the vet obviously is the one that understands the superior safety profile with monoclonal antibodies and maybe how that messaging can come out?"", 'Kristin C. Peck', ""Sure. I'll start with that one and Wetteny can certainly build on it. I mean I want to first underscore, we had a very strong Q4 with Trio with 21% growth in the quarter with competition. For the year, overall Trio grew 9%. So we're very pleased with that as we guided and Wetteny mentioned earlier, we're expecting mid- to high single-digit growth in Trio for the year. So this obviously underscores and we think we'll see that both in price and in volume. So we do anticipate, obviously, a competitor entering I'm not exactly sure what -- how Credelio Quattro will do it. Our expectation is that is not a differentiated product. They do mention tapeworm, but you get tapeworm from fleas then we actually control fleas. So therefore, that's really not a differentiated product. So we are used to having good competitors, obviously, with NexGard, I'm sure there'll be some heavy promotional. But I think our strength, honestly, with our corporate accounts, the experience switching is low for people with this product. It's very unlikely someone on Trio is going to switch. We're doing quite well with retail and auto ship, which I think also protects us. And we expect a new competitor to expand the market.What we're seeing a lot is a movement into the triple combos out of topicals, collars, et cetera. So as we look at that, we're confident in our Trio number as we look into the year. And with regards to your question on what have we learned from Librela in Europe? So we cannot do branded advertising for Librela in Europe, but we can do overall advertising for disease awareness and encouraging people who have pets both dogs and cats with osteoarthritis pain to bring them to the vet. And we are seeing real impact of that disease awareness. I think it's been a long time where pet owners have not had a product that they could turn to and encouraging them that there is a new product and then they should go to the vet and be seen. We are seeing really positive uplift from direct-to-consumer advertising even when it's not branded. So I don't know Wetteny, if you want to add into that?"", 'Wetteny N. Joseph', ""Look, I think you covered it Kristin. Trio has been performing really well for us in the face of drug competition in the U.S. couldn't be more pleased. And to be gaining patient share in the face of competition. I think that speaks a lot to what we've been talking about, which is the power of our relationships, the strength of our label and being first to market. So look, there'll be some initial, I'm sure, heavy promotion that happens when a new competitor comes in with factor some of that into our thinking here. But until we see the label and see what they do, we won't hold in on specific reaction and so on, but we're very confident in our ability to grow continued growth franchise, and we're saying we're going to see mid- to single-digit growth across Trio in 2024 as well."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs."", 'Nathan Allen Rich', ""I wanted to ask on the Derm franchise. I think you had talked about mid- to high single-digit growth for the franchise overall. I guess, specifically, are you assuming a headwind within that guidance from the competitive entry that's likely to occur against Apoquel this year? And can you talk about the strategies you're maybe putting in place to defend market share for that product? And then a quick follow-up on China. Could you maybe frame the type of headwind that you expect in China in 2024? And does that impact more on the companion or livestock side of the market?"", 'Kristin C. Peck', ""Sure. I'll take the derm question, and I think Wetteny can follow up on your China question. Look, we saw strong growth both in the quarter and overall in derm at 8%. And I just want to underscore that, that growth is obviously understated given the price -- if you're looking at the prepriced buy-in that we saw in late 2022. As we look at our guidance for mid- to high single-digit growth for our derm franchise in 2024, that is the expectation that we will see a competitor launch. We expect this market to continue to expand and grow as we've talked about. There are 85 million dogs in the U.S. You have pruritus. There is still over 6 million untreated dogs and 3.5 million who are treated but with steroids and sort of over-the-counter products. So we strongly believe this is a market we can continue to expand.Look, we've had 2 products been on the market, 7 and 10 years, respectively. We've had millions of dogs on these products. Our products have been proven over time to be safe and efficacious and they're trusted by pet owners. They're trusted by vets. And we're seeing more and more a switch to Cytopoint, build a preference for compliance by both the pet owner and the vet, and our competition, we're expecting to come in a film-coated tablet. And if you look at that, we're really focused on investing in Apoquel chewable and moving them to chewable pet owners really prefer. We've been successful in doing this in Europe. We're quite focused on doing this in the U.S. And we're also continuing to look at innovation in the short term on the long-acting. So we are going to defend this franchise. We're confident in this franchise, our guidance of mid- to high single digits demonstrates that we believe we can continue to grow this market in the U.S. and around the world, not just defend our brand, but continue to bring life cycle innovation to the space over time to grow our share.Wetteny, do you want to take China?"", 'Wetteny N. Joseph', ""Yes, sure. And one point on derm of course, we have a mid- to high single-digit growth expectation that we laid out in our guidance. of course, across a broad range of expectation there, there's various scenarios around competitor entry, timing, pricing, et cetera, will play into that and the label that they have, of course, will be playing into how that plays out. But we're confident in our ability to grow. Our franchise has been around for a decade in this space.On China, we've been consistent on this one. I think we continue to see sort of the broad economic situation there to remain where it is. We're not expecting to deteriorate nor improve at least through the first half of our year, and we also have stronger comps similar to the second half of 2023, little bit less so into the first half of '24, but still a headwind into the first half of '24. You continue to see consumer confidence being low and swine prices are remaining fairly depressed in consumption there as well. So all those factors, of course, in long term, we continue to expect China to be a strong growth market. It has done exceptionally well for us over the last decade. But in the near term, we're not expecting that to be a contribution to growth. In fact, we'll see some declining comps in the first half on China."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays."", 'Balaji V. Prasad', ""A couple. Firstly, I just wanted to understand the currency dynamics better, considering that most of the nearly 100 basis points return revenue and 150 basis points yet on EPS seems to be going from here. Why is FX so severe and any particular currencies hurting you? I mean my general understanding is with $4 billion of -- $4-plus billion of export revenues and dollar weakening, I thought the impact would have been the other way around. Second question is around the FDA letter that Zoetis received on Librela in November. I wanted to understand how frequent or normal are these kinds of letters on the animal health side and the issues that FDA found with Librela's promotion with the inclusion of the P value on the secondary end points, and what is the current status now with regard to your communication with FDA."", 'Kristin C. Peck', ""Sure Balaji, so I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take it. I see you're referencing the letter back in November. Honestly, the letter is uneventful and was well addressed. We immediately resolved the request for clarification, what you're talking about is a request for clarification on our promotional materials. We just made a minor change to the promotional materials and how we represented some statistical data. The concerns are well addressed and the modifications were accepted by the FDA. I mean this isn't uncommon. So I don't -- that was easily resolved last year, that was a minor issue.But Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?"", 'Wetteny N. Joseph', ""Yes, sure. On currency dynamics. And again, we don't forecast FX. So we tend to report out what we see the impact is. And the dollar continues to strengthen against the number of currencies that we operate in. And there's a little bit of a disproportional effect that we see on some of the higher inflationary markets like Argentina, if you follow Argentina, there have been 2 really significant drops in terms of FX rates versus the dollar, if you follow back as we ended last year, both in December and I think back in August. And there's a little bit of a delayed effect on those clearly there's an impact on top line that we've talked about. But there's also a little bit of a delayed effect if you look at the impact it has on inventory and receivables that are on the books at the time. So by the time you collect those, they have a greater impact, which is why you see the impact down to bottom line. So combinations [volumes.] Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, those are more pronounced in their relative percentage of our revenues, given how significantly they [de-value.] That's what you're seeing play out. But really across the board, if you look at how the dollar ended the year, it ended a bit stronger than you saw throughout the average of the year."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair."", 'Brandon Vazquez', ""First, can you talk a little bit about the prepriced buying in the quarter. Are you able to quantify how much of a headwind that was? And then maybe talk about should we expect that to be a headwind going forward at all? Are you guys still working through that? And a follow-up to that, just maybe higher level. Is there anything in the pipeline or kind of in product cycle management that you guys can share with us, you're still spending a lot of money in R&D and even for next year, it looks like that may not be a specific area to get leverage off of the R&D line. So anything that you'd be able to share with us there would be helpful."", 'Wetteny N. Joseph', ""Yes, sure. I'll take the first one and then Kristin will cover the second one. Look, there's always some level of prepriced buying in our -- as we exit the year given where what our price increases are going to be I would say, compared to the prior year where there was higher than average reprice buying as seen in 2022 into 2023, which had the impact on '24, we more actively managed customer orders in terms of reprice buying exiting 2023. And that gave us really first, the underlying market strength and momentum that we carried into but also, I would say, our quarter position walking into January 2024, we're certainly in a better position than, say, the prior year. So we more actively manage those, but there's always some level in the numbers."", 'Kristin C. Peck', ""Sure. And the question with regards to R&D. Obviously, we are very confident in our pipeline. I think we've been the most innovative company in animal health. And if you look at the -- how we exceeded market growth every year for the last 11 years, it is due to the innovation in our pipeline. We are investing both for the short, medium and long term. In animal health, different than human health, that really makes a difference. You look at sort of what I call like life cycle enhancements that we just launched such as Apoquel chewable, which will significantly support our key brands. We're also looking at pretty disruptive innovations as well. As you look at sort of the short 1- to 3-year term of innovation, we're excited really for some of our long acting. And we've talked a lot about investing in the medium to long term and really important new franchises as well, such as renal, chronic kidney disease spaces, looking at cardiology, looking at oncology and diabetes, there's really important spaces of unmet medical need in animal health that we're really excited to tackle. We're continuing to invest behind our diagnostics as well as behind our livestock business. Looking at new vaccines and immunomodulators in our genetics business. So we have a very diverse pipeline because we have a diverse portfolio. So we're continuing to invest behind that and remain very confident in that."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan."", 'Christopher Thomas Schott', ""Just 2 for me. Just latest on vet visit growth. I know it's not the primary driver of growth for your business, but you're targeting 0% to 1% this year. I'm just trying to get more color on what is the underlying kind of dynamics here. Is this mostly still vet capacity? Is it macro dynamics? Just any color there would be appreciated. And then my second question was just coming back to Librela ex U.S. From your perspective, how penetrated is the market for monoclonals at this point? And where do you see the largest opportunity for growth in these markets? I'm showing a sense of like we're in the second inning or the seventh inning of the ramp ex U.S."", 'Kristin C. Peck', ""Sure. I mean, starting on the first, we are not very levered as we've spoken about many times before to vet business. I mean obviously, they're not inconsequential our view of 0% to 1% is that's where it's historically been. That is historically what you see in vet clinic visits over time. So I think we're really saying it's back to normal. What's really happening is there's strong end market demand. There remains some capacity issues in the U.S. But I think some of that's being addressed by more stuff going to auto ship and retail and online, which has also been supporting it. But we really sort of view the year as you look into the year for 2023, although we saw flat vet visits, we saw revenue and revenue per visit up 7.5%. So we really are seeing really strong growth, obviously, overall in revenue, and we're much more correlated over time with that, just given the strength of our portfolio, et cetera.And to your second question with regards to Librela outside the U.S., I think we're still early innings. And really where I think we see the growth is right now, that product is primarily being used in severe dogs. I think getting it into more moderate dogs. I mean, I think, obviously, at least somewhere -- I mean in my 50s, I will say, my hip hurts right now. But everyone doesn't know that is around me. And so the reality is osteoarthritis exists in animals long before they're limping and can't walk up the stairs. And the more we can control that pain early, I think, is critical. So I think what we're really trying to change the paradigm is getting Librela in first-line use for animals with osteoarthritis pain and getting it into more of those moderate dogs. And we think we more -- we can do that, the more we can continue to grow the market here and grow our franchise. So we know, we believe we're in early innings across the globe with regards to osteoarthritis pain with both Librela and certainly with Solensia, where we still have to continue to grow awareness for osteoarthritis pain in cats."", 'Operator', ""We'll now take our next question from Stephen Scala with TD Cowen."", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'This is Chris on for Steve. We have 2 questions. First, on Librela. To what degree are U.S. debt capacity constraints, the headwind to longer-term treatment compliance? And then is there a regulatory path for the approval of an at-home administrative formulation?', 'Kristin C. Peck', ""Sure. Obviously, making sure that pet owners can get in monthly for their injections is critical. So vet capacity is certainly something that we're quite focused on. But I think after the first visit, this is an injection that can certainly be done by a vet tech. And I think the industry is really focused, and we've been partnering with corporates the AVMA with lots of people to really think about how to change the paradigm of vets to vet techs and clinics and things like that. So we believe there are solutions to really address some of the vet capacity issues. So far, globally, and by the way, this vet capacity issue is not just a U.S. issue, it's global. So far, it hasn't affected the growth of our key products. And your second question is with regard to home delivery. You want to take that one?"", 'Wetteny N. Joseph', ""Yes. Look, I think the regulatory path to that isn't really the direction we're going in terms of where we think we can make an impact here. Livestock and innovation, not only in our OA pain mAbs, but across our portfolio, really important. And as I look ahead, I think longer-acting formulations, both Solensia and Librela will be the direction that will help with this, even though as Kristin said, we're not seeing any significant impact in terms of our ability to grow the mAbs. I think initial visits where the vet has to see the pet and do the injection beyond that, the techs are able to do it, et cetera. And that varies a bit, but we don't see that as being a significant impact for us."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas."", 'Navann Ty Dietschi', ""I have 2 ones on Librela and one on Trio. The first one on Librela. With continued investments in 2024, what are the remaining SG&As in addition to the current testing campaign -- and just a clarification, do you currently expect Librela to become potentially gross margin accretive in 2025. And then on Trio, can you help us explain the switches from (inaudible) plus? Are they mostly from [BI's on like card] rather than from Simparica Trio and you see uptake from BI on younger dogs and puppies mostly."", 'Wetteny N. Joseph', ""I'll take the first one on Librela. Look, of course, we are going to be making investments, and we already started because as you heard in the prepared commentary, our penetration levels are running above our expectations, and we've launched DTC on Librela, and we're already doing the DTC across Europe and international markets as well. As we look ahead, we did make significant investments in our field force going back about 1.5 years or so ago. So we're able to leverage those investments, and we don't see incremental investments beyond those to drive our expectations and take advantage of demand on the product. The gross margin picture, as I mentioned earlier, it is dilutive if you look at 2023 and particularly because you saw us outperform expectations on Librela in 2023, right? As you go into 2024, Librela margins are actually accretive to the overall company margin leverage above. So 70%-ish gross margins for the company, Librela is above that, but it's below the gross margins that you would see in our innovative companion animal brands. As we get beyond 2024, you will start to see the -- at those innovative levels, which is above -- well above the company average. So hopefully, that helps clarify that point. Trio, as we've said, we've seen really strong performance in Trio, posting double-digit growth, Trio grew 17% in the U.S. in Q4 and we continue to gain patient share, which means, again, switching is low when you have a product that's safe effication has been in the market. for almost 4 years now. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing. I don't know if Kristin, you want to add."", 'Kristin C. Peck', ""The only add, we're doing quite well with puppies. U.S. specifically with regards to puppies. I mean puppies are on the Trio label. So I just want to emphasize that. I know it wasn't on the original Simparica. So I mean, really, if you're looking at new starts, we see a lot of puppies and we see a lot of conversion from single and dual agent customers to a triple combination and certainly a movement to more people from topical to oral. So there's lots of ways for us to continue to gain market share for that product, but we're doing quite well with puppies to answer that other part of your question."", 'Operator', ""And there seems to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks."", 'Kristin C. Peck', ""Great. Thank you all so much for the questions. And honestly, your continued interest in Zoetis. I want to underscore that the enduring strength of the human animal bond for pet owners expectations of human quality healthcare for pets and the need for safe and secure food supply all underscore that animal health industry is essential and very durable. We remain confident about our strategy and the ongoing value proposition because we know that our colleagues will make a difference every day in everything that we're doing. And with their support, I want to reiterate that we expect to grow faster than the market again in 2024, not just a line and to grow operational revenue by mid- to high single digits. We are firmly committed to investing in our innovative pipeline, our portfolio and the DTC programs we need to support the broadening and building billion-dollar franchises. The animal health industry is resilient even in times of uncertainty, and we are poised to navigate these challenges because our portfolio diversity, our commitment to exceptional customer experience, operational excellence and agility, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in future calls.

What do you think? As you see the stock reaction, do you think that the Street is getting it wrong here or what message would you want to give to investors?"", ""WETTENY JOSEPH: Look, Zoetis is the global leader in a very resilient and essential animal health industry that's proven to grow across different economic cycles. We're very pleased today, actually, with our top line growth for the quarter, which is 8% operational growth. That's the third straight quarter of 8% to 9% operational growth in a row, fueled by a companion animal portfolio, with innovative products across the world. So we're very pleased with that."", 'Now, when you get down to the bottom of our P&L, we did see some impact from foreign exchange, particularly in the hyperinflationary markets that have an outsized effect on our results-- bottom line results, as well as a non-recurring item, which was an impairment of a small acquisition in our precision animal health space.', 'But the fundamentals of our industry remain strong. And we exited 2023 with momentum and actually, issued guidance for 2024 today, that has 7% to 9% operational growth at the top line and 9 to 11 at the bottom, which means we are looking forward to expanding our margins and growing the bottom line faster than the top line.', ""And just to dig into the results that you guys posted today, digging into the segment. So livestock revenue beats companion animal revenue. Looks like it clocked in at 1.45 billion, so it did just miss the Street's estimates. And it kind of puts and takes there for that segment that maybe the Street wasn't aware of. And what's your outlook for that segment for the rest of 2024?"", ""WETTENY JOSEPH: Yeah, Josh, look, companion animal was 10% growth on the quarter, which is the third straight quarter, again, double digit growth in companion animal. As you know, our business, 2/3 companion animal and one third livestock. We're very pleased to see livestock grow this year at 6%. I'm actually here in Salt Lake City, Utah, where our sales team is having their national sales meeting for the year, very pleased and really seeing the momentum that we have coming out of 2023 going into '24."", ""But companion animal, third straight quarter of double digit growth. And our guide actually, implies that companion animal will continue to be the key driver of our growth in 2024 to deliver that 7% to 9%. So with livestock being a third of the business growing in the low single digits that's in line with the market, that leaves companion animal essentially, growing double digits as we go into 2024. So we couldn't be more pleased with that."", ""And it's really driven by our broad portfolio that we have lots, of diversity across the business, both in geography, as well as across species and therapeutic area, but also fueled by innovation. We have groundbreaking innovation like LIBRELA and SOLENSIA. These are all a pain franchise that just launched in the US in the fourth quarter. And we're very pleased with the results so far. And this is the next billion dollar franchise for us at Zoetis."", ""JULIE HYMAN: That's right. LIBRELA for osteoarthritis, for folks who aren't familiar. For people-- for the companion animal segment, where are you seeing the biggest demand here? I mean, you know, we love our pets, particularly here in the US, but obviously, of a big global business as well. So what's the most acute need for pet owners for their pets health?"", ""WETTENY JOSEPH: Pet owners actually see their pets as members of their family, and that human-animal bond is undeniable. 95% of pet owners consider their pets a member of their family, and so they're demanding higher quality pet health care for those pets, and they're willing to spend on. In fact, 95% of pet owners see them as members of their family. And if they were faced with a 20% decrease in their budget, they wouldn't reduce how much they spend on their pet health care."", ""So as we look at the space today, we see broad-based growth across the different therapeutic areas within companion animal. And we see significant opportunity to continue to really meet unmet needs in the space, be it across cardiology, whether it's renal. Chronic kidney disease is a particularly, difficult disease state for veterinarians to treat. And so we see those as areas that we see significant opportunity as we look ahead, that will be the next billion dollar markets that we will go after."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And Wetteny, one big theme for investors this earnings season has been China. So I'm interested to get your take. How is business there and what do you see in the quarters ahead?"", ""WETTENY JOSEPH: Yeah, look, China is under 5% of our business, of our revenues. And we've seen economic pressure in China, and we expect those to continue through at least the first half of 2024. However, long-term, we continue to believe in the potential for China. And over the last decade, our revenues in China have grown, significantly, and we expect that to be the case as we look on the long-term horizon."", 'But for now, the consumer sentiment in China, as well as some really difficult comps that we have coming back from last year will continue to put some pressure on the numbers for China.

With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full-year results, driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation, and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for our innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% in the U.S.', 'and 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species and therapeutic areas has sustained our performance further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential, and growing industry. Our track record of innovation from pioneering breakthroughs to product life cycle enhancements has solidified our position as the industry leader consistently growing above the market and enabled us to create market-leading franchises.', ""We don't just follow trends, we make markets. The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first two injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats and strengthening the human-animal bond. That's why today, Librela remains the No. 1 selling OA pain product in Europe."", ""At Investor Day last May and again at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion. And we are excited about Librela's performance since its U.S. launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth."", ""Similarly, Solensia has also been well received with strong clinic penetration around the world with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain maps. Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians. And after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. increasing pet owners' awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improve compliance and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs underpins our optimism."", 'We remain confident that we can sustain growth, thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticide portfolio and particularly Simparica Trio remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength, and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine.', ""As we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human-animal bond, and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance."", ""Our dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage, and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chain and commercial excellence to cultivate new markets, drive growth and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline, and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers while performing above the market."", 'Our focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In closing, we will continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis. As you look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world in humankind by advancing care for animal and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio, and defend our position amid competition.', 'I want to reiterate the four tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and you will return excess capital to shareholders.', 'While there is need and demand to improve the quality life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession, and purpose-driven colleagues. Thank you. Now let me hand it over to Wetteny.', 'Wetteny?', 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristen mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023 with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full-year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad with strong growth across both our U.S.', 'and international segments, with our companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and due to both price and volume. Full-year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal bodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.', 'On a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our International segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business and represented a 0.5 percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally.', 'Our lifestyle portfolio also had a strong year with operational growth of 6%. Performance in companion animals was led by OA pain maps, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the U.S. We continue to see penetration of our pain maps grow within vet clinics and a high level of satisfaction among both vets and pet owners.', 'Our key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 10% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international.', 'Our lifestyle portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both the reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in U.S. companion animals.', 'Adjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both the reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth assisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our in-line products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter.', 'On a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while international segment reported revenue of $982 million with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed with operational growth of 6%.', 'We saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our international segment, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain maps were the primary driver of growth posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 launch of Librela in the U.S.', 'Simparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as some increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S.', 'and international. Our lifestyle products ended the year on a strong note with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our U.S. and International segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from Draxxin and price decreases as well as by volume with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims.', 'Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal sales growing 10% and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by a full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier-than-normal pre price buy-in at the end of last year.', 'In the U.S., vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year. While we continue to see solid clinic revenue and revenue per visit growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our U.S. companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace its veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.', 'Moving on to product performance. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our pay maps, Simparica Trio, and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain maps posted $58 million in U.S.', 'sales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the U.S. early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in U.S.', ""sales in the quarter which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain maps, there's significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher-than-expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year as well as rapid patient share growth in the canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the U.S."", 'We have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the U.S., feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%.', 'Growth was driven primarily by price as we ran promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges and in advance of a than expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter with competition in the trip combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships, and a significant advantage of being first to market. Key dermatology products sales in the U.S.', 'were $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume with vets and pet owners referring this injectable method of administration. Simparica franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our U.S.', 'companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. U.S. livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotation back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix as well as share gains due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.', 'Moving on to our International segment, where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally and lifestyle grew 7% operational. China represented a 3% drag on our International segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain maps, our key dermatology products, and our small animal parasiticides portfolio.', 'Growth in our OA pain products was equally driven by full focus and DTC awareness campaign in early launch European markets as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million international with 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million of revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis.', 'We continue to see benefits to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets, and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong price season and demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness.', 'This growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our revolution franchise which generates a high proportion of sales in China, where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022 as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing onto international livestock, which grew 7% operationally driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio.', 'Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which was 10% operationally primarily due to higher competition-related expenses as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation.', 'R&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, Other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net dispute tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings.', 'Adjusted net income grew 6% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders.', 'For the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase. continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2024.', 'Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an incredible impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. On adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points.', 'with significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX. So these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January. For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and $9.225 billion, representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth with growth across both price and volume.', 'We expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the U.S. launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our pain maps both in the U.S. and internationally.', 'Our current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the U.S. are exceeding our expectations. And as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrants, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio.', ""For livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we enter 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with lifestyle industry growth. I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth."", 'For companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect U.S. visits to grow flat to 1% and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our pain products. For an animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio.', 'We expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination animal parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In other key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our three differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships, and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L.', 'Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower state utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix.', 'Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase in 2023, focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects as well as higher competition-related expenses. Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million.', 'This is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the nonrecurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023 as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market.', 'and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $5.84 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth.', 'To summarize, 2023 was another strong year. even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China. We again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future.', ""As we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Erin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So can you talk a little bit about the reorder rates and feedback and expectations around Librela for 2024 in the U.S. and some of those stocking dynamics that we should think about quarter to quarter.', 'And then a bigger picture question just on margins and profitability, and there are some moving factors in 2024, such as FX and the ramp-up of Librela that weigh on margins. But can you talk a little bit more about the potential margin leverage that you could see across your business as you expand in some of those faster-growing and higher-margin categories in 2025 and beyond? And if you could describe a little bit more about that longer-term margin leverage. Thanks.', 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Erin. I will take the first question on Librela and let Wetteny take that second question. Yeah. We were very pleased with how we did with Librela in this first full quarter of launch in Q4.', 'As you saw, we did about $44 million in the quarter $47 million for the year, including the early experience trial. And really how we achieved that was our penetration was ahead of schedule as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we -- given that penetration, which is in the high 60s, we actually began DTC ahead of what we were expecting. Reorder rates are coming in exactly where we expected in line with our expectations. So that makes us really confident as we go into the year.', ""we're looking at what -- your other question was what kind of stocking or inventory build we saw in the clicks. It's hard to give you a firm number. It's somewhere between a quarter and a third I would say, overall in stocking. But look, this is the No."", ""1 selling pain product in Europe, and we have no doubt it will be that in the U.S. as well. So we're quite pleased and certainly ahead of our plan on penetration. And look with our direct-to-consumer advertising investments we've already started late last year and into Q1 to drive growth in this product in the U.S."", ""So I'll let Wetteny take the second question?"", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, sure. Look, when looking at margins, yes, indeed, there are some moving factors when you think about 2024 and then beyond, we do have Librela in 2023, as we've said at Investor Day, if you look at our monoclonal antibodies at peak, particularly as we ramp up production in our capacity, which was built to make sure that we're confident in being able to take advantage of demand. They started being dilutive to the overall company average, for example, in 2023. As we go through 2024, Librela becomes accretive to our overall margins, but still below whether you would consider our innovative companion animal products."", ""And as we exit '24 into 2025 and beyond, it becomes more in line with our innovative companion animal products. So overall, beyond '24, I won't give you specific guidance here in terms of what to expect. But I think if you look at it, we continue to expect companion animal to outpace the growth of livestock. So that mix will continue to be favorable for us."", ""And as we get into the higher levels of production from monoclonal antibodies, they are also accretive to overall margins. And we're positioned to be able to leverage our SG&A base as well. So all of those should translate to margin expansion through the P&L over time. But as we've demonstrated, we're not afraid to make the right investments behind our products, behind our key franchises as we see them investments in R&D, as you saw in 2023."", ""And as the guide implies, R&D will continue to grow faster than revenue as well. So those investments will slightly offset some of those, but we're positioned to continue to expand."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead."", 'Mike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on margins maybe both for 2023 and 2024. So it looks like you're guiding back in the analogue math you're guiding to about 100 bps of margin expansion in 2024."", ""But you also did finish '23 lower than we would have expected. I think 4Q especially came in significantly lower. And you called out some headwinds during the call in terms of FX. You call out some timing, some contribution to the Zoetis Charitable Foundation."", ""Any way you could kind of back that out, give us sort of a cleaner number for what margins should have been in '23? And then maybe what some of those onetime headwinds would have as an impact to 2024. Just to give us a better sense of underlying margins and underlying EPS. And then my second question is just following up on Librela. I don't believe you actually quantified the target."", ""So I want to -- just given what you did in 4Q, a major focus point. is something like $200 million to $250 million for Librela for 2024 reasonable. And especially that's for U.S., but then on the OUS side, we've heard some concerns maybe coming out of the Europe and it seems like Librela has sort of been a little bit flat over the last couple of quarters in international markets. So any color on what's going on internationally? Thanks."", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yes, sure, Mike. Let me take this and then see what Kristin wants to add. So take a look at margins. Indeed, in 2024, we are guiding to about 100 basis points of expansion in margins.', ""Keep in mind, when you look at 2023 and how we ended, Q4 had about 100 basis points of margin impact and about 80 of that is from FX. So you're talking about roughly 20 basis points when you consider manufacturing costs and a little bit of mix. Now looking at mix, we had clearly really strong and quite frankly, a strong year in livestock. And we're actually here at the national sales meeting for our livestock with our lifestyle team in Utah, and look, they've had a great year, and we expect lifestyle continue to grow as we go into 2024, but clearly ended stronger at the end."", ""So that created a little bit of a mix. Yes, and as well as Librela outperforming our expectations exiting the year is also, as I said, a bit dilutive. So when you look at mix and manufacturing costs, you're still talking about 20 basis points of headwind exiting '23. Most of the impact here is coming from FX about 80 basis points."", ""The other items that we referenced in our prepared commentary with respect to impact on the quarter and how we ended FX is that has the impact on our on our finish here. If you take a look at FX, which is clearly nonoperational and you factor nonrecurring items like the impairment charge for the prior acquisition. Those two items are about $0.07 of headwind in the quarter in 2023 in the fourth quarter. So that's really the vast majority of what you saw impacting us here."", ""Of course, we don't forecast FX. So what we bake into our guidance for 2024 is essentially what would happen if we assume FX rates stay where they are. at the end of January here. And with that, on a constant basis, we would expect to expand margins in 2024."", ""And so that's really consistent with how we've approached our forecasting in the past, and I will sit here and guess what FX is going to do throughout the year 2024, and that will have an impact either favorable or unfavorable, depending on how that goes. For the other part of your question, I just want to maybe talk a little bit about Librela, how we expect Librela. Clearly, when you think about how we will deliver on 7% to 9% operational growth in revenue. Price is a pretty significant factor."", 'We continue to expect to be running price above our historic levels of 2 to 3 points. And perhaps slightly below what you saw in 2023 at 5%. And the Librela with the U.S. launch, clearly is going to be a significant factor.', ""Certainly, $44 million in the quarter and Q4 was, again, very pleased to see that. We do see about a quarter to a third of that being initial stocking. So you can model that out in terms of what that would translate to. We're still in the early stages of our launch, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far as we discussed already."", ""In international, we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing. If you look at international, the fourth quarter you still have about 47% growth if you look at the base markets where we were launched at the beginning of the year. And then the new markets are driving another bit of growth. You have another $12 million contribution from those new markets in addition to the U.S."", ""$44 million. So I think what we have to really take into account here is as we've been launching in markets. In Europe, there's some stocking that happens from quarter to quarter as we do those launches. If you factor those out, you just focus on those markets that we've already launched."", ""We're talking about 47% growth in the quarter, which has been consistent over the last few quarters about give or take. So we're going to be more pleased with what we're seeing in the international markets."", 'Mike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Great.', 'Operator', ""We'll move next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead."", 'Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', ""OK. Thanks guys. Good morning. Wendy, any revenue cadence in the year to call out? You've got sort of the easier 1Q '23 comp, but you were also noting more acute China headwinds in the first half."", ""So just -- how do we think about it? Do we sort of look at it on a two-year stack basis? And in the guidance for the full year, maybe GM, we're a little bit below what we were thinking. But SG&A expense despite the investments, Kristin, that you called out, the accelerated DTC, the SG&A was a little bit lower than where our heads were at. So maybe you can just talk through those items why we're only seeing seems like low to mid-single-digit SG&A growth year over year. I don't know if some of that's blunted by FX? And then just finally, I'm sorry, Librela, due to the stocking, do you still expect Librela to be up in the U.S."", ""4Q '23 to 1Q '24 as it absorbs the stocking? Thanks guys."", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Look, I'll take the cadence point first and then see what Kristin wants to add in terms of Librela expectations. Look, look, sitting here, I would expect a roughly balanced cadence across the year. Now let's take a look at Q1, which is a specific point you raised in your question, John. If you look in Q1, certainly if you look at companion animal in the U.S., this is an easier comp."", ""We had destocking in the first quarter last year. clearly something we look to see as an easier comp we come up against. But at the same time, you had a 12% growth quarter in livestock in Q1. And so I think if you look to balance complete the balance, but it's lifestyle growth both in the U.S."", ""as well as international. And then you have China, which clearly started to more deteriorate in terms of the economic conditions there throughout the year. So that becomes a heavier I would say, headwind coming into Q1 as well as the conditions -- weather conditions in Australia, etc., are having an impact there. So I think if you balance those out and last point I'll make is, Librela, we are clearly very pleased with how we exit Q4 and enter into but it's going to continue to contribute more and more as you go through the year."", ""So Q2 and Q3 would be more than Q1. Therefore, the contribution from Novella accelerates through the year and it doesn't have as much relative to speaking in Q1. So when you take all those into consideration, I actually see a roughly balanced year. Now we did make references to FX."", ""So from a reported basis, that, again, taking a look at where the FX rates were a couple of weeks ago, you do have a heavier impact in terms of both revenue and bottom line. When FX de facto, hopefully, what we provide in prepared commentary is helpful there. So that's the other piece you have to think about. But when I think about operational base growth, I mean, we did exit the year with the momentum as we exited Q4 and Q1, again, looking at U.S."", ""companion animal, but that's how I think about it. Now is Q1 is going to be higher than Q4 from a Librela perspective, I think if you factor about a quarter to a third of impact coming from stock in that $12 million to $15 million. So even if you had a flat that means you grow by $12 million to $15 million going into Q1. I won't call it exactly here."", ""Right now, what I would say is we're pleased with how the product is performing, but we are still in the early stages of this launch."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead."", 'Dave Westenberg -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So last year, we saw some discounting in front of the next gaurd combo launch. Do you anticipate there might be similar competitive dynamics in front of Elanco's Quattro launch? And how are you thinking about that in consideration with the gross margins? And then just a second one on just the DTC efforts on Librela."", ""I don't think there is DC allowed in Europe. But can you talk about maybe some of the learnings that you learned in Europe in terms of marketing and how they might apply specifically around communication of the vet obviously is the one that understands the superior safety profile with monoclonal antibodies and maybe how that messaging can come out? Thank you."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I'll start with that one and Wetteny can certainly build on it. I mean I want to first underscore, we had a very strong Q4 with Trio with 21% growth in the quarter with competition. For the year, overall Trio grew 9%."", ""So we're very pleased with that as we guided and Wetteny mentioned earlier, we're expecting mid- to high single-digit growth in Trio for the year. So this obviously underscores everything and we think we'll see that both in price and in volume. So we do anticipate, obviously, a competitor entering I'm not exactly sure what -- how Elanco's Quattro will do it. Our expectation is that is not a differentiated product."", ""They do mention taper, but you get tapeworm from fleas then we actually control fleas. So, therefore, that's really not a differentiated product. So we abused to having good competitors, obviously, with NexGard. I'm sure there'll be some heavy promotional."", ""But I think our strength, honestly, with our corporate accounts, the experience switching is low for people with this product. It's very unlikely someone entree is going to switch. We're doing quite well with retail and auto ship, which I think also protects us. And we expect a new competitor to expand the market."", ""What we're seeing a lot is a movement into the triple combos out of topicals, collars, etc. So as we look at that, we're confident in our Trio number as we look into the year. And with regards to your question on what have we learned from Librela in Europe, so we cannot do branded advertising for Librela in Europe, but we can do overall advertising for disease awareness and encouraging people who have pets both dogs and cats with osteoarthritis pain to bring them to the vet. And we are seeing real impact of that disease awareness."", ""I think it's been a long time where pet owners have not had a product that they could turn to encouraging them that there is a new product and then they should go to the vet and be seen. We are seeing really positive uplift from direct-to-consumer advertising even when it's not branded. So I don't know what you want to add into that?"", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Look, I think you covered it, Kristin. Trio been performing really well for us in the face of drug competition in the U.S. going to be more pleased. And to be gaining patient share in the face of competition.', ""I think that speaks a lot to what we've been talking about, which is the power of our relationships, the strength of our label and being first to market. So look, there'll be some initial heavy promotion that happens when a new competitor comes in with factor some of that into our thinking here. But until we see the label and see what they do, we won't hold in on specific reaction and so on, but we're very confident in our ability to grow continued growth franchise, and we're saying we're going to see mid- to single-digit growth across Trio in 2024 as well."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."", 'Nate Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Great. Good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the derm franchise. I think you had talked about mid- to high single-digit growth for the franchise overall.', ""I guess, specifically, are you assuming a headwind within that guidance from the competitive entry that's likely to occur against Apoquel this year? And can you talk about the strategies you're maybe putting in place to defend market share for that product? And then a quick follow-up on China. Could you maybe frame the type of headwind that you expect in China in 2024? And does that impact more on the companion or livestock side of the market? Thank you."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I'll take the derm question, and I think Wetteny can follow up on your China question. Look, we saw strong growth both in the quarter and overall in derm at 8%. And I just want to underscore that, that growth is obviously understated given the price -- if you're looking at the pre priced buy-in that we saw in late 2022."", ""As we look at our guidance for mid- to high single-digit growth for our derm franchise in 2024, that is the expectation that we will see a competitor launch. We expect this market to continue to expand and grow as we've talked about. There are 85 million dogs in the U.S. You have pruritus."", ""There is still over 6 million untreated dogs and 3.5 million who are treated but with steroids and sort of over-the-counter products. So we strongly believe this is a market we can continue to expand. Look, we've had two products been on the market, seven and 10 years, respectively. We've had millions of dogs on these products."", ""Our products have been proven over time to be safe and efficacious and they're trusted by pet owners. They're trusted by vest. And we're seeing more and more a switch to Cytopoint, build a preference for compliance by both the pet owner and the vet and our competition, we're expecting to come in a film-coated tablet. And if you look at that, we're really focused on investing in Apoquel chewable and moving them to chewable pet owners really prefer."", ""We've been successful in doing this in Europe. We're quite focused on doing this in the U.S. And we're also continuing to look at innovation in the short term on the long-acting. So we are going to defend this franchise."", ""We're confident in this franchise, our guidance of mid- to high single digits demonstrates that we believe we can continue to grow this market in the U.S. and around the world, not just defend our brand, but continue to bring life cycle innovation to the space over time to grow our share. Wetteny, do you want to take China?"", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, sure. And one point on derm of course, we have a mid- to high single-digit growth expectation that we laid out in our guidance. of course, across a broad range of expectation there, there's various scenarios around competitor entry, timing, pricing, etc., will play into that and the label that they have, of course, will be playing into how that plays out. But we're confident in our ability to grow."", ""Our franchise has been around for a decade in this space. On China, we've been consistent on this one. I think we continue to see sort of the broad economic situation there to remain where it is. We're not expecting to ignore nor improve at least through the first half of our year, and we also have stronger comps similar to the second half of 2023, little bit less so into the first half of '24, but still a headwind into the first half of '24."", ""You continue to see consumer confidence being low and swine prices are remaining fairly depressed in consumption there as well. So all those factors, of course, long term, we continue to expect China to be a strong growth market. It has done exceptionally well for us over the last decade. But in the near term, we're not expecting that to be a contribution to growth."", ""In fact, we'll see some declining comps in the first half on China."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead."", 'Balaji Prasad -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning everyone and thanks for the question. A couple. Firstly, I just wanted to understand the currency dynamics better, considering that most of the nearly 100 basis points return revenue and 150 basis points on EPS is to be going from here.', ""Why is FX severe and any particular currencies hurting you? I mean my general understanding is with $4 billion of -- $4-plus billion of export revenues and dollar weakening, I thought the impact would have been the other way around. Second question is around the FDA letter that Zoetis received on Librela number. I wanted to understand how frequent or normal are these kinds of letters on the animal health side and the issues that FDA found with Librela's as promotion with the inclusion of the P value on the secondary end points, and what is the current status now with regard to your communication with FDA."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure Balaji, so I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take it. I see you're referencing the letter back in November. Honestly, the letter is uneventful and was well addressed. We immediately resolved the request for clarification, would -- what you're talking about is a request for clarification on our promotional materials."", ""We just made a minor change to the promotional materials and how we represented some statistical data. The concerns are well addressed and the modifications were accepted by the FDA. I mean this isn't uncommon. So I don't -- that was easily resolved last year, that was a minor issue."", 'But Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?', 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, sure. On currency dynamics. And again, we don't forecast FX. So we tend to report out what we see the impact is."", ""And the dollar continues to strengthen against the number of currencies that we operate in. And there's a little bit of a disproportional effect that we see on some of the higher inflationary markets like Argentina, if you follow Argentina, there have been two really significant drops in terms of FX rates versus the dollar, if you follow back as we ended last year, both in December and I think back in August. And there's a little bit of a delayed effect on those clearly is impact on top line that we've talked about. But there's also a little bit of a delayed effect if you look at the impact it has on inventory and receivables that are on the books at the time."", ""So by the time you collect those, they have a greater impact, which is why you see the impact down to bottom line. So combinations volume. Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, those are more pronounced in their relative percentage of our revenues, given how significantly they value. That's what you're seeing play out."", 'But really across the board, if you look at how the dollar ended the year, it ended a bit stronger than you saw throughout the average of the year.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Please go ahead."", 'Brandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst', 'Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First, can you talk a little bit about the pre priced buying in the quarter. Are you able to quantify how much of a headwind that was? And then maybe talk about should we expect that to be a headwind going forward at all? Are you guys still working through that? And a follow-up to that, maybe higher level.', ""Is there anything in the pipeline or kind of in product cycle management that you guys can share with us, you're still spending a lot of money in R&D and even for next year, it looks like that may not be a specific area to get leverage off of the R&D line. So anything that you'd be able to share with us there would be helpful. Thank you."", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, sure. I'll take the first one and then Kristin will cover the second one. Look, there's always some level of pre priced buying in our -- as we exit the year given where what our price increases are going to be I would say, compared to the prior year where there was higher than average reprice buying as in 2022 into 2023, which had the impact on '24, we more actively managed customer orders in terms of reprice buying exiting 2023. And that gave us really First, the underlying market strength and momentum that we carried into but also, I would say, our quarter position walking into January 2024, we're certainly in a better position than, say, the prior year."", ""So we more actively manage those, but there's always some level in the numbers."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. And the question with regards to R&D. Obviously, we are very confident in our pipeline. I think we've been the most innovative company in animal health."", 'And if you look at the -- how we exceeded market growth every year for the last 11 years, it is due to the innovation in our pipeline. We are investing both for the short, medium and long term. In Animal Health, different than human health, that really makes a difference. You look at sort of what I call like life cycle enhancements that we just launched such as Apical Chewable, which will significantly support our key brands.', ""We're also looking at pretty disruptive innovations as well. As you look at sort of the short one- to three-year term of innovation, we're excited really for some of our long-acting. And we've talked a lot about investing in the medium to long term and really important new franchises as well, such as renal, chronic kidney disease spaces, looking at cardiology, looking at oncology and diabetes, there's really important spaces of unmet medical need in animal health that we're really excited to tackle. We're continuing to invest behind our diagnostics as well as behind our livestock business."", ""looking at new vaccines and immunomodulators in our genetics business. So we have a very diverse pipeline because we have a diverse portfolio. So we're continuing to invest behind that and remain very confident in that."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead."", 'Chris Schott -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. Just latest on vet visit growth.', ""I know it's not the primary driver of growth for your business, but you're targeting 0% to 1% this year. I'm just trying to get more color on what is the underlying kind of dynamics here. Is this mostly still that capacity? Is it macro dynamics? Just any color there would be appreciated. And then my second question was just coming back to Librela ex U.S."", ""From your perspective, how penetrated is the market for monoclonals at this point? And where do you see the largest opportunity for growth in these markets? I'm showing a sense of like we're in the second inning or the seventh inning of the ramp ex U.S. Thanks."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I mean, starting on the first, we are not very levered as we've spoken about many times before to that business. I mean obviously, they're not inconsequential our view of 0% to 1% is that's where it's historically been. That is historically what you see in vet clinic visits over time."", ""So I think we're really saying it's back to normal. What's really happening is there's strong end market demand. There remains some capacity issues in the U.S. But I think some of that's being addressed by more stuff going to auto ship and retail and online, which has also been supporting it."", ""But we really sort of view the year as you look into the year for although we saw flat vet visits, we spot revenue and revenue per visit up 7.5%. So we really are seeing really strong growth, obviously, overall in revenue, and we're much more correlated over time. with that, just given the strength of our portfolio, etc. And to your second question with regards to Librela outside the U.S., I think we're still early innings."", ""And really where I think we see the growth is right now, that product is primarily being used in severe dogs. I think getting it into more moderate dogs. I mean, I think, obviously, at least somewhere -- I mean in my 50s, I will say, my hip hurts right now. But everyone doesn't know that it's around me."", ""And so the reality is osteoarthritis exists in animals long before they're living and can't walk up the stairs. And the more we can control that pain early, I think, is critical. So I think what we're really trying to change the paradigm is getting Librela in first-line use for animals with osteoarthritis pain and getting it into more of those moderate dogs. And we think we more -- we can do that, the more we can continue to grow the market here and grow our franchise."", ""So we know, we believe we're in early innings across the globe with regards to osteoarthritis pain with both Librela and certainly with Solensia, where we still have to continue to grow awareness for osteoarthritis pain in cats."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Stephen Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead."", 'Unknown speaker', 'This is Chris on for Steve. We have two questions. First, on Librela. To what degree are U.S.', 'debt capacity constraints, the headwind to longer-term treatment compliance? And then is there a regulatory path for the approval of an at-home administrative formulation? Thank you.', 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Obviously, making sure that pet owners can get in monthly for their injections is critical. So that capacity is certainly something that we're quite focused on. But I think after the first visit, this is an injection that can certainly be done by a vet tech."", ""And I think the industry is really focused, and we've been partnering with corporates the ABM with lots of people to really think about how to change the paradigm of vets to vet techs and clinics and things like that. So we believe there are solutions to really address some of the vet capacity issues. So far, globally, and by the way, this vet capacity issue is not just a U.S. issue, it's global."", ""So far, it hasn't affected the growth of our key products. And your second question is with regard to home delivery. You want to take that one?"", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Look, I think the regulatory path to that isn't really the direction we're going in terms of where we think we can make an impact here. Livestock and innovation, not only in our OA pain maps, but across our portfolio, really important. And as I look ahead, I think longer-acting formulations, both Solensia and Librela will be the direction that will help with this, even though as Kristin said, we're not seeing any significant impact in terms of our ability to grow the maps."", ""I think initial visits where the vet has to see the pet and do the injection beyond that, the techs are able to do it, etc. And that varies a bit, but we don't see that as being a significant impact for us."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead."", 'Navann Ty -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions I have two ones on Librela and one on Trio. The first one on Librela.', ""With continued investments in 2024, what are the remaining SG&As in addition to the current testing campaign -- and just a clarification, do you currently expect Librela to become potentially gross margin accretive in 2025. And then on Trio, can you help us explain the switches from to Mexico plus? Are they mostly from BI's homes like large rather than from Simparica Trio and you see uptake from BI on younger dogs and puppies mostly. Thank you."", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I'll take the first one on Librela. Look, of course, we are going to be making investments, and we already started because as you heard in the prepared commentary, our penetration levels are running above our expectations, and we've launched DTC on Librela, and we're already doing the DTC across Europe and international markets as well. As we look ahead, we did make significant investments in our field force going back about year and a half or so ago. So we're able to leverage those investments, and we don't see incremental investments beyond those to drive our expectations and take advantage of demand on the product."", ""The gross margin picture, as I mentioned earlier, it is dilutive if you look at 2023 and particularly because you saw us outperform expectations on Librela in 2023, right? As you go into 2024, Librela margins are actually accretive to the overall company margin leverage above. So 70%-ish gross margins for the company, Librela is above that, but it's below the gross margins that you would see in our innovative companion animal brands. As we get beyond 2024, you will start to see at those innovative levels, which is above -- well above the company. average."", ""So hopefully, that helps clarify that point. Trio, as we've said, we've seen really strong performance in Trio, posting double-digit growth, grew 17% in the U.S. in and we continue to gain patient share, which means, again, switching is low when you have a product that's safe effication has been in the market. for almost four years now."", ""So we're very pleased with what we're seeing. I don't know if Kristin, you want to add."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""We're doing quite well of topics U.S. specifically with regards to puppies. I mean puppies are on the Trio label. So I just want to emphasize that."", ""I know it wasn't on the original Simparica. So I mean, really, if you're looking at new starts, we see a lot of puppies and we see a lot of conversion from single and dual agent customers to a triple combination and certainly a movement to more people from topical to oral. So there's lots of ways for us to continue to gain market share for that product, but we're doing quite well with puppies to answer that other part of your question."", 'Operator', ""There seem to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Great. Thank you all so much for the questions. And honestly, your continued interest in Zoetis. I want to undergo that the enduring strength of the human animal bond for pet owners expectations of human-quality healthcare for pets and the need for safe and secure food supply all underscore that animal health industry is essential and very durable.', ""We remain confident about our strategy and the ongoing value proposition because we know that our colleagues will make a difference every day in everything that we're doing.

Last year, the ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100—the QQQ—soared 54.8%. But there’s a dark side to all that potential upside: Tech stocks are notoriously volatile. The QQQ in 2022 fell a dizzying 32.6%, far more than the market as a whole. Which got us thinking—after a year in which tech was the story, what other stocks might have gotten overlooked? Below, we found five steady bets that each enjoyed double-digit returns over the past decade, which speaks to their staying power, a characteristic that Wall Street seers call “quality.” And they’re still poised to deliver tech-like returns, while rounding out a broader portfolio.', '10-year annualized\xa0price rise: 12.6%Market cap: $72 billion', 'The world’s largest derivatives exchange operator, CME Group, stands apart from the largely plodding share performance of its financial services peers. Its stock vaulted 31% last year, yet its price/earnings ratio, at 24, is still not much more expensive than the S&P\xa0500 (with a price/earnings ratio of 21), and far cheaper than the QQQ (32).', 'CME’s outperformance doesn’t surprise Max Wasserman, cofounder and senior portfolio manager at asset management firm Miramar Capital. Reason: It has great growth potential. “They are very profitable,” he says, “and they have more volume in the works.”', 'Indeed, derivatives keep expanding in scope, adding futures and options on all manner of assets, from commodities to currencies to stocks to interest rates, per the World Federation of Exchanges. In dollar terms, derivatives enjoy double-digit annual growth.', 'Globally, the derivatives market is about seven times the size of the equities market. The recent boost in interest rates actually helped CME, because that increases the need for interest rate hedges, via derivatives.', 'CME (originally named the Chicago Mercantile Exchange) has gobbled up rivals like the Chicago Board of Trade as it pushed beyond futures for crops and livestock. As Morningstar analyst Michael Miller writes, CME “has assembled a diverse set of derivative products … Weakness in one product is often offset by strength in another.”', '10-year annualized price rise: 11%Market cap: $155 billion', 'A temporary stumble on the track obscures the strength of Nike. It has had to work down bloated inventory, endure a sales slowdown in its important Chinese market, and beat back competition from upstarts like Hoka. The stock is off its 2021 high of $180, and took a new tumble starting in December after Nike tamped down sales expectations.', 'Still, the company, ranked as the world’s most valuable brand by consulting firm Brand Finance, hasn’t lost its cachet. Nike is embarking on $2\xa0billion in cost cuts over three years, as well as a plan to hike its use of technology and automation to streamline operations.', '“This is a turnaround story, and Nike has to take its medicine,” says Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. Nike is focusing on direct-to-consumer sales, hoping to increase this profitable channel from 45% up to 60% of revenue. Nike wants to return its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) margin, lately 13.2%, to the mid-teens, where it was in 2021. And there’s good reason to believe that Nike can, you guessed it, just do it.', '10-year annualized price rise: 19.4%Market cap: $533 billion', 'Visa introduced the world to the credit card in 1956—and has fended off competitors fiercely ever since. “A wide moat surrounds the business, and Visa’s position in the global electronic payment infrastructure is essentially unassailable,” writes Morningstar analyst Brett Horn. Small wonder that the stock has done well: Over 10 years, it beat the QQQ, and increased 26.2% in 2023. In snakebitten 2022, the stock lost just 3.4%. For the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30, Visa’s earnings jumped 15% and revenue was up 11%. In a shareholder-friendly move, during the past fiscal year, it bought back $12.4 billion in stock, and the board authorized more repurchases at double that amount. The company’s profit margin is a stunning 55%.', 'Visa has the most credit cards in circulation, with almost half the market, according to Bankrate. Mastercard comes in second at 36%, leaving Discover and American Express claiming small shares.', 'Visa’s asset-light business involves licensing its cards to banks. So it has relatively low debt, with a ratio to Ebitda of just 1.0. Return on capital over the past five years is a healthy 29%.', '10-year annualized price rise: 13.4%Market cap: $127 billion', 'For decades, electric utilities have been plodders, their stocks edging up in small, single-digit increments. They are typically the lowest performers among the 11 S&P 500 equity sectors.', 'That’s not the picture of NextEra Energy, which owns utilities—and is the largest renewable-power generator in the U.S. NextEra stock has regularly beaten the S&P\xa0500 index for the past 10 years. “NextEra has been a market darling, and the clear leader on clean energy,” observes Burns McKinney, a senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group.', 'By 2030, the world will need to quadruple its spending to upgrade aging electricity infrastructure and build new capacity, a McKinsey & Co. study finds.', 'Electricity-hungry data centers, EVs, and household heat pumps are all thirsty for power.\xa0 Enter NextEra, whose strong balance sheet and solid profitability are more than able to pay for the transformation to renewables. Dividends are healthy, sporting a 3% yield. Earnings per share have climbed at a rapid clip over the past few years, topping analysts’ forecasts. The company is divided into two parts: one an old-school cash cow making up 70% of the business called Florida Power & Light, the other the renewables unit. FPL has two nuclear power plants and a network of natural gas pipelines, and services a state with a swelling population. ', 'Operating throughout the U.S. and Canada, this non-carbon division is one of the world’s biggest producers of solar and wind power. For forward-looking energy investors, NextEra is well positioned.', '10-year annualized price rise: 17.7%Market cap: $76 billion', '“A housing boom is coming, and Sherwin-Williams will piggyback onto it,” predicts Freedom Capital’s Woods.', 'With rates likely coming down and a growing population, young adults who have been delaying homeownership may get a chance to jump in—and that’s great news for the world’s largest paint and coatings producer. Sherwin-Williams has 4,900 stores and adds nearly 100 new ones yearly, while its products also stock the shelves of big-box stores. More than three-fourths of Sherwin-Williams’s business occurs in North America, with much of its international exposure acquired through the 2016 purchase of Minneapolis-based Valspar.', 'Sherwin-Williams mainly caters to professional painters. “Its strategic focus on building this segment has created a strong value proposition for contractors,” writes Morningstar analyst Spencer Liberman in a research note. “Job site delivery, in-app ordering, and a capacity for high-volume orders save time for customers and allows for premium product pricing.”', 'Revenue and earnings have steadily risen. The stock, while on the pricey side with a P/E of 32, gained a market-beating 32.5% in 2023 and has the second-best 10-year price history of our five picks.', 'With stats like those, investors could be forgiven for overlooking tech stocks in favor of steady favorites this year.', 'This article appears in the February/March 2024 issue of Fortune.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

While tech stocks seemed to take the spotlight last year, it doesn’t necessarily indicate the downfall of dividend stocks, which have long held their allure. As we progress through 2024, the stock and bond market outlook fluctuates regularly, influenced by economic updates, statements from the Federal Reserve, and shifts in interest rate expectations. Initially, investors anticipated multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, with expectations of the first cut in March. However, following a series of positive economic indicators, the Fed has hinted that a rate cut in March is improbable. Consequently, investors are adjusting their valuations of stocks and bonds, awaiting fewer rate cuts to commence later than previously projected. During uncertain times, it's recommended for investors to focus on dividend stocks. These stocks typically offer good value and can provide consistent income, especially in sectors where there's potential for growth in stock prices."", ""Analysts' preference for dividend stocks isn't a recent trend; it's largely based on the historical performance of these stocks. Companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time have proven to be reliable investments, delivering strong returns in the past. These stocks have been particularly resilient during periods of high inflation. For instance, the S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index, which tracks companies in the S&P 500 known for consistent or increasing dividends and high forecast dividend yield growth, saw its dividends grow at an annual rate of 13.8% from 2010 to 2022, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices. This growth rate has surpassed the long-term U.S. inflation rate, even amidst recent spikes in inflation over the past few years. The report also noted that historical data comparing the performance of the S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index to the S&P 500 indicated that the index has displayed somewhat defensive traits, with a downside capture ratio of 94.5%. Additionally, over time, the index has typically captured 96% of the market's returns during upward market trends."", 'As previously mentioned, dividend stocks took a backseat during the tech surge in 2023, but reliable dividend-paying companies are poised for a strong resurgence. Analysts express optimism that investors will acknowledge the strength of these stocks this year.

If you want to skip our overview of autonomous driving and how it's one of the most important sectors today especially when we consider the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy Now. "", ""The biggest trend in the stock market these days is artificial intelligence. While data science has been an industry for years, artificial intelligence has come to the public's attention only because of OpenAI's massive success with ChatGPT. Before ChatGPT became available for public use, data science was primarily used in industrial cases such as supply chain management, drug and vaccine development, fraud detection, and others."", ""Another application that relies heavily on data science is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving is the technology that relies on a computer to aid a driver while they're on the road, and the industry has been able to progress quite a bit over the past couple of years. In fact, the same drivers of the A.I. wave, i.e. semiconductors designed and sold by firms such as NVIDIA Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), are also behind the rapid progress of autonomous driving systems."", 'These systems are made by public and private companies, and the former are traded on the stock markets as autonomous driving stocks. Autonomous driving stocks are those companies whose hardware or software is present in autonomous driving systems, or whose business operations are indispensable to the functioning of the autonomous driving industry. The potential of car makers to continuously gather data from every vehicle as it is being driven and then use this data to train algorithms that are capable of making driving decisions on their own has proven to be quite beneficial to autonomous driving stocks.', ""In fact, the world's most valuable car maker in terms of market capitalization, the Austin, Texas based electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) owes, some, if not most, of its market value to the simple fact that the firm's first principles driven approach led by its chief Elon Musk has enabled it to also operate as a technology company. This has made Tesla the world's most valuable autonomous driving stock, and the firm's massive market capitalization of $588 billion is based on its production systems and the massive amounts of data it has at its disposal to train its autonomous driving product, the Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) platform."", ""However, while Tesla's FSD continues to remain functional and operational despite the daily dose of controversy surrounding it, 2024 has also seen some other autonomous driving stocks struggle. One such autonomous driving stock is General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), whose Cruise autonomous driving system underwent a tragic accident in October last year that led California to pull its permits. Since then, a crucial GM update provided in January 2024 has created uncertainty about Cruise's future, and some quarters worry whether it will be able to regain compliance by the end of this year, especially after having laid off 25% of its workforce."", ""Since Tesla's FSD is in a world of its own, its rivals such as GM compete with each other. Another mega cap stock that is also an autonomous driving stock is none other than the consumer technology behemoth Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Now structured as a holding company that makes money from or funds the losses of a variety of lucrative business, one such Alphabet division is Waymo. When it comes to California, Waymoe and Cruise account for 99% of the test driving miles in 2023. And now, as Cruise's future becomes uncertain, Waymo has the 'road clear' when it comes to develop autonomous driving technologies."", ""As for Cruise, here is what General Motors had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:"", 'Our plan 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadence go-to-market strategy and we are developing new financial targets and a new roadmap. Spending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware, and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable, profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise EVs to the road soon. To summarize, we learned a lot in 2023, and those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholding value.', 'You’ll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV, and software plans, while meeting our financial targets. So our goals are truly aligned with yours. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches, and we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all four pillars of our strategy, ICE, EV, AV, and software. When we do get together, we will show you what we’ve done, not just tell you what we’re going to do.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best autonomous driving stocks to buy. Some top autonomous driving stocks are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)."", 'An auto warehouse filled with newly acquired used cars.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy, we ranked the top 20 autonomous driving stock holdings of the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2023.

The number of nights and experiences booked is expected to moderate compared with the fourth quarter, however, due to a particularly strong growth rate a year ago, the home-sharing company said Tuesday in a letter to shareholders.', 'Travel was especially strong last year after the Omicron wave of Covid-19 but the company is starting to see overall demand normalizing coming out of the pandemic, Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson told analysts on a call.', 'The shares were down 4% in premarket trading in New York Wednesday, after initially rising as much as 11% on the results. The stock has gained 30% in the past 12 months and hit its highest price in almost two years on Monday. The home-sharing platform also reported a surprise net loss in the quarter, due to a one-time tax charge related to a long-running dispute with the Italian authorities.', 'Still, Airbnb’s quarterly results beat analysts’ estimates on many metrics and Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky was optimistic about where the company is headed, especially in international markets.', '“There are massive opportunities in front of us,” Chesky said on the call. After spending the past few years adjusting to shifts in travel trends from the pandemic, the CEO said he’s ready now to “expand beyond our core business and reinvent Airbnb.” It will be a “gradual, multi-year journey,” and he pledged to share more towards the end of this year.', 'Chesky has hinted that the new ventures would include further integrations of artificial intelligence and third-party services into its products, which would allow more personalized travel recommendations for guests and better user experience for hosts.', 'The company had warned in November that it was seeing “greater volatility” globally early in the last quarter, due to economic and geopolitical issues. But then, bookings accelerated throughout the rest of the year. “Guest demand remains strong — especially among first-time bookers,” Airbnb said in the letter.', 'Airbnb’s results suggest there is still pent-up travel demand, especially in regions that were slower to return to normal life after Covid-era lockdowns. Airlines, hotels and and other travel companies, including Airbnb, saw record demand over the summer, a phenomenon dubbed “revenge travel,” as people proved willing to swallow high fares for flights and lodging to fulfill their lost pandemic itineraries.', 'Wall Street analysts were largely positive about Airbnb’s results, and saw broad based upside for the stock.', 'Revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 17% to $2.22 billion, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $2.16 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nights and experiences booked increased 12% to 98.8 million, also ahead of expectations for about 11% growth. Airbnb said the results were boosted by a “modest increase” in the average daily rate and a favorable foreign exchange rate.', 'Chesky sees markets outside the US one of Airbnb’s biggest growth opportunities and the San Francisco-based company is planning to boost its presence in about a dozen countries such as Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands in the coming years. Airbnb has been working to adapt its app to the local market and raise awareness to drive traffic and is starting to see the effort pay off.', 'Gross nights booked in Brazil nearly doubled compared with the same pre-pandemic period in 2019, the company said. The Asia Pacific region was one of the last globally to emerge from Covid lockdowns and cross-border travel is continuing to recover there. Nights and experiences booked increased 22% in the area from a year earlier and Latin America saw similar growth.', 'Airbnb said it’s “particularly excited for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympic Games.” It’s already seen an increase in supply and demand and the current backlog of nights in Paris during the summer is more than double a year ago. The company has said it expects to host half a million people in the City of Lights.', 'The company posted a net loss of $349 million in the fourth quarter, due to non-recurring tax withholding expenses and lodging tax reserves of about $1 billion as a result of a 2017 Italian tax law that it fought and later settled last December. Excluding that, adjusted net income was $489 million.', 'Airbnb, which went public in 2020, also announced a new share repurchase program to buy back as much as $6 billion of the company’s stock.', 'Airbnb’s results contrast with Expedia Group Inc., which owns the Vrbo vacation-rental site.

It's not a booking feature.

Experts often recommend prioritizing companies that demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payouts over time. Nevertheless, there is also notable interest among investors in companies offering high dividend yields. Over time, high-yielding stocks and companies with consistent dividend growth have demonstrated comparable performance, showing a close race in their investment returns. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series employs a distinctive methodology aimed at tracking the performance of 100 stocks with high dividend yields across various markets. These stocks are chosen based on their consistent history of dividend payments and strong fundamental metrics. Over the long term, this index has demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains compared to standard benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index achieved an annualized total return of 11.7%, surpassing its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which yielded 10.2% annually. Similarly, in the international market, the Dow Jones International Dividend 100 Index outperformed its benchmark, the S&P Global Ex-U.S. LargeMidCap, in both price return and total return over the past 15 years.', 'Heartland Advisors conducted an in-depth analysis utilizing data provided by Kenneth French, sourced from the US Stock Database Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. This dataset encompassed all equity securities listed on major US exchanges, including NYSE, Amex, NASDAQ, and NYSE Arca, spanning from 1928 through 2017. The study focused on examining monthly and annual value-weighted total returns of non-dividend-paying U.S. stocks and five portfolios consisting of dividend-paying stocks. These portfolios were constructed based on dividend yields. The research tracked the performance of each portfolio from January 1928 to December 2017, with dividends reinvested. Notably, the findings revealed that all portfolios comprising dividend-paying stocks outperformed the portfolio comprised solely of non-dividend-paying stocks over the entire period studied. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, in general, portfolios with higher dividend yields tended to outperform those with lower dividend yields. This suggests a positive correlation between dividend yield and investment performance, with higher-yielding quintiles demonstrating stronger returns compared to lower-yielding quintiles.', ""The impressive performance of high-yielding dividend stocks has garnered significant popularity among investors, leading many to turn to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a key source for such investment opportunities.

The outcomes of this strategy have been varied and inconsistent over time. According to data sourced from Barron's in one of our articles, over a 20-year period ending in 2023, the Dogs of the Dow strategy yielded an average annual return slightly above 8%, inclusive of dividends. This performance lags behind the S&P 500 by a little over 1% annually.

While tech stocks seemed to take the spotlight last year, it doesn’t necessarily indicate the downfall of dividend stocks, which have long held their allure. As we progress through 2024, the stock and bond market outlook fluctuates regularly, influenced by economic updates, statements from the Federal Reserve, and shifts in interest rate expectations. Initially, investors anticipated multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, with expectations of the first cut in March. However, following a series of positive economic indicators, the Fed has hinted that a rate cut in March is improbable. Consequently, investors are adjusting their valuations of stocks and bonds, awaiting fewer rate cuts to commence later than previously projected.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Although, when we looked at Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Medtronic:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.075 = US$6.0b ÷ (US$90b - US$9.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""So, Medtronic has an ROCE of 7.5%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.3%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Medtronic compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""Things have been pretty stable at Medtronic, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Medtronic to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Medtronic is paying out 52% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders."", ""In a nutshell, Medtronic has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 2.5% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."", ""On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Medtronic   you'll probably want to know about."", ""While Medtronic isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets."", 'Have feedback on this article?

IMARC Group anticipates substantial growth, projecting the market to reach $169.8 billion by 2032. This forecast indicates a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.1% during the period from 2024 to 2032. The robotics market's expansion is attributed to significant technological advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, a surge in demand for automation due to increasing labor shortages and rising labor costs, government initiatives and funding, and the expanding application areas of robotics."", 'The adoption of robotics has, in fact, doubled in the last six years, setting the stage for further acceleration. According to a 2022 report by the International Federation of Robotics, at least 3.5 million industrial robots were operational in manufacturing factories worldwide as of 2021, and industrial robot installations reached an all-time high. The investment in industrial robots has been on an upward trajectory since 2010, driven by manufacturers aiming to reduce production costs. Recent developments indicate that the impact of robotics is poised to extend beyond manufacturing into different industries. Notably, in the health sciences and wellness sector, robots are increasingly being deployed in operating rooms, clinical settings, and research laboratories to automate manual, repetitive, and high-volume tasks. With evolving technologies, robots are expected to operate more autonomously, eventually performing certain tasks entirely on their own.', 'The high capital expenditure and retraining costs associated with automation through robotics have historically limited efficiency gains to larger companies. However, this scenario is changing, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The average price of an industrial robot has decreased by half over the last decade, dropping from $47,000 in 2011 to approximately $23,000 in 2022. Forecasts by ARK Invest suggest a further 50% to 60% reduction in costs by 2025. Moreover, new business models, such as robotics-as-a-service, are enhancing accessibility by mitigating upfront capex costs through lease agreements.\xa0', 'The past five years, marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, have underscored the vulnerability of globalized supply chains, especially for businesses relying on intricate components like semiconductors. In response, a significant number of European (74%) and US (70%) businesses intend to reshore or nearshore their operations, as indicated by a 2022 survey by ABB Robotics. A substantial portion of these businesses (75% in Europe and 62% in the US) plan to invest in robotic automation within the next three years. Legislative acts like the US CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act further signify the trend toward reshoring manufacturing, either through incentives or mandates. Amid widely reported labor shortages, particularly in manufacturing, there is a clear opportunity for automation and robotics. China, aggressively pursuing robotics in the last decade, surpassed the US in technology adoption in 2021, illustrating the impact of this trend.', 'Bill Gates discussed some groundbreaking robotics initiatives in a GatesNotes blog post at the beginning of 2024. The Microsoft co-founder considers developing machines that mimic human body functions, such as walking, jumping, touching, and gripping objects, to be a greater challenge than advancing artificial intelligence, which already demonstrates daily progress. Gates highlighted his enthusiasm for five robotics startups, starting with Agility Robotics, an American startup that has developed a human-centric, multipurpose robot tailored for logistics work. This robot, approximately the size of a human, can handle heavy loads and express ""emotions"" through LEDs on its face, enhancing interaction with human colleagues. Another notable initiative is from Tevel, an Israeli startup deploying autonomous flying robots for continuous selective fruit picking, ensuring ripe apples are harvested around the clock. Gates also mentioned Apptronik, whose robots have the potential to assist astronauts on Moon or Mars missions. Gates also praised the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory (RoMeLa) at UCLA for its robot capable of navigating rocky, unstable terrain without falling. Lastly, he acknowledged Field AI, a company developing AI-powered software for robots, enabling complete autonomy in various missions. Gates envisions robots, including humanoid models, playing crucial roles in responding to future natural disasters or major health crises like the Covid-19 pandemic. They could manually weed on farms, carry heavy loads in factories, and become essential in healthcare, hospitality, and household settings.', 'To benefit from the growth potential in the robotics industry, some of the best stocks to invest in include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

I'm looking forward to engaging with the investment community as well over the course of the next several months to gain your perspective as well as many of you have read my most recent role as Stellantis were around the Company's North America operations and a key leader on the global executive team. And I will bring a perspective from an automotive OEM automotive supplier background and the understanding of needing to lead through industry cyclicality and a clear focus on manufacturing, purchasing, engineering and logistics in order for us to achieve our financials, what this means is that in addition to spending time meeting our customers, understanding our products and product placement, you can expect me to focus heavily on Goodyear's manufacturing operations and distribution, understanding that on every level and working with the team to enhance capability and our cost effectiveness as well. Our focus on clean sheeting and should-cost activities, our SKU or product complexity as well as our go-to-market strategies, like all other aspects of our business. That focus will be centered purely around our Goodyear forward in the coming months. I'm engaged in deep dives on each element of the program, the associated work stream, our amazing teams and committed to delivering the outcomes of the forward plan. I've been a part of leading transformational efforts and driving results in my past roles and bringing them to the bottom line through clear KPI.'s definition, the tracking and speed of execution for Goodyear for us, it's about maximizing our strength in our market position in North America is improving our cost structure as well as derisking our balance sheet. Ultimately, I am confident Goodyear forward will drive our Company's next stage of profitable growth and success is clear, and I fully support the plan with that by now, you read our investor letter from yesterday evening, Christina and I like to get right to your questions so with that, Nick, let's open the line."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Rod Lache, Wolfe Research.', 'Rod Lache', ""Please go Good morning, everybody up. Good to talk to you again, Mark, I understand, Mark, that you're just two weeks into it working at Goodyear, but I wanted to give you a little bit more of an opportunity to talk about what you see as most important to create a durable industrial turnaround? And what do you think the time line will be for you to kind of put your stamp on the plan?"", 'Mark Stewart', ""Yes, thanks. Thanks, Ron. Yes, I think what's clear is going back again to the very well thought out good your forward plan which was rolled out November 15th, right? And that is my focus is about streamlining the portfolio for us to get to sustainable operational margins of 10%, getting our net leverage to 2x, 2.5x by end of '25. And having that sustainable free cash flow, that's going to increase our overall financial flexibility. So specifically, you know, it won't be two weeks in a day here and right in the middle of this onboarding process. And again, I'm spending the majority of my time and plan to do so in the near term, listening to our team here at Goodyear, both at headquarters in the plants, our retailers, our customers, meaning in retail, OE and distribution. And it really is looking forward to meeting you guys as well, right in a different light from the vast right. I am deep diving into the operations going through the functions, the financials to really thoroughly understand the business right now. And so I'm asking lots of questions taking lots of notes continuously reviewing that, especially in this first 30, 60, 90 days to challenge what I think is coming in to get it to gain the understanding from our team also to get clarification of things that that maybe we can conclude into some quick win categories and areas that the learnings about half from the past as well. So again, it really is about trying to keep that fresh look with a hard drive to execution. And it is about speed of execution it's about us delivering that good. Your forward plan. A couple of observations that I had in the first couple of weeks. Again, there's incredible momentum in the good your forward plan meeting with the teams, just the as you look to the plans well, thought out step-by-step, timing, ownership execution. And so that is what I'm here to do is to help Christina and the rest of the team in terms of helping to lead and guide those initiatives across the finish line run."", 'Rod Lache', ""Great. Thanks for that. And, just on the business, maybe Cristina, you can help us with this cost performance is obviously starting to look a lot better now. And I presume that that's not really with much benefit from the good your forward plan yet. So, the question just looking at the numbers just continues to be market share. And I know there's factors that affected in every region, but see even in isolation, just good years year-over-year volume performance wasn't great. So, I'm hoping you can maybe just talk to us a little bit about you think that there is market stability for Goodyear or is that kind of a work in progress? And in other words, do you think that even beyond good, your forward more realignment is going to be needed from to the portfolio?"", 'Christina Zamarro', ""Yes, sure, Rod. I'll take it by region, and I'll start with the US and our fourth quarter replacement market share in the US in 2022 was here I have to characterize it right, is just abnormally high and it approached 28%. And that was all driven by your reference to the volatility in imports that we saw over the course of 2022, even at the tail end of 2021. When I look at our consumer replacement share in the US in the fourth quarter of 2023, I'd say it's in line with year-to-date results and reflects a more normalized level of sell-in share. And even with the significant change on a year-over-year basis, you're looking at the volume decline, where I'd also point out to you is that our sell out share. So what's getting bolted onto vehicles at retail was in line with the industry and so that gets to your question around a level of stabilization. So we would expect a much more normalized market share going forward in the US, certainly with margins in excess of 10% and we are in a good market position in terms of share. That doesn't mean that we won't make changes to the portfolio around the periphery. We said that we will do that as part of Goodyear forward through SKU consolidation through our customer programs as we look to continue to grow our margins. But I don't think there's anything that's significant there, right. I do feel that we've stabilized in the US compared to last year. Having said all that, we are the forward outlook for our mature markets, say, US and Europe. Rest of world growth for 2024, something like up 1% to 2% feels tougher in the first half than in the second half. And we know we also have recent declines in raw materials so that there's that to put into the calculus as well. Now when we think about Amir, the past headwind has been our sales volume performance really going back to 2019, we've been hurt by our position in OE, and that's where the industry is certainly falling pretty dramatically off its peak. It's also hurt in replacement where we do intend to be more profitable as you know, I think going forward, we see little downside risk until we are only forecast, yes, globally for 2024, something that feels a lot more forward or a lot more of them level, but we think about the consumer replacement market share in Europe. What I'd say is you've lost a lot of market share since 2019 to imported budget brands. And they have grown as a part of the industry, about 15 million units since 2019. And at the same time, the industry shrunk 7 million units. And so we've lost our fair share of that. And that's why we're directing the restructuring dollars as part of Goodyear forward to the factories in India, and that was all announced in the fourth quarter."", 'Rod Lache', 'So, just Christina, with that, once the restructuring is done in Europe, you would expect that business to be Morse defendable or more stable at that level?', 'Christina Zamarro', ""Yes. I mean, I would say on we will we're addressing the cost competitiveness with the couple of factories out. I think there will be more work for us to do beyond 2025. I think we can get Europe to a high single digit. And so our margin performance, I don't think we'll get there by the end of 2025, but we're beginning the work or laying the groundwork. We've announced the two factory closures. We've also announced a big SAG restructuring worth $100 million, and you will also get their fair share of the purchasing and some of the corporate initiatives that we're running as part of a good year for us. So, we do have a good path to earnings growth in the future. In Europe, banking is going to take a little bit longer than this two year plan period that we're talking about as part of your forward margin through."", 'Rod Lache', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'James Picariello, BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.', 'James Picariello', ""Good morning, everyone, and welcome aboard. Mark. Just on the restructuring the restructuring actions, the your forward savings plan. So you're calling for $350 million for the full year, $50 million in the first quarter. Just curious how we should be thinking about the remainder of the year in terms of the cadence and then more broadly, as we think about divestitures and the need for the execution there to fund the heavy lift on the good your forward plan in 2025 for us to achieve that $1 billion plus exit rate. Just what does all that need to take place this year for for the for the timing to a needs to be maintained here in terms of the time line."", 'Christina Zamarro', ""Thanks again. So early on fiscal year forward program, $350 million on a full year basis, $50 million in the first quarter. You can think about that is and yes, a big step-up in Q2 and then a little bit of a leveling on the rest of the year. But then what I would say is still ramping onto the fourth quarter. As you can imagine, we're building into a run rate through the end of 2025 with all of these programs where I look at the asset sales, I say the the processes related to the sales of the three respective assets that we talked about on November 15th is underway and progressing as planned. So we'll be back to you when we have significant developments and I'll note that the outlook items within the investor letter don't contemplate an asset sale. So we'll have to come back to you and adjust our box once we close on any sale. But I would say for the 2024 plan, no requirement for additional funding this year from an asset sale in order to achieve it depends."", 'James Picariello', 'And maybe this is a question we could have we could answer off-line, but but if just for context, if no divestiture takes place this year, right, just for context, what would be the additional what would be the additional restructuring? Could your forward savings that would be in store for next year', 'Christina Zamarro', 'When we laid out the plan in November, James, we had said $350 million in year one and $750 million in year two.', 'James Picariello', ""Right. But what about under the hypothetical that the divestitures don't take place this year again, purely hypothetical. Just what would be the the incremental push to next year without that additional funding source for the additional Does that make sense."", 'Christina Zamarro', ""So, as of today, we've announced a restructuring of about $750 million as compared to the guidance of $1.1 that was in our November announcement so we said $300 million of that sits in 2024, $350 in 2025. And that leaves the remaining stuff in 2026 it much appreciated."", 'James Picariello', ""And then if I could just ask one more just on the full year, kind of a follow-up to Brad's question on just on a full year basis, would you be surprised if Goodyear's unit volumes were down for the full year or you've got the minus 2% for the first quarter. Just wondering if we could kind of established that parameters in terms of just expectations flat or up or down for the full year in terms of units thinks?"", 'Christina Zamarro', ""Yes. I mean, maybe land, I'll take the opportunity to James to talk through a year over year as our yields and that will get you at least sort of how I'm thinking about volume, but I'll go through all the drivers of why does that make sense on a year-over-year basis, if you start with our 2023 as a way of $968 million, could you forward obviously Asset $350 million against base inflation of $215 million other costs. So these are costs in transportation and energy on a full year basis should be about flat. I do see right now a tailwind of $75 million in the first half is driven by transit transportation rates, but will flip to headwinds in the back half of the year driven by increased insurance premiums as well as some transitional manufacturing inefficiencies related to our announced footprint actions in EMEA. And then separately on wood to blow now at full production, we should get a $50 million benefit in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. Then raw materials, we've said our $375 million in the first half, first quarter price mix down $130 million, and then we'll lap that about $60 million drag that we've been carrying with us as part of the commercial truck decline since the second quarter of last year. We'll lap that in Q2. So our price mix in Q2 should be better than Q1. We're also looking to build a couple of million units of inventory in the Americas at levels are lower than what we need for optimal service level levels as a result of the tornado and are managing the business for cash last year that should benefit second half and absorbed by about $40 million. I know we've said working capital will be neither a source or use for 2024. So we do have some good year for and work streams that will help us offset that, particularly around procurement. And it comes down to and it was your question, James, what it comes down to is what you want to assume on volume price and mix for the rest of the year. I think if you look at Asia Pacific, we have been seeing steady growth of mid single to high single digit in our consumer replacement business. If you wanted to model that Q2 through Q4, I think that that would give you another $35 million or so on volume and on absorbed. And then you get to the mature markets where you have to balance this lower volume growth environment call it up 1% or so against the declining raw material environment and what you think that means for improvement."", 'James Picariello', 'Super helpful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Emanuel Rosner, Deutsche Bank', 'Emmanuel Rosner', ""Congratulations Mark. Good morning. And So Christiana, I appreciate all the good color around the walk. I frankly didn't have a chance to put it all into my little calculator. It sort of backing in real time. So just trying to understand medium term in terms of bottom line versus your view in November? I think when you presented the plan to all of us I think your high-level view at that point was look where exiting 2023 with a Q4 margin of 7%, which you know, clearly over-delivered on. So that's growth call it like that at the time you said $1.4 billion sort of like annualized. So I and then on top of that, we can have net cost savings of about $100 million. So, electrical savings minus the inflation. And so you're sort of suggesting that like one five, zero like some think that is potentially being a reasonable target. What does this year look like now that you have all the other puts and takes on inflation versus what you were describing a few months back."", 'Christina Zamarro', ""I'm sure you also tracking back to our November 15th announcement, you're right, we said that the run rate of the business and seeing the back half of the year felt like about $1.4. If I look at it today and adjusting for first quarter seasonality, we do have a big step down in Q1, always because, we generally sell about 4 million units less in Q1 than they do in Q4. We also drag in some inefficiencies from the holiday shutdowns into Q1. But what I would say, we have a lot of that we do have to absorb about $60 million. Oh, we are mines that aren't in the run rate. So on a run rate basis, I would start knowing knowing where we closed at the end of the fourth quarter, I would start a run rate at [1350]. And then we know that we have the positive of good year forward of [350]. We have a negative inflation of [135]. And then outside of inflation, I articulated on the year-over-year walk to $75 million headwind in the second half, driven by higher insurance premiums and then some of these manufacturing inefficiencies related to our recently announced factory shutdowns in India. So those that's new news. And then against that, again, that $60 million in OE. our minds that we're going to absorb that's weighted to the first half and even more weighted to Q1. And then that leaves your assumptions on how you want to build volume on top of that, Emmanuel. So hopefully that gives you that some clarity around the run rate."", 'Emmanuel Rosner', 'Sorry, the just to clarify the changes versus select the new news, I guess versus the home in the November framework is a little bit of a lower run rate, call it like $50 million as an exit rate. And then sort of like this a $75 million headwind in the second half. And then and your assumption on price mix volume, is that correct or evaluations and why IBM?', 'Christina Zamarro', ""Oh, yeah, unless we knew back in November. When I answered the question, it may or November, we said we have to come back in February and lay out our guidance for the full year until we our minds is certainly a piece of it. Insurance premiums are a headwind against the run rate. And then we have these transitional manufacturing costs as part of the recently announced closures in Europe. Okay. And then on the cash side, so the CapEx would go to grow and I guess quite a bit higher than it's been recently. I'm missing $1.2 to$1.3 billion that I don't remember it being sort of like a piece of the plan assets. Can you maybe just elaborate on why this is so related to And then conversely, I think the restructuring batch in the initial plan was going to be $600 million outlay in 2024 now $300 million. What does this relate to others incremental efficiency or timing of spend? And does that impact the timing of savings? Yes, sure. So I'll start on the CapEx question and our our guidance implies a $200 million increase at the midpoint to support new programs was given a range here. What I would say is and if you assume a weaker environment over the course of 2024, we'll find ourselves at the lower end of that range and at the higher end and more in a more constructive volume environment. And that's typically how we've managed our CapEx spend. Historically, the step-up is really driven by two different new programs in the Americas to drive mix up one, the factory modernization, what is the factory expansion modernizations going to convert about 9 million units from LVA to HVA, and that will be at an annualized run rate by the end of 2025. And then another I mentioned expansion that's going to add, call it $2.5 million of HVA capacity for us in a wise run rate by the end of 2026. So getting the full year benefit? Is that in 2027? The second question on restructuring on the guidance as part of the November 15th announcement was $1.1 billion. We didn't say that for you, what we've announced up until now is $750 million. And just based on the timing of the factory closures that we've outlined, $300 of that falls in 2024, $350 of that falls in 2025, the remainder in 2026. So it does feel like timing, Emmanuel versus maybe what you had written down to start."", 'Emmanuel Rosner', ""Okay. And you're talking about the spending here, the cadence we just gave."", 'Christina Zamarro', ""I'm sorry, maybe I didn't quite hear."", 'Emmanuel Rosner', 'You look at the $300, $350. And then the remainder of this is the timing of the spending.', 'Christina Zamarro', ""That's the timing of the $750 million of announced restructuring."", 'Emmanuel Rosner', 'Understood. Thank you.', 'Christina Zamarro', 'Sure.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And this will conclude our call Q&A session as well as our conference call. Thank you all for your participation and you may disconnect at any time.']"

You can skip our detailed analysis of high dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks in the Dow.\xa0', 'Dividend yield holds significant importance in dividend investing, serving as a key metric for investors. Experts often recommend prioritizing companies that demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payouts over time. Nevertheless, there is also notable interest among investors in companies offering high dividend yields. Over time, high-yielding stocks and companies with consistent dividend growth have demonstrated comparable performance, showing a close race in their investment returns. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series employs a distinctive methodology aimed at tracking the performance of 100 stocks with high dividend yields across various markets. These stocks are chosen based on their consistent history of dividend payments and strong fundamental metrics. Over the long term, this index has demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains compared to standard benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index achieved an annualized total return of 11.7%, surpassing its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which yielded 10.2% annually. Similarly, in the international market, the Dow Jones International Dividend 100 Index outperformed its benchmark, the S&P Global Ex-U.S. LargeMidCap, in both price return and total return over the past 15 years.', 'Heartland Advisors conducted an in-depth analysis utilizing data provided by Kenneth French, sourced from the US Stock Database Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. This dataset encompassed all equity securities listed on major US exchanges, including NYSE, Amex, NASDAQ, and NYSE Arca, spanning from 1928 through 2017. The study focused on examining monthly and annual value-weighted total returns of non-dividend-paying U.S. stocks and five portfolios consisting of dividend-paying stocks. These portfolios were constructed based on dividend yields. The research tracked the performance of each portfolio from January 1928 to December 2017, with dividends reinvested. Notably, the findings revealed that all portfolios comprising dividend-paying stocks outperformed the portfolio comprised solely of non-dividend-paying stocks over the entire period studied. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, in general, portfolios with higher dividend yields tended to outperform those with lower dividend yields. This suggests a positive correlation between dividend yield and investment performance, with higher-yielding quintiles demonstrating stronger returns compared to lower-yielding quintiles.', ""The impressive performance of high-yielding dividend stocks has garnered significant popularity among investors, leading many to turn to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a key source for such investment opportunities. Employing a strategy known as the 'Dogs of the Dow', investors focus on acquiring the highest-yielding stocks within the DJIA. The outcomes of this strategy have been varied and inconsistent over time. According to data sourced from Barron's in one of our articles, over a 20-year period ending in 2023, the Dogs of the Dow strategy yielded an average annual return slightly above 8%, inclusive of dividends. This performance lags behind the S&P 500 by a little over 1% annually.

IMARC Group anticipates substantial growth, projecting the market to reach $169.8 billion by 2032. This forecast indicates a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.1% during the period from 2024 to 2032. The robotics market's expansion is attributed to significant technological advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, a surge in demand for automation due to increasing labor shortages and rising labor costs, government initiatives and funding, and the expanding application areas of robotics."", 'The adoption of robotics has, in fact, doubled in the last six years, setting the stage for further acceleration. According to a 2022 report by the International Federation of Robotics, at least 3.5 million industrial robots were operational in manufacturing factories worldwide as of 2021, and industrial robot installations reached an all-time high. The investment in industrial robots has been on an upward trajectory since 2010, driven by manufacturers aiming to reduce production costs. Recent developments indicate that the impact of robotics is poised to extend beyond manufacturing into different industries. Notably, in the health sciences and wellness sector, robots are increasingly being deployed in operating rooms, clinical settings, and research laboratories to automate manual, repetitive, and high-volume tasks. With evolving technologies, robots are expected to operate more autonomously, eventually performing certain tasks entirely on their own.', 'The high capital expenditure and retraining costs associated with automation through robotics have historically limited efficiency gains to larger companies. However, this scenario is changing, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The average price of an industrial robot has decreased by half over the last decade, dropping from $47,000 in 2011 to approximately $23,000 in 2022. Forecasts by ARK Invest suggest a further 50% to 60% reduction in costs by 2025. Moreover, new business models, such as robotics-as-a-service, are enhancing accessibility by mitigating upfront capex costs through lease agreements.\xa0', 'The past five years, marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, have underscored the vulnerability of globalized supply chains, especially for businesses relying on intricate components like semiconductors. In response, a significant number of European (74%) and US (70%) businesses intend to reshore or nearshore their operations, as indicated by a 2022 survey by ABB Robotics. A substantial portion of these businesses (75% in Europe and 62% in the US) plan to invest in robotic automation within the next three years. Legislative acts like the US CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act further signify the trend toward reshoring manufacturing, either through incentives or mandates. Amid widely reported labor shortages, particularly in manufacturing, there is a clear opportunity for automation and robotics. China, aggressively pursuing robotics in the last decade, surpassed the US in technology adoption in 2021, illustrating the impact of this trend.', 'Bill Gates discussed some groundbreaking robotics initiatives in a GatesNotes blog post at the beginning of 2024. The Microsoft co-founder considers developing machines that mimic human body functions, such as walking, jumping, touching, and gripping objects, to be a greater challenge than advancing artificial intelligence, which already demonstrates daily progress. Gates highlighted his enthusiasm for five robotics startups, starting with Agility Robotics, an American startup that has developed a human-centric, multipurpose robot tailored for logistics work. This robot, approximately the size of a human, can handle heavy loads and express ""emotions"" through LEDs on its face, enhancing interaction with human colleagues. Another notable initiative is from Tevel, an Israeli startup deploying autonomous flying robots for continuous selective fruit picking, ensuring ripe apples are harvested around the clock. Gates also mentioned Apptronik, whose robots have the potential to assist astronauts on Moon or Mars missions. Gates also praised the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory (RoMeLa) at UCLA for its robot capable of navigating rocky, unstable terrain without falling. Lastly, he acknowledged Field AI, a company developing AI-powered software for robots, enabling complete autonomy in various missions. Gates envisions robots, including humanoid models, playing crucial roles in responding to future natural disasters or major health crises like the Covid-19 pandemic. They could manually weed on farms, carry heavy loads in factories, and become essential in healthcare, hospitality, and household settings.', 'To benefit from the growth potential in the robotics industry, some of the best stocks to invest in include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Plant', ""Thanks, PT, and welcome, everyone, to the 2023 year-end results call. If you move to Slide 4, please. And I'll start off by saying, Howmet's fourth quarter results were indeed very strong. Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share all met or exceeded the high end of guidance. More importantly, continue to outgrow each of our respective markets.Specifically, revenue was $1.73 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year and with commercial aerospace up 22%. EBITDA was $398 million, which was an increase of 18% year-on-year, while EBITDA margin was in line with Q3 at a solid 23%. Second half EBITDA margin was 30 basis points greater than the full year average and Q4 earnings per share increased by a significant 39%.For the full year, revenue was up 17%, driven by Commercial Aerospace, up 24% and EBITDA was up 18%. Earnings per share continued to improve annually and was a record $1.84 per share, which is an increase of 31% year-over-year.Moving to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Free cash flow was a record and above the high end of guidance at $682 million, and in the fourth quarter, Howmet continued with its balanced capital allocation strategy by buying back another $100 million of common stock and we're paying another $100 million of debt as part of its reduction of the 2024 bonds.Moreover, we refinanced $400 million of the 2024 bonds at a reduced interest rate. The combination of these actions further reduces annualized interest expense by $10 million going into 2024. This goes towards continued improvement in free cash flow yield and improved earnings per share. Lastly, net leverage improved to a record 2.1x, which was in line with expectations. Each segment contributed with engine products and forge wheels delivering record profits. We were pleased with the pickup in faster margins to adjust in excess of 22% EBITDA margin.Ken is going to detail all of this in his commentary. Having completed a strong 2023, the majority of my comments today will focus on the outlook for 2024 and will be covered in the guidance section after covering the historical results. We look forward to a healthy 2024.And now over to Ken."", 'Kenneth J. Giacobbe', ""Thank you, John. Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of the markets. All markets continue to be healthy, and we are well positioned for future growth. Revenue was up 14% in the fourth quarter and up 17% for the full year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued throughout 2023, with revenue up 22% in the fourth quarter and up 24% for the full year, driven by all 3 aerospace segments. Commercial Aerospace has grown for 11 consecutive quarters and stands at just over 50% of total revenue.Growth continues to be robust, supported by the demand for new, more fuel-efficient aircraft with reduced carbon emissions and increased spares demand. Defense Aerospace was flat for the fourth quarter. However, Defense Aerospace was up 10% for the full year, driven by legacy fighter programs and spares demand. Commercial Transportation was up 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 9% for the full year, driven by higher volumes.Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 21% in the fourth quarter, driven by oil and gas, up 34%, IGT up 24% and industrial up 9%. For the full year, the industrial and other markets were up 17% year-over-year, driven by oil and gas, up 38%, IGT up 16% and general industrial up 7%.In summary, another strong year across all of our end markets. Now let's move to Slide 6. Consistent with prior calls, we will start with the P&L and focus on enhanced profitability. For the full year, revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share all met or exceeded the high end of guidance. For the full year, revenue was $6.64 billion, up 17% year-over-year. EBITDA was $1.5 billion and outpaced revenue growth by being up 18% year-over-year, while absorbing the addition of approximately 1,850 net new hires.EBITDA margin for the year was strong at 22.7% with a fourth quarter exit rate of 23%. Adjusting for the year-over-year inflationary cost pass-through, the flow-through of incremental revenue to EBITDA was approximately 31% in the fourth quarter and approximately 26% for the full year. Earnings per share was a record $1.84, up 31% year-over-year.Additionally, Q4 earnings per share was a record at $0.53 per share versus the prior quarterly record of $0.46 per share. In the quarter, we had 2 minor benefits impacting earnings per share, $0.01 associated with the Q4 favorable tax rate and $0.01 related to favorable foreign currency. The fourth quarter represented the tenth consecutive quarter of growth in revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share.Now let's cover the balance sheet. The balance sheet has never been stronger. Free cash flow for the year was a record $682 million, which exceeded the high end of guidance. As we have done every year since separation, we continue to drive free cash flow conversion of net income to our long-term target of 90%. The year-end cash balance was a healthy $610 million with strong liquidity. For the full year, we reduced the 2024 debt tower by approximately $875 million, $475 million came from the balance sheet and $400 million was refinanced at a fixed rate with an approximate coupon of 3.9%.Net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 2.1x. All long-term debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of interest rate expense into the future. Howmet's improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were reflected in S&P's December rating upgrade to BBB-, with this upgrade, we are now rated as investment grade by 2 of the 3 rating agencies.Finally, moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. For the year, approximately $800 million of cash on hand was deployed to debt pay down, common stock repurchases and quarterly dividends. The previously mentioned debt reduction actions during the year lowers annualized interest expense by approximately $29 million. We also repurchased $250 million of common stock at an average price of $47.76 per share. This was the 11th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. Share buyback authority from the Board of Directors stands at approximately $700 million. The average diluted share count improved to a record low Q4 exit rate of 413 million shares.Finally, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, the quarterly common stock dividend was increased by 25% to $0.05 per share. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the fourth quarter. Engine Products continued its strong performance. Revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $852 million. Commercial aerospace was up 14% and defense aerospace was up 18%. Both markets realized higher build rates and spares growth. Oil and gas was up 25% and IGT was up 24% as demand continues to be strong. EBITDA increased 22% year-over-year to a record $233 million.EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points year-over-year to 27.3% while absorbing approximately 180 net new employees in the fourth quarter and approximately 1,030 net new employees for the full year. For the full year, EBITDA was $887 million and EBITDA margin was 27.2%, both were records for the engines products team, a significant accomplishment, 2023 EBITDA margin was up approximately 450 basis points from 2019 when revenue was at a similar level.Now let's move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems revenue increased 26% year-over-year to $360 million. Commercial aerospace was 45% higher, including the impact of the wide-body recover. Commercial Transportation was up 13%, general industrial was up 8% and defense aerospace was down 9%. Year-over-year EBITDA increased 38% to $80 million. EBITDA margin increased 180 basis points year-over-year to 22.2%. We are pleased with the continued performance of the fastening systems team with 3 consecutive quarters of revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin growth.Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $244 million. Commercial aerospace was up 19%, driven by build rates and the wide-body recovery. Russian titanium share gain was flat year-over-year at approximately $20 million due to timing of shipments. Defense Aerospace was down 35% year-over-year, driven by the F-35 and legacy fighter programs. EBITDA was $33 million, down slightly from prior year. EBITDA margin decreased 130 basis points year-over-year to 13.5% partially due to absorbing net new employees.However, sequentially, revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin increased for the second consecutive quarter. In Q4, sequential revenue increased 7% and EBITDA increased 10%. Although production efficiencies are not yet back to targeted levels, we are making progress and expect continued recovery in 2024.Now let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue increased 3% to $275 million. The $9 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by an 8% increase in volume, partially offset by lower aluminum prices. Sequentially, volumes were down 3% as we're starting to see signs of the commercial transportation market softening. EBITDA was flat year-over-year. EBITDA margin decreased 90 basis points, primarily due to the timing of inflationary cost pass-through.Finally, let's move to Slide 11 for more detail on debt actions. In the fourth quarter, we redeemed $500 million of our 2024 bonds. The $500 million redemption at par was funded with approximately $100 million of cash from the balance sheet and approximately $400 million draw from 2 term loan facilities. All term loans are prepayable without penalties or premiums and mature in November of 2026. $200 million was drawn from the U.S. dollar-denominated term loan facility and approximately $200 million was drawn from a Japanese yen denominated term loan facility. We entered into interest rate swaps to exchange the floating interest rates of the term loans into fixed interest rates.The weighted average fixed interest rate is approximately 3.9%, which is lower than the 2024 bonds coupon of 5.125%. The combined impact of these Q4 actions is expected to reduce annualized interest expense by approximately $10 million. Moreover, debt reductions in Q1 through Q3 reduced annualized interest expense by an additional $19 million. We continue to leverage the strength of our balance sheet. Since 2020, we've paid down gross debt by approximately $2.2 billion with cash on hand and lowered our annualized interest cost by more than $130 million.Gross debt now stands at approximately $3.7 billion. All long-term debt continues to be unsecured and at fixed rates and our $1 billion revolver remains undrawn. Lastly, before turning it back to John, let me highlight a couple of additional items. As we continue to focus on improving Howmet's performance and capital allocation, I wanted to highlight our pretax RONA, or return on net assets metric, RONA, which excludes goodwill and special items, has improved by approximately 400 basis points on a year-over-year basis from 29% in 2022 to 33% in 2023.You will find reconciliations in the appendix of the presentation. Lastly, in the appendix on Slide 16, we have included 2024 assumptions. Interest expense is expected to improve to approximately $200 million. The guidance includes all debt actions completed to date. The operational tax rate is expected to continue to improve to a range of 21% to 22%. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately a 600 basis point improvement in the operational tax rate since separation in 2020. We continue to be focused on further improvements in our operational tax rate. Pension and OPEB expense as well as contributions are expected to increase modestly by approximately $15 million year-over-year.Finally, we expect miscellaneous other expenses, which are below the line to be in the range of $5 million of income to $15 million of expense for the year, but are very volatile within quarters.So with that, let me turn it back to John."", 'John C. Plant', ""Thanks, Ken, and let's move to Slide 12, please. The commercial aerospace market continues to be strong. Airline load factors are good. International travel continues to strengthen and all this has led to significant orders for new aircraft and higher levels of aircraft backlog at both Airbus and Boeing. Demand for new aircraft is expected to be sustained due to the need for aircraft with substantially improved fuel efficiency and also to the commitments made by airlines of improvement towards carbon neutrality with 2 stages of 2030 and then 2050.Commercial aerospace players are also growing not only due to the number of aircraft in service, but also in the case of narrowbody due to the increased service shop visit requirements of the newer fuel-efficient engines. This is a long-term trend over the next decade and one which we look forward to. Defense budgets and hence the defense market continues to be strong in fighter aircraft, bombers, drones and helicopters. Tank turbines and howitzer systems are also strong. Specifically, we expect increased F-35 engine spare requirements due to the shop visit requirements as the fleet continues to expand globally.Other markets of oil and gas and gas turbines continue to be healthy. We do see natural gas turbines to be the natural accompanying technology to the renewal segment of wind and solar. The market where we're cautious is that of commercial transportation, where we see potential for up to a 10% reduction in revenue as we move through 2024. We do envisage commercial transportation to resume growth in 2025 and into 2026. This is supported by the view that any potential reduction is mild due in part to the continued secular growth of our improved penetration of aluminum wheels compared to steel wheels for the needs of fuel efficiency or increased payloads. Also as truck engines move to alternate means of propulsion other than fossil fuels, the adoption of aluminum wheels should gradually move towards 100%.Moving now from general market commentary to specific numbers. We expect Q1 revenue to be up 9% year-over-year and EBITDA up approximately 11%. For Q1 of 2024, we expect revenues of $1.74 billion, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA of $400 million, plus or minus $5 million and earnings per share of $0.51, plus or minus $0.1. This is similar to Q4 after excluding the one-off benefits of the tax rate and below the line items, which contributed about $0.02.Regarding the full year 2024, we see revenue at $7.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million, EBITDA of $1.635 billion, plus or minus $35 million and earnings per share of $2.15 plus or minus $0.05. Free cash flow, we see a $735 million, plus or minus $35 million and CapEx of $290 million, plus or minus $15 million.I'd like to comment further on the capital expenditures, seen as these are expected to be above depreciation for the first time in many years. Essentially, this is due to investment opportunities materializing the engine products business. We see this as a very good sign to be able to deploy capital with high returns and rapid future growth.In fact, let me expand, in 2023, which was another year of above-market growth in each of our segments, in fact, above 5% above market served. This engineering investment is viewed as excellent and speaks to the continued market growth in the business with 27% plus EBITDA margins and a 33% plus return of capital. And this continued growth is seen as the investments come on stream in approximately 18 months' time.Underpinning all of this is an agreement with one of our engine manufacturer customers for increased business and increased market shares. This does not change our long-term commitment to deliver average free cash flow conversion of 90% of net income. And as you can see from our guide, free cash flow after all cost is approximately 45% of EBITDA which is best-in-class.We based our guidance on Boeing 737 MAX production of 34 aircraft per month and 6 787 aircraft per month. Our Airbus assumptions are in line with their plans. As an example, Airbus A320s are at 56 aircraft per month. We are prepared and can be prepared should volumes increase above current customer assumptions. In the case of the A320 we're anticipating the build rate increasing in 2025 to approximately 60 to 65 aircraft a month and that will require us to do some prebuilds or parts in 2024, and that explains the average we've given.Please now move to Slide 13. 2023 was another good year for Howmet. Sales increased by 17% and were above each of our segments and markets. EBITDA was up 18% and EBITDA margin increased to 23% in the second half of the year. Earnings per share was up 31%. Cash flow exceeded guidance and was in line with our long-term view of converting 9% of net income into cash flow.The balance sheet was strengthened with significant debt paydown repurchases with cash on hand and record low net leverage of 2.1x. The outlook for next year, for 2024 has already been outlined in the numbers given. But let me give you some qualitative terms to look at 2024 as it demonstrates the following features.We have further revenue growth, which we expect will be proven to be again in excess of our end markets served. Free cash flow continues to improve with the higher EBITDA margins and we expect further reduced debt and interest expense burden, and we take into 2024 a reduced share count. And you can expect further shareholder-friendly actions of increased share buybacks and further dividend growth.And now I'll close my prepared remarks. I now hand over for questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein."", 'Douglas Stuart Harned', ""You're looking at a situation with very high demand on the engine product side. And one thing I'm really interested is how you're seeing pricing. Given your very strong position there, you're looking at catalog spares prices from the engine OEMs up in the teens recently, what do you see for Howmet in terms of pricing over the next couple of years? And can you explain the differences there between what you're getting and what you're seeing as increases on the engine OEM side?"", 'John C. Plant', ""Yes. We've noted that our engine customers have been raising prices into the MRO shops significantly. We don't have that opportunity, Doug, in the short term. In that our long-term agreements provide for price stability during the duration of those agreements. However, when we get to the long-term agreement renewal, with the sophistication of the analysis we introduced a few years ago, we now split all of the parts into volume and variety and looking at the different trends within that and also when parts go to, let's call it, past model and become service only, but also noting the increased service demand for even current parts. And so at that time, we do differentiate between the increased pricing that we expect to receive at the LTA renewal and certainly look at the service requirements and the pricing and you can expect that as we renew those agreements, and I don't generally comment about when those agreements are renewed, but you can expect to see increased pricing associated with the service parts."", 'Douglas Stuart Harned', 'But from your standpoint, when you look at save in the short term 2024. So how do you think of your pricing relative to inflation? And is this a positive contributor to margins?', 'John C. Plant', ""No, I don't think you can say that we're going to price per se on an individual service part. But what you can expect is that we will be moving on price once again in 2024. And you'll see when we issue our 10-K, which I believe is this evening, you'll see that trend continued in Q4. So I expect to see continued positive contributions from pricing as we go forward. And you'll see that '23 was a healthy year and '24 should be an equally healthy year."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.', 'Robert Alan Stallard', 'On your Boeing 737 rate assumption, are you currently shipping at 34 a month to the 737 line. And if Boeing should actually get to 38 do you have the head count in place to sustain that?', 'John C. Plant', ""Okay. So we received demand signals from 2 principal sources. One is from, of course, the aircraft manufacturers for our structural products and then on a different sequencing, the demand signals from the engine manufacturers. If you look at 2023, we saw Boeing schedules increase to rate 38. And so we were in a position and we're able to support them in that rate 38. We were cautious when they were talking about going up to 42, which as you saw was delayed and now that's not going to be the case.Our thoughts around 2024 is that this is going to continue to be choppy as the back class is not necessarily the stop start, stop start that we've experienced in quite the same degree as the last couple of years. But we're also prepared that maybe Boeing will not be building at rate 38 because indeed, we don't believe that they have built at that rate, and we've seen various assumptions of what was actually built in Q4 and now we see they are restricted to -- by the FIA in terms of their build in 2024. What, of course, we don't know is to what degree of any underbuild in one month will be that to overbuild in another month or indeed, is it just going to be capped at the production for that month in terms of issuance of airworthiness certificates. We have no idea. And therefore, we're still thinking that demand could be choppy and indeed, given the balance sheet of Boeing, is that are they willing to continue to sustain building out at a higher rate than they're actually building.And therefore, we've made some allowance within our working capital such that if they don't take the parts our schedule is that, that's provided for in the free cash flow guidance that we've given you. And similarly, I mean, I'll get it all out there is that we saw our margin flow-through for 2024 at 28%, plus or minus compared to our Q4 of 31%. And this also allowed to provide some allowance for the chop or choppiness that we may see, depending upon how things go with Boeing."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird.', 'Peter J. Arment', ""John, you added, I think, roughly about 1,700 employees in 2023, if I have that correct. I was just wondering what your guidance kind of assumes around head count growth expectations in '24. And yes, maybe I'll just leave it there."", 'John C. Plant', ""We were expecting between 1,000, 1,500 people, depending upon what the exit rate should finally be for the year. So we are continuing to recruit albeit from those numbers, you can see that we're ingesting the labor at a reduced net rate to the last year over the last 18 months. And some of that's to do with the bringing now the experience of some of those operators who've been able to retain during that recruitment process and also the improvement in productivity that again, we are planning to make. And so it's a blend of all of those things, plus some of the automation that we've talked about in the past coming on stream.So let's call it 500 people plus or minus less than we took on last year and while at the same time, trying to improve our recruitment and retention statistics, which is really very important to us to gain that further stability of labor."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""Hoping to focus on Fastening Systems, if you could, John. The growth there obviously was pretty much on top of the engine products growth. Is there a leader in '24? Is it fastening systems? And then maybe just could you provide any color as it relates to where distribution sits with Fastening and where your wide-body recovery is versus pre-COVID?"", 'John C. Plant', ""Yes. And one of the things that I've been particularly pleased with has been the improvements in our distribution business inside Fastening Systems. A couple of years ago, maybe 3 years ago now, we created a separate business within, its rolled, its amalgamated with our OE business. We provided dedicated management to that distribution business. And we've seen it indeed have outsized growth relative to the market, and that continued again in a significant way in 2023.So that's proven to be very good for us. In terms of like where does the final say, score card land for 2024 in terms of relative growth of engine versus fasteners, it's difficult to say at the moment, I expect very positive contributions from both. We have to recognize is that we still have to see wide-body demand come back and really be built and with rapacity actually to grow higher because that wide-body demand mix should actually show improvements because the relative growth compared to narrow body, especially given that Boeing is now capped is that, that should be good.At the same time, we note for -- for example, take the LEAP range of engines is that the, I'll say, growth of that segment has been reduced a little bit, both in the actual for 2023 and slightly lower build as the initial demands have dropped from, I'll say, a year ago, we saw at 24' was going to be looking at 2,200 engines they went to that 2,000 and I know it's in the range of, I think, something like 1,875 to 1,950, something like that.So we've got to see how all that settles out and indeed, it's the parlance of what goes to OE build versus service demand for those engines. So I mean the most important thing is both engines and fasteners are good. So I don't want to handicap you at this point, but it will be -- I expect that we'll be having a good year for both."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""I wanted to ask about margins. John, maybe you could talk about 2024 margins, just looking at Q1 and the full year, you're kind of pointing to 23%. And I guess I'm a little surprised that there's no really an improvement from your Q4 exit rate and you're still sub-30% on the incrementals. So maybe if you could just shape that out for us, how you think about that with aero volumes getting better and maybe wheels troughing and also, you mentioned something in the -- in regards to engine pricing and how you're locked into long-term contracts and as well as the F-35, obviously, that's a long-term contract, too. So how do you think about what percentage of your margins are locked in because of LTA?"", 'John C. Plant', ""I mean LTA certainly govern the most of our business for the company. And I guess momentarily the number of how much is governed escapes me, but it's -- I'm going to say somewhere up at that. So I'll say, 75% to 85%, I believe, but can refine that should you need to, as I carry on talking here. Having said that, of course, there are certain agreements which have come up for renewal for 2024 pricing. And indeed, we are probably now 90% agreed for the price structures for 2024. And so our expectation for the price commentary I've already given you is that you'll see that Q4 was healthy or mutual with 10-K, a very solid year, and we expect 2024 to be similar. And within that, you will see some of our engine products to indeed be repriced during 2024 and have already been agreed.So that's also the good. In terms of margins, I mean you never get like quarter-on-quarter straight line, you tend to plateau for a little while and then you move again. And our thought really has been that we stepped up to a 23% level in the second half of '23. And so what should we expect? And -- and I think you're saying, well, let's play it again for Q1 and see how we go is the right assumption. I've already told you that we have assumed a 28% incremental versus what we converted at 31% in Q4.And this also provides some allowance for the choppiness that have come. So should for example, Boeing not take all the parts that they've scheduled out and those have to go into inventory. Therefore, we won't be taking the profit on them. And so we've assumed that, I'd say, a 3% lower absolute number of conversion. And therefore, to me, just playing it out seems a very reasonable assumption for the near term. How it flows for the balance of the year, it's difficult to say at this point in time.In terms of up-to-date market commentary, we actually see wheels demand to be probably a little bit stronger than we had imagined in the short term, and that's within the numbers we've already given you. At the same time, what does the back end of the year behold? I don't really know at this point. Orders have been, intakes for truck manufacturers have been a little bit stronger. And therefore, it bodes well, but of course, those are cancelable depending upon how the general economy goes and we'll have to wait and see. For me, the most important thing, it's not like what happens this quarter or next. But indeed, that market of commercial transportation, we expect to resume growth in '25 and '26 and then that continued with, I think, strong continued demand from commercial aerospace and then continuing to defense and for the gas turbine business promises good growth beyond '24 as we go into '25 and '26."", 'Kenneth J. Giacobbe', 'And Sheila, this is Ken. Just to build on your question around long-term agreements. John is right, somewhere in the 75% of the revenue is tied to long-term agreements. That could be plus or minus, say, 5% depending on where we are in the renewal process. As you can imagine, on the aerospace side, much heavier on long-term agreements. So on the engine side of the house, you could be up to 90% of that revenue could be under long-term agreements.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.', 'Noah Poponak', ""John, just one clarification on the original equipment side of aerospace. I couldn't quite decipher where you're saying you are now on the MAX rate, if it's possible to quantify that? And then on the aftermarket side, can you baseline us on what percentage of aerospace is aftermarket at this point? And just how much growth can we expect there in the medium term given the work you're doing related to time on wing, on the engine, and elsewhere that's incremental?"", 'John C. Plant', ""Yes. So our assumption in terms of our guide, of course, our guide is quite independent of what Boeing or indeed Airbus may build and what they may schedule, it's our financial assumption and one that I feel appropriate for Howmet and for the large part, I feel is that we've tended to call the market fairly reasonably in the last few years.So our assumption very clear was at 34% for the average for Boeing 737 for the year. Now what they actually build, I don't know and what they actually schedule at, I'm going to say at the moment, they say they're going to continue with their rate 38 assumption as best as we can detect from what we see from our demand schedules.So that's those specific numbers. In terms of spares, our exit rate for spares in the commercial aviation market, stepped up again. And so compared to 2019, which is the reference point we've used previously, and if you remember, in 2019, our revenue from the spares market for -- on the commercial side is about $400 million, and it was about $400 million on the defense and gas turbine side.On the gas turbine and defense side, that continued to be steady and increasing and now that increased to a level, we believe we'll see something like $600 million of demand in the defense sector and IGT sector. We're both growing, but indeed, the spares for the F-35 growing in particular. And in 2025, as an example, we expect the spares business for F-35 to be as big as the OE business has been in recent years. So that's been good.We've seen demand increase in '23, we're expecting it in '24 and then 25' we should expect it to be a segment, continue to grow as that fleet continues to expand. And the fleet, I think, is about 975 aircraft. And while we originally thought it's going to expand like the 150 a year, as you know, currently Lockheed is not building or not building nor delivering at that rate. And so to some degree, you have to be a little bit cautious. But you can expect a 50% increase compared to 2019 levels.In the case of the commercial segment, that did drop at the depths of COVID to half, so something just sub $200 million. And now that's fully grown back to $400 million, but with the run rate -- you see in the third and fourth quarters and then strengthening each quarter is that, that is now at a run rate above $400 million.And then obviously, to that, you also have to bake in the potential for additional schedules as these reported time on wing issues get, I'll say, addressed and serviced. And we do expect demand to be picking up in the second half of 2024 and then further strong demand and a very strong demand going in '25 and '26.So that we see is very good. And so today, you can assume that our spares business for '23 is getting about, let's say, the $1 billion mark, and we expect it to be -- that is, therefore, an increased percentage of our revenues and you could expect the percentage, therefore, going into the aftermarket to continue to increase as we go into '25 and '26 after a healthy year in '24.So overall, a good picture and indeed, as I said in my commentary, that the thing which is -- it's not demand just to solve the immediacy of a time on wing issue. I mean there is a structural shift in spares demand, which I don't think it's appreciated yet totally in that the newer engines themselves essentially have increased service intervals because as you increase the temperature pressure in engine, the wearing part, so think the high-pressure turbine part of the engine.So those initial Blade 1, Blade 2, Vane 1 et cetera, those become -- those are wearable or wearing parts, a bit like brake pads on a car. And so you can expect to see a structural shift as increased fitment of those engines is in the fleet and it replaces the previous CFM56 engine.So you're seeing temporary strong demand for CFM56 just to running the fleet, existing fleet harder and a fundamental structural increase in replacement costs which is going to be there. And I think you're going to see additional, say, service shops built around the work to service these new engines, but that's seen that will unfold over the next, say, few years."", 'Noah Poponak', ""Okay. That's really interesting. I appreciate all that detail. Just to make sure I have the MAX assumption correct, are you delivering to about 34 right now and you assume you stay there through the year? are you in the low 30s right now, and you assume you actually click into that stated 38 without any rate breaks above and beyond that."", 'John C. Plant', ""So if I give you, let's say, the fourth quarter, we believe we delivered at rate 38, while Boeing built, let's say, rate 30. So in Q4, let's assume that 8 aircraft sets per month went into inventory. So there's 24 sets of parts which are sitting in Boeing inventory for the structural part, that our estimation.I don't think it's just quite the same on the engine side. Because what wasn't built in engines, let's say, the reduced engine build, which you've already had commentary from the engine manufacturers about that then the balance of the majority of the part, certainly on the turbine side, but not necessarily on the structural side, essentially went into service parts delivery into the MRO shops to account for what I already just talked about."", 'Noah Poponak', 'Okay.', 'John C. Plant', ""And so if you think about it, assuming that Boeing taking Q1 at 38, depending on what the final thing is, then there is that -- if they build, my assumption is 34, maybe they'll build at 38, that's why I've allowed for some choppiness as I already commented on and allowed for some inventory that we may end up carrying as that gets ironed out and with how many people we will recruit or we have already commented on that. And so it's this allowance for some of that choppiness within the margin rate incremental to a given calling out 28 versus 31 in Q4."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.', 'Scott Stephen Mikus', 'Scott Mikus on for Rob Spingarn. John, I wanted to ask you, the last time you had mentioned this, it was -- I believe you had 1.5x the relative market share of your closest competitor in the airfoils market. So just with the upgrade to the GTF, LEAP and then also thinking about the new engine agreement with an engine OEM customer that you referenced, where does your relative market share stand now in the airfoils market?', 'John C. Plant', ""Okay. We have grown about 1% share a year in the turbine airfoils market over the last, let's say, 4 or 5 years. So it's been a consistent march, and we believe we're just around that 50% mark currently. And we see that continuing to grow commensurate with some of the, I'll say, extraordinary levels of technology that we bring in that segment. And also a comment in there, we would not be considering, let's say, investing further in the scale that I've referred to, without knowledge of that share being there and indeed, I did say very clearly and unequivocally that we've also contracted additional share within that.So we continue to drive that improve it. And as you did hear, hopefully, is that's not changing our free cash flow guide metric, the conversion of net income."", 'Scott Stephen Mikus', 'Okay. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask, did you see any pickup in spot sales in 2023? And do you have any assumption for spot sales baked into the 2024 guide?', 'John C. Plant', ""Yes, we did see the spot market pick up further in '23. You can never be sure. So we've just assumed it's played again in 2024. And we did put in some security stock of material such that we could respond to the spot market and our balance sheet could take it. But we've not assume that it's like a further significant step up because it's always in that unknown area of indeed what hadn't been previously scheduled, what additional demands are there and sometimes the opportunity for an increased share if should somebody else not be able to deliver.So it's not an easy number to say. We assume that we're going to get more. I don't think that's a sensible way to plan."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.', 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""If I could ask maybe a 2-part question, just about all this 737 and just understanding that dynamic. You spoke, I guess, extensively about Boeing and the production rate there. Can you talk about the -- on the engine side, and kind of where that level of production is expected to be in 2024. And then on the -- on the airframe side, how much -- I assume most of the 737 content on the airframe side is in fasteners? And I guess, so how much of that goes directly to Boeing versus how much would be going to other suppliers like maybe Spirit especially.And so that would imply that your expectation in terms of the demand pull for Howmet would be more -- not even necessarily a demand pull from Boeing directly, but the demand pull from the, let's say, Tier 1 in the Boeing supply chain."", 'John C. Plant', ""Yes. So we do supply, I going to say, in terms of commercial for Boeing's requirements, we supply the majority directly to Boeing. But we also do supply to Spirit as an example and others that are also providing subassemblies to Boeing. And so again, it's never an absolutely clear picture. But we just assume like we've taken an assumption of a number of aircraft sets. It could be that Boeing build at one level, and maybe another supplier might build at a different level, and it's also compared to what they want to hold and also indeed what Boeing have by way of their minimum, maximum inventory holdings as well.So we operate on a min-max system, just roughly correlated to build, but it has times when it breaks that correlation. So it's never quite straightforward, Seth, I don't want to burn you with, I'll say, unnecessary detail, but the best assumption is just we've based ours on 34 and all of the other suppliers of rate 34 and knowing that at some point, that if Boeing have been scheduling at a higher rate and build the inventory has to come out and so they'll be held because there's going to be -- maybe the rate assumption will go up, maybe it will be 42, maybe it will 47 in 2025. And therefore, because it's really important that all the parts are there, so you avoid traveled work, which has been such a lot of commentary recently.So having supply security in all the parts available is really important. And therefore, it could well be that all of that will be held, which we don't know that. And at the same time, there's also the possibility is that given the cash strain that either Boeing or other suppliers may be under is that they will adjust inventory. So we've just taken that cautious view, prepared that against, for example, against the conversion of straight 90% of net income, which is a long-term guide.You can see from what we've given you this morning, it's like 85% plus or minus and that provides the allowance for just in case we have not only the growth rate that we expect, but also if we get of course holding to having to hold the bag in terms of a little bit lower take the natural schedules as some of those MAX inventories are adjusted. We don't know that. It's just an assumption. I mean clearly, what we hope for is that they build fully and at great quality levels of rate 38. That's what we want. That's what we hope for.We look for great success from our customers. We'd love to see that. And should they build on schedule and then increase schedules for an increase in rate in 2025 then that will be really good for us. And you could expect us to further increasing our sales should those scenarios play out. But at the moment, we're not prepared to go there because we don't know."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.', 'David Egon Strauss', ""So John, I guess, following up on that. So if I take 5% on the free cash flow conversion, it looks like it's about $50 million that you have assumed in working capital or inventory build related to conservatism around what Boeing takes. But even with that, it looks like or I guess on top of that, it looks like you've got maybe $100 million, $150 million of working capital usage in that free cash flow guidance. Is that correct? And if so, what is that? And the other part of the question is capital deployment. I know you don't have anything baked in, but how are you thinking about that given -- I know you have $200 million you've got left to retire this year, but that -- given the cash guide gives you a fair amount of room to do something on the share repurchase side."", 'John C. Plant', ""Yes. So you can ask like it's always these multipart questions, which we get here. So first of all, of course, given that revenues are increasing, let's call it $0.5 billion in the guide, there is a natural 15% to 20% working capital drag on that. So let's use the 20% because the math becomes so much easier. There's $100 million of working capital for you to which we added the sort of number that you talked about in terms of that propensity which might happen.So that's where we are on that assumption. And in terms of how we deploy, we haven't actually fixed anything at this point, but it's hardly likely that we're going to enter a refinancing for a couple of hundred million. So it's quite possible that we may decide just to retire that and take those interest rate savings into, let's say, end of the fourth quarter and into 2025. And therefore, you can assume that's all we're going to do probably. I mean, we could do a bit of a refi around the '25, that's on a TBD basis, but that's not going to be a big drag either which way a platform has quoted, any fee structure and breakage cost. But then the majority then you can assume it's going to be share buyback.So positional wise, you can assume that 2024 will be a bigger year for share buybacks compared to 2023, where you can see the majority of the action was further on the debt side to put our balance sheet into the great shape that it's currently in. And so roughly speaking, you can assume further leverage improvements despite the share buyback thoughts that we have at the moment, which are going to be elevated compared to 2023."", 'Operator', ""This concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has now concluded.

It\'s certainly difficult to argue that Nike isn\'t a permanent fixture of the world\'s cultural landscape.', ""And this matters.

But These 3 Shoe Stocks Have Better Growth and Profit Margins.,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f4ce8c80-dfcd-37c9-a6eb-a7f15a3fdb3e/nike-is-one-of-the-world%27s.html,1707890340,STORY,"['NKE', 'CROX', 'ONON', 'DECK']","['In the early 1970s, Nike (NYSE: NKE) was founded and its ""swoosh"" logo was unveiled. Then in the 1980s, the company signed basketball legend Michael Jordan to a marketing deal and the rest is history. Nike has grown so big and has been so successful that it\'s one of the most recognizable brands in the world.', ""Likely because of its consumer mind-share, Nike is more than just a popular shoe brand -- it's also a popular stock. But this is a little surprising to me right now. The company most recently reported financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2024. And through the first two quarters of this fiscal year, revenue was only up 1% from the comparable period of its fiscal 2023."", ""Far be it from me to criticize Nike. It's been one of the greatest stocks to own over the last 30 years. It's a reliable, global brand, and it earns good profits. Moreover, its earnings per share (EPS) have grown faster than revenue over the last 10 years, which is what investors want to see."", ""That said, to be a market-beating investment today, I think that Nike would need better growth. Management doesn't expect that to happen in the back half of its fiscal 2024. But it could come eventually -- investors will want to watch and see."", 'In the meantime, there are other good shoe stocks out there. Specifically, On Holding (NYSE: ONON), Crocs (NASDAQ: CROX), and Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) are three shoe companies with better growth than Nike right now. More than that, these companies also have better profit margins, which is why I believe all three could be better stocks to buy today.', ""When it comes to top-line growth, Switzerland's On Holding is the best among the companies here. Through the first three quarters of 2023, net sales are up 57% compared to the same period of 2022. The company's guidance for the fourth quarter implies just 21% growth. But even that is still faster than the growth from any of the other shoe companies we're discussing."", ""On is only 13 years old. However, it's encouragingly already gaining a lot of awareness from consumers. This is manifested in its direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenue. In its third quarter, DTC sales were up 55% year over year, outpacing overall sales growth of 47%. This suggests that consumers aren't just stumbling upon On's shoes in stores -- they're seeking out the brand."", 'Over the last four quarters, On\'s operating margin of 9% hasn\'t been quite as good as Nike\'s margin of nearly 12%. But perhaps this ""shortcoming"" can be overlooked given its far superior growth rate. Moreover, On\'s gross margin of 59% is better than Nike\'s margin of 44%, suggesting On may eventually command a higher operating margin as it gains scale.', 'My only concern with On stock is its pricey valuation -- it trades at more than 6 times sales, which is unusual for a shoe stock. In short, the market expects this company to become a powerhouse in the shoe space. Perhaps it will and the investment will pay off. Investors should just be aware that it has the priciest valuation of the bunch.', ""While On trades at 6 times its sales, Crocs stock trades at just 6 times its forward operating earnings -- that's quite cheap. In 2024, the company expects its revenue to exceed $4 billion and for its adjusted operating margin to be 25%. That would give it $1 billion in adjusted operating income compared to a market cap of less than $6.5 billion."", ""Of course, there's a trade-off here for investors. Crocs is a cheaper stock but its growth is much slower as well. On Feb. 15, the company expects to report full-year revenue of $3.95 billion, which would represent 11% growth. And for 2024, it's already guiding for just 3% to 5% growth."", ""However, that growth is still better than Nike's. Moreover, Crocs can make up for its slowing growth with high profits and shareholder friendly moves. Two things the company is doing right now are paying down debt ($277 million in the fourth quarter alone) and repurchasing shares. To this latter point, it still has almost $900 million in repurchase authorization left, which is almost 14% of outstanding shares."", ""Moves like these can help move the needle for Crocs' shareholders. And it's why I believe this is a better buy than Nike today as well."", ""Finally, we come to Deckers Outdoor -- the best-performing stock on this list. Over the past 10 years, it's up 942% compared to 603% and 188% for Crocs and Nike, respectively. On Holding only went public in 2021. But since it went public, Deckers stock is outperforming On stock as well."", 'Deckers owns the shoe brands Hoka and Ugg, and the company is enjoying better growth than Nike right now. Its fiscal 2024 ends on March 31. And for fiscal 2024, it expects net sales of $4.15 billion, which represents 14% year-over-year growth.', 'Like On, Deckers is enjoying a great increase in brand awareness, as manifested by its DTC growth. DTC sales were up almost 23% in its fiscal third quarter of 2024, better than its 16% overall growth.', ""I like Deckers stock better than Nike stock today -- I've already mentioned its superior growth. But I like it for other reasons too. It expects its full-year operating margin to be 20%, which is among the best in the business. Moreover, this company is debt-free and has almost $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents, giving it financial fortitude as well."", ""That said, of these three shoe stocks, I like Crocs stock the best -- I believe its valuation is the safest and it has a path to market-beating upside by smartly using its profits. After that, I like On stock in spite of its valuation, because it's a promising growth story with good economics."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in On Holding right now?', 'Before you buy stock in On Holding, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and On Holding wasn’t one of them.

Last year, the ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100—the QQQ—soared 54.8%. But there’s a dark side to all that potential upside: Tech stocks are notoriously volatile. The QQQ in 2022 fell a dizzying 32.6%, far more than the market as a whole. Which got us thinking—after a year in which tech was the story, what other stocks might have gotten overlooked? Below, we found five steady bets that each enjoyed double-digit returns over the past decade, which speaks to their staying power, a characteristic that Wall Street seers call “quality.” And they’re still poised to deliver tech-like returns, while rounding out a broader portfolio.', '10-year annualized\xa0price rise: 12.6%Market cap: $72 billion', 'The world’s largest derivatives exchange operator, CME Group, stands apart from the largely plodding share performance of its financial services peers. Its stock vaulted 31% last year, yet its price/earnings ratio, at 24, is still not much more expensive than the S&P\xa0500 (with a price/earnings ratio of 21), and far cheaper than the QQQ (32).', 'CME’s outperformance doesn’t surprise Max Wasserman, cofounder and senior portfolio manager at asset management firm Miramar Capital. Reason: It has great growth potential. “They are very profitable,” he says, “and they have more volume in the works.”', 'Indeed, derivatives keep expanding in scope, adding futures and options on all manner of assets, from commodities to currencies to stocks to interest rates, per the World Federation of Exchanges. In dollar terms, derivatives enjoy double-digit annual growth.', 'Globally, the derivatives market is about seven times the size of the equities market. The recent boost in interest rates actually helped CME, because that increases the need for interest rate hedges, via derivatives.', 'CME (originally named the Chicago Mercantile Exchange) has gobbled up rivals like the Chicago Board of Trade as it pushed beyond futures for crops and livestock. As Morningstar analyst Michael Miller writes, CME “has assembled a diverse set of derivative products … Weakness in one product is often offset by strength in another.”', '10-year annualized price rise: 11%Market cap: $155 billion', 'A temporary stumble on the track obscures the strength of Nike. It has had to work down bloated inventory, endure a sales slowdown in its important Chinese market, and beat back competition from upstarts like Hoka. The stock is off its 2021 high of $180, and took a new tumble starting in December after Nike tamped down sales expectations.', 'Still, the company, ranked as the world’s most valuable brand by consulting firm Brand Finance, hasn’t lost its cachet. Nike is embarking on $2\xa0billion in cost cuts over three years, as well as a plan to hike its use of technology and automation to streamline operations.', '“This is a turnaround story, and Nike has to take its medicine,” says Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. Nike is focusing on direct-to-consumer sales, hoping to increase this profitable channel from 45% up to 60% of revenue. Nike wants to return its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) margin, lately 13.2%, to the mid-teens, where it was in 2021. And there’s good reason to believe that Nike can, you guessed it, just do it.', '10-year annualized price rise: 19.4%Market cap: $533 billion', 'Visa introduced the world to the credit card in 1956—and has fended off competitors fiercely ever since. “A wide moat surrounds the business, and Visa’s position in the global electronic payment infrastructure is essentially unassailable,” writes Morningstar analyst Brett Horn. Small wonder that the stock has done well: Over 10 years, it beat the QQQ, and increased 26.2% in 2023. In snakebitten 2022, the stock lost just 3.4%. For the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30, Visa’s earnings jumped 15% and revenue was up 11%. In a shareholder-friendly move, during the past fiscal year, it bought back $12.4 billion in stock, and the board authorized more repurchases at double that amount. The company’s profit margin is a stunning 55%.', 'Visa has the most credit cards in circulation, with almost half the market, according to Bankrate. Mastercard comes in second at 36%, leaving Discover and American Express claiming small shares.', 'Visa’s asset-light business involves licensing its cards to banks. So it has relatively low debt, with a ratio to Ebitda of just 1.0. Return on capital over the past five years is a healthy 29%.', '10-year annualized price rise: 13.4%Market cap: $127 billion', 'For decades, electric utilities have been plodders, their stocks edging up in small, single-digit increments. They are typically the lowest performers among the 11 S&P 500 equity sectors.', 'That’s not the picture of NextEra Energy, which owns utilities—and is the largest renewable-power generator in the U.S. NextEra stock has regularly beaten the S&P\xa0500 index for the past 10 years. “NextEra has been a market darling, and the clear leader on clean energy,” observes Burns McKinney, a senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group.', 'By 2030, the world will need to quadruple its spending to upgrade aging electricity infrastructure and build new capacity, a McKinsey & Co. study finds.', 'Electricity-hungry data centers, EVs, and household heat pumps are all thirsty for power.\xa0 Enter NextEra, whose strong balance sheet and solid profitability are more than able to pay for the transformation to renewables. Dividends are healthy, sporting a 3% yield. Earnings per share have climbed at a rapid clip over the past few years, topping analysts’ forecasts. The company is divided into two parts: one an old-school cash cow making up 70% of the business called Florida Power & Light, the other the renewables unit. FPL has two nuclear power plants and a network of natural gas pipelines, and services a state with a swelling population. ', 'Operating throughout the U.S. and Canada, this non-carbon division is one of the world’s biggest producers of solar and wind power. For forward-looking energy investors, NextEra is well positioned.', '10-year annualized price rise: 17.7%Market cap: $76 billion', '“A housing boom is coming, and Sherwin-Williams will piggyback onto it,” predicts Freedom Capital’s Woods.', 'With rates likely coming down and a growing population, young adults who have been delaying homeownership may get a chance to jump in—and that’s great news for the world’s largest paint and coatings producer. Sherwin-Williams has 4,900 stores and adds nearly 100 new ones yearly, while its products also stock the shelves of big-box stores. More than three-fourths of Sherwin-Williams’s business occurs in North America, with much of its international exposure acquired through the 2016 purchase of Minneapolis-based Valspar.', 'Sherwin-Williams mainly caters to professional painters. “Its strategic focus on building this segment has created a strong value proposition for contractors,” writes Morningstar analyst Spencer Liberman in a research note. “Job site delivery, in-app ordering, and a capacity for high-volume orders save time for customers and allows for premium product pricing.”', 'Revenue and earnings have steadily risen. The stock, while on the pricey side with a P/E of 32, gained a market-beating 32.5% in 2023 and has the second-best 10-year price history of our five picks.', 'With stats like those, investors could be forgiven for overlooking tech stocks in favor of steady favorites this year.', 'This article appears in the February/March 2024 issue of Fortune.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

But a year after Nike Golf got out of the equipment business, Adidas sold TaylorMade to a private investment company. That allowed Woods to switch his golf equipment to TaylorMade, ultimately the start to what led to this new brand.', 'WHAT IS SUN DAY RED?', ""Abeles and Woods described it as a premium active lifestyle brand. This is as much performance on the golf course as comfort at his children's soccer games."", ""The rollout will be gradual, starting May 1 online in the U.S. and Canada before expanding to key markets.

Some of the outwear has block letters of “Sun Day Red” written along the side of the quarter zip.', '“The logo is sustainable and applicable, but it’s not unilaterally the same,” Abeles said. “We also think in lifestyle, it’s nice to have some tonal logos when you’re out at night.”', 'WHY IS IT SPELLED THAT WAY?', 'The Sunday red is obvious.', '“Sunday red — it’s me,” Woods said. “It’s just become synonymous with me.”', 'So why the three words?

Woods, for example, is fond of saying his goals in golf were, “Work hard, think hard, play hard.”', 'Abeles said “Sun” also can mean the preferred weather (missing at Pebble Beach). Day can also mean that golf is played every day of the week.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) will no doubt be intrigued by the recent purchase of shares by Bracken Darrell, President of the company, who spent a stonking US$1.0m on stock at an average price of US$15.38. That purchase boosted their holding by 83%, which makes us wonder if the move was inspired by quietly confident deeply-felt optimism.', ' View our latest analysis for V.F ', ""Notably, that recent purchase by Bracken Darrell is the biggest insider purchase of V.F shares that we've seen in the last year. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$16.44 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices."", ""V.F insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any.

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.', 'Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that V.F insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$59m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.', ""The recent insider purchase is heartening. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses.

Corporate boards have a fiduciary obligation to listen to suggestions by an activist as they would any other shareholder. But sometimes things can get really nasty between the activist and the boards of the companies they target.', 'One example is the tit-for-tat squabble at Gildan Activewear between the Gildan board and institutional investor Browning West as each side jockeyed for position to gain the support of shareholders. But those trading of jabs also polarize the parties further when they really should be focused on reaching an agreement on a common goal, which is what’s best for the company.', 'So who is Engaged Capital?', 'The firm, based in Newport Beach, Calif., was founded in 2012 by Glenn Welling, who serves as principal and chief investment officer. It focuses its activist efforts on small and mid-cap public companies that are deemed undervalued. Investments often have a two- to five-year time horizon. Unlike activists who seem pushier, Welling’s constructive engagement approach appears somewhat low-key in comparison. But it’s one that’s just as effective, if not more so, than Engaged’s more boisterous activist counterparts.', 'And while the company over the years has had investments across multiple sectors, one of Engaged’s successful activist plays in retail was its ability to influence specialty apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch. Co. to improve its corporate governance. One move was to bring in Arthur Martinez in early 2014 as non-executive chairman, which resulted in the stripping of then CEO Michael Jeffries’ chairmanship and pushing him off the board. Martinez is best known as the CEO who led a turnaround of the former Sears, Roebuck & Co. retail chain in the 1990s.', 'But Engaged also pushed to have Jeffries, who held the CEO post since 1992, removed. Jeffries, who began his CEO tenure in 1992, left the retailer when he retired in December 2014. Towards the end of his tenure, Jeffries came under fire both for his stewardship of the company and for a series or public relations gaffes, including a statement in 2013 that the Abercrombie brand was only intended to be worn by “cool kids.”', 'In the case of VF Corp., Engaged took a stake in the apparel giant last October. It said The North Face, Vans, and Timberland owner should sell some of its real estate and look at options for assets beyond its biggest powerhouse brands, as well as shake up the board. The hedge fund also has said that VF underinvested in Vans, while former CEO Steve Rendle “pursued a risky M&A strategy” when it acquired streetwear brand Supreme in 2020 for $2.1 billion.', 'Engaged’s constructive engagement approach seems to be working. VF in November disclosed its Reinvent strategy, a plan to cuts costs including the elimination of 500 jobs. And last week VF said it was conducting a strategic review of non-core assets so it could pay down a crippling $1.7 billion debt load, of which $1 billion is due Dec. 30, 2024 and $700 million due on April 23, 2025.']"

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with PFE.', 'The stock has a GF value of approximately $39 per share compared to a current share price of roughly $27. However, I believe the stock lacks any near-term catalyst to drive a closure of this gap.', ""The company has struggled over the past three years as sales of the company's Covid-19 vaccine and related products have declined. 2023 sales came in at approximately $58.50 billion, which represents a roughly 42% decline from 2022 levels. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.84, representing a roughly 72% decline from 2022 levels. Excluding the impact of the company's Covid-19-related products (Comirnaty and Paxlovid), revenue grew by 8%."", 'On March 13, Pfizer announced plans to acquire Seagen in an all-cash deal for roughly $43 billion, or $229 per share. Prior to the announcement of the deal, Seagen shared had been trading at $172 per share. In order to finance this deal, Pfizer issued $31 billion in new unsecured notes and used cash and existing short-term financing from its balance sheet. The transaction was completed in December 2023.', 'Pfizer shares have dropped by roughly 30% since the transaction was first announced. I believe part of the reason for the decline is that shareholders are somewhat skeptical of the large valuation premium paid by the company. Moreover, the financing of the transaction resulted in a significant increase in debt and a more highly levered balance sheet than was previously the case.', 'PFE Data by GuruFocus', ""The company expects 2024 revenue to come between $58.50 billion and $61.50 billion. This is in line with current consensus estimates, which call for revenue to come in close to $60 billion. The company expects adjusted earnings of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, which is slightly below current consensus estimates of $2.41. While a stabilization of financial results is a positive, I do not view it as a catalyst to send shares higher given the company's guidance is broadly in line with consensus estimates."", ""Pfizer's forward price-earnings ratio of 12.40 is cheap relative to the broader market, which trades closer to 22 times forward earnings. However, the company's valuation is somewhat less compelling compared to peers and its own historical norm."", ""Over the past 10 years, the stock has traded at an average of 15.70 times adjusted earnings. Some of the company's key peers include Merck (NYSE:MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Astrazeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Novartis (NYSE:NVS). These companies trade at approximately 14.90, 7.20, 16.30 and 14.50 times forward earnings respectively."", 'Based on these metrics, despite a very low price-earnings ratio relative to the broader market, I view Pfizer as only modestly attractive relative to historical norms and peers. Thus, I would only consider buying the stock if an upside catalyst were to materialize.', ""One potential upside catalyst for Pfizer would be a potential increase in Covid-19 vaccination rates. Its Covid product, Comirnaty, was the company's best-selling product in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 37.60% of the total revenue. Just over 505 million doses of its original vaccine were delivered in the U.S. while just 90 million doses of its booster have been delivered in the U.S. A major pickup in cases could result in increased demand for booster shots. However, this seems unlikely given the recent trajectory of interest in Covid-19 vaccines."", ""Another potential upside catalyst would be successful product launches and sales from the company's oncology pipeline. Pfizer doubled the size of its oncology pipeline when it acquired Seagen. The company believes it can deliver at least eight blockbuster products by 2030. On its third-quarter conference call, the company suggested it believes revenue related to Seagen can reach $10 billion by 2030 from an expected level of $3.10 billion for 2024. This growth is dependent on successful product launches, which can be difficult to predict."", 'Share repurchases would also represent a positive catalyst. The company currently has a share repurchase authorization of $3.30 billion. However, the company has said it does not anticipate any share repurchases in 2024 as it remains focused on debt reduction.', ""Pfizer is a cheap stock trading at a valuation well below the broader market. The company has experienced declining revenue and earnings over the past year as Covid-19 product sales have dropped. The company's recent acquisition of Seagen was transformational in nature, but the ultimate success of the deal will depend on pipeline realization."", 'The stock is currently trading at a modest discount to most peers and at a modest discount to its average historical valuation.

In Phase 1b, escalating doses of samuraciclib and vepdegestrant will be tested to determine appropriate doses of each therapy to be used in combination. In Phase 2, additional patients will be enrolled to further explore the safety and efficacy of the selected doses.', 'This clinical trial evaluating the novel combination of samuraciclib and vepdegestrant is being conducted as part of the TACTIVE-U study in collaboration with Arvinas and Pfizer under a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement.

In preclinical studies, vepdegestrant demonstrated up to 97% ER degradation in tumor cells, induced robust tumor shrinkage when dosed as a single agent in multiple ER-driven xenograft models, and showed increased anti-tumor activity when compared to a standard of care agent, fulvestrant, both as a single agent and in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. In July 2021, Arvinas announced a global collaboration with Pfizer for the co-development and co-commercialization of vepdegestrant; Arvinas and Pfizer will equally share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses, and profits. Ongoing and planned clinical trials will continue to monitor and evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of vepdegestrant.', 'About Samuraciclib (CT7001)Samuraciclib is the most advanced CDK7 inhibitor in clinical development. Inhibiting CDK7 is a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer as CDK7 regulates the transcription of cancer-causing genes, promotes uncontrolled cell cycle progression and promotes resistance to anti-hormone therapy. Samuraciclib has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and encouraging efficacy in early clinical studies. In addition to the above studies, samuraciclib has further potential in prostate, pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancers. Samuraciclib has been granted Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of CDK4/6i resistant HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. Carrick is collaborating with Roche, Menarini Group and Arvinas/Pfizer to evaluate novel combinations of samuraciclib with Roche’s oral SERD giredestrant, Menarini Group’s oral SERD elacestrant, and Arvinas/Pfizer’s proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) Estrogen Receptor degrader vepdegestrant (ARV-471) in late-stage CDK4/6i resistant HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer.', 'About Carrick TherapeuticsCarrick Therapeutics is an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company developing highly differentiated novel therapies that address significant unmet needs.

Big Blue started shifting its business strategy in 2012 under then-CEO Ginni Rometty, but many investors were uncomfortable with sacrificing revenue growth in order to refocus on future growth markets such as cloud computing, data security, and artificial intelligence (AI).', ""So here we are in 2024, those exact target markets are the hottest areas of the digital arena, and IBM's stock has finally been given a ticket to climb aboard the broader stock market's AI bandwagon. Thanks to a stellar fourth-quarter report, with more than a dash of AI orders, IBM stock is trading at prices not seen since the summer of 2014."", ""IBM's commitment to AI is starting to pay off, and the company's AI-powered, cloud-based growth story has only just begun. The success story so far is the tip of a much larger iceberg. It may have been a bit late to Wall Street's AI party, but I expect a massive growth spurt from this tech sector stalwart."", ""At this point, IBM has spent more than a decade whittling itself down from its former one-stop-shop approach into a sleeker, more efficient bundle of high-growth operations. Pointing such a huge business in a new direction takes time and patience. It's like an oil tanker making a U-turn in San Francisco Bay -- a slow operation requiring great care."", ""This level of patience also applies to IBM's day-to-day operations. Big Blue is happy to let other companies fight among themselves to cater to fickle consumer tastes."", ""IBM is all about business-to-business services. Once you win a multiyear contract in this market segment, you'll have a reliable revenue stream for a long time. Moreover, corporate deals tend to be lucrative, with generous profit margins and side orders of technical support services."", ""Nothing good is ever free, and there's a significant downside to IBM's tight enterprise focus. It takes a while to get the necessary John Hancocks on a large, long-lasting software contract. A prospective client must put the new tool through the paces by testing its functionality, security, integration with existing systems, and more. Then, the company's IT director may need budget sign-offs from several layers of management. Moreover, AI platforms can be controversial, slowing down the process even further."", ""So it's not surprising to see IBM's AI wins are coming in a bit late. The company is taking the long way around to this opportunity. On the upside, there will be large, fruitful, and durable contracts at the end of the rainbow."", ""Big Blue isn't building another multipurpose ChatGPT platform. Its solutions are aimed at enterprise-class corporations that have the developer know-how to apply AI analytics and deep learning to their proprietary business data."", ""IBM also goes the extra mile to explain how its AI systems reach their conclusions. That's the only way to deliver business-grade insights. Thanks to Watson's transparency, a client can audit the analysis and make sure the AI conclusions are based on good data. Clients can trust those audited analyses more than they would an AI solution that came from a black box the inner workings of which are inscrutable."", ""Even now, with AI orders piling up and driving deeper market interest in IBM's Watson and Watsonx solutions, IBM won't become a get-rich-quick stock. Converting firm service contracts (including the modern software-as-a-service approach to software licenses) doesn't result in big lump sums on the income statement right away. Instead, recurring revenue streams are collected from customers on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. So the impressive volume of AI orders coming down IBM's pipeline will look more like a slow groundswell of modest growth in revenues and profits."", ""But you know what they say about successful investing: It's a marathon, not a sprint. IBM is taking its sweet time cementing the foundation of an incredibly lucrative AI business, and I don't mind that at all. It's a much smarter strategy than rushing the process and losing out on a robust tide of long-lasting AI deals."", ""IBM's AI success was decades in the making, but these are the early days of its financial impact. The stock still trades at just 2.7 times sales and 13.6 times free cash flow, making it a red-tag value play next to AI darlings such as Nvidia or Microsoft. IBM stock could double or triple in price and still look like a bargain by comparison."", ""Finally, you know IBM was built to last. The company has been around since the 1800s, deftly switching target markets to stay relevant and profitable through a plethora of sea changes and calamities. The AI shift is another example of this shareholder-friendly management approach. And don't forget that you can lock in a generous 3.6% dividend yield right now, backed by mountains of cash profits and 28 straight years of annual payout boosts."", 'For all intents and purposes, IBM looks ready to make money for us ordinary investors forever.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team\xa0has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With a dividend of $6.64 per share yearly, at current share prices, it offers a yield of 3.6%, and the company has a 27-year streak of annual payout hikes.

Over the last year, it is up more than 35% and could soon return to the all-time high it touched in 2013.

Investors like Warren Buffett have exited their positions in TSMC out of fear of the possibility that China might invade Taiwan, which is home to most of the company's chip fabrication facilities."", ""However, almost every chip design company depends on TSMC for its manufacturing. Thus, companies such as Nvidia and AMD face this same risk, even though it is likely not priced into their stocks. Secondly, China also depends on TSMC's chips, making it less likely it would put its economy at risk with an invasion."", 'Investors may have started to notice as TSMC stock has risen more than 40% over the past year. That has taken its P/E ratio to 26. While its earnings multiple has significantly increased over the previous few months, TSMC routinely traded at more than 30 times earnings during the 2021 bull market.', 'Also, analysts forecast a 10% surge in profits for this year and a 23% increase in 2025.

As such, T-Mobile does not have legacy costs such as pensions, nor does it face extensive environmental cleanup costs from old lead-lined cables -- just two of the concerns that are currently plaguing those competitors.', 'For these reasons, it has long been free to spend its capital on its wireless networks and acquisitions, and to offer price cuts that have squeezed the profit margins of its peers. All of this has allowed T-Mobile to grow its market share to around 24%.', ""Although T-Mobile's share price rose only 12% last year, the telecom stock outperformed its peers. It has also risen by nearly 875% since its inception, making it more of a growth stock."", 'However, its P/E ratio of 23 is low by historical standards.

You can skip our detailed analysis of high dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks in the Dow.\xa0', 'Dividend yield holds significant importance in dividend investing, serving as a key metric for investors. Experts often recommend prioritizing companies that demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payouts over time. Nevertheless, there is also notable interest among investors in companies offering high dividend yields. Over time, high-yielding stocks and companies with consistent dividend growth have demonstrated comparable performance, showing a close race in their investment returns. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series employs a distinctive methodology aimed at tracking the performance of 100 stocks with high dividend yields across various markets. These stocks are chosen based on their consistent history of dividend payments and strong fundamental metrics. Over the long term, this index has demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains compared to standard benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index achieved an annualized total return of 11.7%, surpassing its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which yielded 10.2% annually. Similarly, in the international market, the Dow Jones International Dividend 100 Index outperformed its benchmark, the S&P Global Ex-U.S. LargeMidCap, in both price return and total return over the past 15 years.', 'Heartland Advisors conducted an in-depth analysis utilizing data provided by Kenneth French, sourced from the US Stock Database Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. This dataset encompassed all equity securities listed on major US exchanges, including NYSE, Amex, NASDAQ, and NYSE Arca, spanning from 1928 through 2017. The study focused on examining monthly and annual value-weighted total returns of non-dividend-paying U.S. stocks and five portfolios consisting of dividend-paying stocks. These portfolios were constructed based on dividend yields. The research tracked the performance of each portfolio from January 1928 to December 2017, with dividends reinvested. Notably, the findings revealed that all portfolios comprising dividend-paying stocks outperformed the portfolio comprised solely of non-dividend-paying stocks over the entire period studied. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, in general, portfolios with higher dividend yields tended to outperform those with lower dividend yields. This suggests a positive correlation between dividend yield and investment performance, with higher-yielding quintiles demonstrating stronger returns compared to lower-yielding quintiles.', ""The impressive performance of high-yielding dividend stocks has garnered significant popularity among investors, leading many to turn to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a key source for such investment opportunities. Employing a strategy known as the 'Dogs of the Dow', investors focus on acquiring the highest-yielding stocks within the DJIA. The outcomes of this strategy have been varied and inconsistent over time. According to data sourced from Barron's in one of our articles, over a 20-year period ending in 2023, the Dogs of the Dow strategy yielded an average annual return slightly above 8%, inclusive of dividends. This performance lags behind the S&P 500 by a little over 1% annually.

', 'Despite the fact that it is one of the more mature industries in the world, the global energy industry remains as dynamic as ever. Every day investors, analysts, government officials, and members of the press painstakingly go over developments in the energy industry to see if they will have any implications on the global business and economic environments. After all, energy, which constitutes primarily of petroleum products and fuels, is the backbone of the modern day world and without it life as we know would come to a standstill.', ""This also makes energy stocks quite lucrative when it comes to both share price growth and stability. The general trend on the stock market sees sizeable firms primarily preferred for their safety and stoutness since their markets are not as risky as those for other firms, particularly those that belong to high growth sectors such as technology. While this naturally benefits energy stocks, at the same time, should the cards align, then energy stocks can deliver spectacular returns that are furthered and sweetened by juicy dividends due to the billions of dollars in profit that they make each year. If you're wondering which energy stocks are the most profitable and make the most money, wonder no more and take a look at 12 Most Profitable Energy Stocks."", 'As an illustration, consider the largest publicly traded energy companies by revenue. The three largest energy stocks in terms of revenue that trade on NYSE are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL), and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). The most significant year for the global energy industry in recent times was 2022, and it came just a year after energy stocks nosedived as global demand for their products faltered in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The Russian invasion of Ukraine upended the industry as European nations scuttled to find alternative fuel supplies. This saw Exxon, Shell, and Total report record revenues, and their shares jumped in double digit percentages during the early days of the war.', ""Since then, the global energy market has stabilized and energy stocks have come back to earth. Their revenues have returned to 'normal' readings after a bumper 2022, and in 2024, the outlook for the global energy industry has divided the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The IEA's first energy outlook report issued in January 2024 outlined that the agency believes that one of the biggest risks to the global oil industry lies in the escalation of the crisis in the Middle East. What initially started as a devastating attack by Hamas on Israel has now spiralled into a broader low intensity conflict involving the Houthi rebel group attacking global shipping lines and a coalition led by the United States and Great Britain responding by military action. Things came to a head just as the year started after an attack led to U.S. service member deaths and left the world in jitters for a while as it contemplated how the world's most powerful country would respond."", ""On the other hand, OPEC released an unprecedented report that not only remained optimistic but also attempted to stabilize oil prices. The optimism wasn't unprecedented with the body sharing that it expects non OPEC liquids production to grow this year. It also released an oil industry forecast for 2025, a rare announcement that saw OPEC share a 12 month+ forecast for its industry. This was done to make sure speculators wouldn't be able to inject volatility into oil prices, an occurrence that the Saudis believe was responsible for recent weakness in the oil market. OPEC expects that global oil demand will grow by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2025, bolstered by an economic recovery in China."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top energy stocks according to hedge funds, with the notable picks being Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)."", ""A pipeline snaking through a desert canyon, representing a energy's transport infrastructure."", 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the best energy stocks, we ranked the 40 most valuable energy stocks that traded on NYSE and the NASDAQ by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares as of Q3 2023.

If you want to skip our overview of autonomous driving and how it's one of the most important sectors today especially when we consider the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy Now. "", ""The biggest trend in the stock market these days is artificial intelligence. While data science has been an industry for years, artificial intelligence has come to the public's attention only because of OpenAI's massive success with ChatGPT. Before ChatGPT became available for public use, data science was primarily used in industrial cases such as supply chain management, drug and vaccine development, fraud detection, and others."", ""Another application that relies heavily on data science is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving is the technology that relies on a computer to aid a driver while they're on the road, and the industry has been able to progress quite a bit over the past couple of years. In fact, the same drivers of the A.I. wave, i.e. semiconductors designed and sold by firms such as NVIDIA Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), are also behind the rapid progress of autonomous driving systems."", 'These systems are made by public and private companies, and the former are traded on the stock markets as autonomous driving stocks. Autonomous driving stocks are those companies whose hardware or software is present in autonomous driving systems, or whose business operations are indispensable to the functioning of the autonomous driving industry. The potential of car makers to continuously gather data from every vehicle as it is being driven and then use this data to train algorithms that are capable of making driving decisions on their own has proven to be quite beneficial to autonomous driving stocks.', ""In fact, the world's most valuable car maker in terms of market capitalization, the Austin, Texas based electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) owes, some, if not most, of its market value to the simple fact that the firm's first principles driven approach led by its chief Elon Musk has enabled it to also operate as a technology company. This has made Tesla the world's most valuable autonomous driving stock, and the firm's massive market capitalization of $588 billion is based on its production systems and the massive amounts of data it has at its disposal to train its autonomous driving product, the Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) platform."", ""However, while Tesla's FSD continues to remain functional and operational despite the daily dose of controversy surrounding it, 2024 has also seen some other autonomous driving stocks struggle. One such autonomous driving stock is General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), whose Cruise autonomous driving system underwent a tragic accident in October last year that led California to pull its permits. Since then, a crucial GM update provided in January 2024 has created uncertainty about Cruise's future, and some quarters worry whether it will be able to regain compliance by the end of this year, especially after having laid off 25% of its workforce."", ""Since Tesla's FSD is in a world of its own, its rivals such as GM compete with each other. Another mega cap stock that is also an autonomous driving stock is none other than the consumer technology behemoth Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Now structured as a holding company that makes money from or funds the losses of a variety of lucrative business, one such Alphabet division is Waymo. When it comes to California, Waymoe and Cruise account for 99% of the test driving miles in 2023. And now, as Cruise's future becomes uncertain, Waymo has the 'road clear' when it comes to develop autonomous driving technologies."", ""As for Cruise, here is what General Motors had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:"", 'Our plan 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadence go-to-market strategy and we are developing new financial targets and a new roadmap. Spending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware, and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable, profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise EVs to the road soon. To summarize, we learned a lot in 2023, and those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholding value.', 'You’ll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV, and software plans, while meeting our financial targets. So our goals are truly aligned with yours. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches, and we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all four pillars of our strategy, ICE, EV, AV, and software. When we do get together, we will show you what we’ve done, not just tell you what we’re going to do.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.

This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', 'We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.', 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Paccar passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Paccar shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.', 'How Does PCAR Stack Up to the Competition?', 'Shares of PCAR have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is General Motors Company (GM). GM has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of C.', 'Earnings were strong last quarter. General Motors Company beat our consensus estimate by 10.71%, and for the current fiscal year, GM is expected to post earnings of $8.83 per share on revenue of $175.3 billion.', 'Shares of General Motors Company have gained 11.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 4.45X and a P/CF of 2.01X.', 'The Automotive - Domestic industry may rank in the bottom 63% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for PCAR and GM, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As in any enduring partnership, adaptability and resilience are essential and as the landscape of community development evolves, the alliance between banks and CDFIs must continue to grow, innovate and adapt to the challenges and opportunities of the current economic environment."", 'Despite the complexities of pandemic recovery, Black, Latino and other communities of color have shown remarkable resilience. Although CDFIs have historically been a key resource for these communities, the current uncertain economic environment makes it more challenging to provide the innovative capital products community investors are known for.', 'In times like these, our partnerships as financial institutions in communities are more needed than ever. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, targeted investments during the pandemic, like stimulus payments, kept 1.3 million Latino and 756,000 Black children out of poverty. Data from the Startup Cartography Project highlight a surge in small business formation in communities with a higher percentage of Black residents. Significant bounce-backs from economic challenges occur in communities, particularly communities of color, with targeted investment.', ""Such progress, however, is fragile and vulnerable to retrenchment. Borrowers have felt the adverse effects of higher interest rates, tighter credit standards and other inflationary pressures. Yet, LIIF's and PNC's commitments remain unwavering: PNC's Community Benefits Plan pledges $88 billion in loans, investments, and other financial support to advance economic opportunities, including $400 million to support CDFIs in underserved communities, and in its first year PNC deployed $35.1 billion to bring this commitment to life.

Patient, flexible and risk tolerant capital is more critical than ever. When this type of catalytic financing is strategically deployed, it stimulates positive social or environmental outcomes, often in situations where traditional market forces alone may not be sufficient to achieve our goals. Catalytic capital routinely attracts additional investments and creates a ripple effect of positive change, ultimately fostering sustainable impact and positive systemic transformation.', 'Historically, PNC and LIIF have stood at the forefront of such collaborations. Our collective efforts have not only translated into significant financial commitments but have also yielded tangible, transformative outcomes. For instance, we have jointly directed capital toward projects that have made a positive impact on local economies such as Naturally Occurring Affordable Housing, a development group making workforce housing more accessible throughout San Diego and Escondido.', 'Together, we are pushing our sector to expand access to catalytic capital, leverage federal resources, and pave the way for a future where our collaborations uplift communities, foster innovation, and drive lasting change.

Yes, it’s intentional.” She said when you see all the things placed together, you’re more likely to buy an entire collection as a whole package versus individual items.', 'Cruze said the next time you start feeling all warm and cozy in a giant superstore that’s not your home, you need to realize that it’s probably a sneaky merchandising trap.', 'Cruze pointed out that Target, like a lot of stores, sells seasonal items because they know people will buy them. For example, when the season changes from summer to fall, people start feeling optimistic and happy about the fall season and the upcoming holidays, which makes them less likely to say no to making a seasonal purchase, such as a fall-scented candle.', 'Cruze said that before you go into Target when it’s selling seasonal stuff, you need to give yourself a pep talk.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) share price is up 91% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 70% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 21% , including dividends ."", ""So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns."", ' See our latest analysis for Visa ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'During five years of share price growth, Visa achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 14%. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.', 'You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""We know that Visa has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts."", ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Visa's TSR for the last 5 years was 97%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""It's good to see that Visa has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 21% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 15%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately.

238,4ccc6e2d-d58f-3321-bd69-b61a79368178,V,2024-02-14,Visa Stock (NYSE:V): Is Its Growth Slowdown Cause for Concern?,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-stock-nyse-v-growth-215645417.html,1707861405,STORY,['V'],"['Visa (NYSE:V) recently posted its Q1-2024 results, with revenue growth implying a notable slowdown in the business. The card payments processor giant grew its top line by roughly 9%, marking the worst growth rate in the past 2.5 years. While this could be a cause for concern, viewing this in perspective is essential. In fact, with anticipated acceleration in growth in the second half of 2024, this will likely be another exciting year for Visa. Thus, my outlook on Visa stock remains bullish.', 'Visa’s Q4 results continued a trend that has persisted for several quarters now – that of decelerating revenue growth. Take a look at the company’s revenue growth over the past eight quarters:', 'Q4-2020: 28.6%', 'Q1:2021: 24.1%', 'Q2-2021: 25.5%', 'Q3-2021: 18.7%', 'Q4-2021: 18.7%', 'Q1-2022: 12.4%', 'Q2-2023: 11.1%', 'Q3-2023: 11.7%', 'Q4-2023 \xa010.5%', 'Q1-2024: 8.8%', 'Visa’s revenue deceleration appears to have formed a clear trend over the past 2.5 years. However, it’s crucial to interpret these numbers in the context of Visa’s overall growth trajectory, which hasn’t been slowing down but rather normalizing. The remarkable 20%+ growth rates observed in 2020-21 were inflated due to a substantial post-pandemic surge in consumer spending, which has since subsided.', 'Now that a full normalization is likely already underway, we can anticipate Visa’s growth returning to its historical mean, hovering in the low double-digits. Although the 8.8% revenue growth to $8.6 billion in Q1 might signal a potential shift in the wrong direction, I remain optimistic about a quick rebound in Visa’s growth.', 'The most recent quarter’s dip can be attributed to a temporary slowdown in U.S. spending during October, leading to a modest 5% increase in domestic (U.S.) payment volumes. However, management has indicated a rebound in growth during November and December, suggesting that these challenges are primarily of cyclical nature.', 'Considering the positive indicators in the U.S. economy, such as declining inflation and robust unemployment rates, coupled with the possibility of interest rate cuts later in the year, there’s a high likelihood of a resurgence in payment volumes. Meanwhile, international growth remains robust and is poised to contribute to Visa’s overall double-digit growth. Notably, Visa achieved a strong increase of 11% in total payment volume internationally.', 'The company also benefits from a strong tailwind in cross-border payments volumes driven by the thriving travel industry. Total cross-border volume witnessed a significant 16% year-over-year boost, with a remarkable 19% increase in cross-border travel-related spending.', 'While one might argue that this growth is a post-pandemic recovery phenomenon, the data suggests otherwise. The post-COVID recovery has already occurred, and the current figures indicate sustained high levels of spending on travel. Notably, back in Q4, Visa’s cross-border travel volume index reached 139% compared to 2019, and this trend continued into Q1, with the index increasing to 142%.', 'Visa’s management team seems to expect a rebound in revenue growth as well. For Fiscal 2024, it expects low double-digit revenue growth, suggesting a reacceleration, likely in the second half of the year.', 'Visa’s optimistic growth outlook and impressive free cash flow generation have empowered the company to buy back stock consistently, which is expected to bolster EPS growth in the mid-teens this year, as per management’s guidance.', 'As of the end of Q1, Visa’s Class A share count had decreased to 1.58 million, down 3% compared to the previous year. The synergy of sustained low double-digit revenue growth, coupled with the added impact of ongoing share repurchases on per-share metrics, is poised to propel EPS growth to approximately 13% based on Wall Street’s forecasts. Thus, EPS for the year is expected to land at $9.92.', 'My confidence in Visa’s performance goes beyond just meeting Wall Street’s estimates. I believe the company is positioned to surpass them. Even if reality ends up aligning with expectations, though, Fiscal 2024 promises to be another year characterized by outstanding double-digit growth, a testament to Visa’s enduring trend. This brings us to its valuation. Is the stock’s extended rally justified based on these estimates?', 'Visa stock has rallied by about 21% over the past year, reaching new all-time highs by the week lately. At its current levels, the stock’s P/E stands at about 27.9, which certainly implies a premium even for a company growing in the double-digits. Nevertheless, Visa stock has always been relatively expensive and is likely to continue to be so.', 'Investors value its one-of-a-kind moat inherent to its business model and the advantages of operating essentially in a duopoly with Mastercard. It’s not uncommon for Visa to trade at 25x+ EPS, as its double-digit bottom-line growth has always managed to catch up to these multiples eventually. Thus, I would consider Visa fairly valued, retaining the prospect of upside.', 'Regarding Wall Street’s view on the stock, Visa features a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $303.74, the average\xa0Visa stock price target implies 10.35% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell Visa stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW, boasting an average return of 20.77% per rating and a 100% success rate.', 'To sum up, while Visa’s recent Q1-2024 results revealed a temporary slowdown in revenue growth, it’s essential to contextualize this within the broader normalization of the company’s trajectory. What appears to be a consistent deceleration over the past 2.5 years aligns with the end of the post-pandemic surge in consumer spending (expansion) and subsequent rise in interest rates (contraction).', 'Despite the slight dip in Q1 in U.S. payment volumes, optimistic indicators in the U.S. economy and solid international growth position the company for a rebound in the latter half of 2024. With EPS growth set to hover again in the mid-teens, I remain bullish on Visa stock despite its seemingly hefty valuation.', 'Disclosure']"

Both companies are well-known brands, owning and operating payment networks that facilitate billions of credit card transactions around the world. Millions of people have a Visa or Mastercard logo in their pocket right now.', 'The similarities continue from an investment standpoint. Mastercard went public in mid-2006, with Visa following suit in early 2008. The stocks then went on a huge run, both rising roughly 2,000% in value.', 'There is little doubt that these companies run fantastic businesses -- just look at their historical returns. If you want to take advantage with your own investment, which stock should you buy today? The answer might surprise you.', 'The first thing to understand about Visa and Mastercard is that both owe their success to network effects. That is, the more people that use their services, the more valuable their businesses become.', 'While both businesses now offer ancillary services like cross-border transactions and risk-management solutions, the core moneymaker for them has always been consumer payments. Whenever you swipe, insert, or tap your credit card or enter its numbers -- whether it be at a physical store or online webpage -- there is an invisible process that plays out that ensures each party pays and gets paid accordingly. Very often it is Visa or Mastercard that takes on this role, keeping a small slice of the transaction price as a fee.', 'When it comes to market share, Visa and Mastercard dominate. In 2022, there were around 830 million general purpose credit cards in circulation in the United States. Visa was responsible for 385 million of those, with Mastercard contributing another 309 million. The next two card issuers on the list, Discover and American Express, were responsible for only 162 million combined.', 'There are two reasons for this market share dominance. First is the aforementioned power of network effects. Customers want to shop where their method of payment is accepted and merchants want to accept the method of payment most people have. This is called a two-sided marketplace, the dynamics of which often consolidate market share to only a few competitors.', ""The second reason Visa and Mastercard dominate the market is that both brands command trust. The networks of these companies rarely make mistakes. Their networks just work. This reality is backed by numbers. Visa, for example, facilitated $14.8 trillion worth of transactions in 2023.

Shares languished well below $40 for much of 2023, reaching a 52-week low of $30.14 last October.', 'But in recent months the stock has bounced back, hitting a 52-week high of $43.21 at the end of January. The share price dipped again recently, so is now the time to invest in Verizon?', ""Before deciding to buy, it's best to dig into where Verizon is currently at given the stock's roller-coaster year. This will help you gauge if Verizon is a worthwhile investment in 2024 and over the long term."", ""One reason Verizon stock struggled last year is the company's decline in 2023 revenue compared to 2022. For the full year, Verizon generated $134 billion in 2023 sales, a 2% decrease from the previous year."", ""A key factor in last year's revenue drop was three consecutive quarters of declines in postpaid phone subscriptions within Verizon's consumer division. Postpaid subscribers are the telecom industry's most valuable customers."", ""Consequently, Verizon's consumer segment saw 2023 sales drop 1.8% year over year to $101.6 billion. Its consumer division is essential to the company's success since it represented 76% of Verizon's 2023 revenue."", ""One bright spot, however, is Verizon's business segment. This division experienced several quarters of consistent postpaid phone net growth."", ""And in the fourth quarter, Verizon finally managed to reverse the trend in consumer postpaid phone net losses to achieve 318,000 net additions, leading to a share price boost after Q4 earnings were released. Not only is this an impressive turnaround from the rest of the year, it's a substantial jump from the the 41,000 net adds in the fourth quarter of 2022."", ""With Q4's impressive increase in consumer postpaid phone net adds, Verizon's wireless service revenue reached $19.4 billion for the quarter, growing 3.2% over the prior year. The company expects wireless service revenue to continue its growth in 2024, forecasting a year-over-year increase of at least 2%."", 'Verizon management attributed the turnaround in consumer postpaid phone subscriptions to the success of initiatives such as its myPlan program, which allows consumers to add a la carte features like streaming services to mobile phone plans.', ""Another contributing factor is Verizon's growth in internet services. The company's new 5G network is powerful enough to deliver wireless broadband to homes and businesses, what Verizon calls fixed wireless."", ""In locations where customers sign up for fixed wireless service, Verizon experienced an increase in mobile phone subscriptions as well. So fixed wireless internet is not only key to generating broadband revenue, it helps grow customers in Verizon's all-important consumer division."", ""And Verizon's broadband adoption is growing rapidly. Q4 represented the fifth consecutive quarter of over 400,000 net additions to its internet service, with 375,000 of those signing up for fixed wireless. This brought total subscribers to over three million as 2023 fixed wireless net adds rose 31% over 2022."", ""A further consideration when evaluating Verizon stock is the company's free cash flow (FCF). FCF indicates Verizon's ability to fund its high-yield dividend, currently over 6%. In 2023, FCF reached $18.7 billion, up from $14.1 billion in 2022."", ""Thanks to its FCF strength, Verizon increased its dividend for the 17th consecutive year last fall. That's the longest streak of dividend increases in the U.S. telecom industry, according to Verizon."", ""The company was able to wrap up 2023 on a strong note in part because of a change in executive leadership last March. Sowmyanarayan Sampath took over Verizon's consumer division after running the company's business segment. Since then, the gradual improvement in consumer postpaid net additions each quarter suggests these management changes benefited the company."", ""Combined with its rise in FCF and the continued strength expected in wireless service revenue, Verizon looks to be on the upswing entering this year. This makes Verizon stock a buy for 2024, and its high-yield dividend, combined with a long streak of increases, means you'll also collect passive income by holding on to this investment over the long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Verizon Communications wasn’t one of them.

This means its most heavily weighted component can become its least influential component overnight by performing a stock split.', ""At the moment, UnitedHealth Group is the Dow's most heavily weighted component with a share price north of $500. By market value, Apple is more than six times larger than UnitedHealth Group. In this price-weighted index, though, a 1% gain for the health insurer's stock price raises the Dow Jones Industrial Average's total value more than twice as far as an identical gain for Apple."", ""The Dow Jones Industrial Average has flaws, but it still deserves attention from income-seeking investors. That's because stocks aren't added to the index until they demonstrate an ability to generate profits on a recurring basis."", ""The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average offers an unappealing 1.9% dividend yield at recent prices. These two stocks offer considerably more. Here's why they look like smart stocks to buy now and hold for at least a decade."", ""Shares of Verizon (NYSE: VZ) offer a juicy 6.7% dividend yield at recent prices. Whenever you see a yield this high, it means investors are nervous about the company's ability to raise it further."", ""In Verizon's case, the market is worried about a debt load that rose to $150.7 billion at the end of 2023. This seems like a lot, but it's more manageable than it appears on the surface."", ""Verizon's debt load works out to about 2.6 times adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). This is on the high side, but Verizon has the means to steadily reduce its debt load and raise its dividend payout."", ""Verizon's investments in 5G spectrum are paying off with heaps of new fixed-wireless internet subscribers. The company reported 413,000 net-new broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was the fifth quarter in a row with over 400,000 net adds."", 'Verizon generated $18.7 billion in free cash flow last year but spent just $11.0 billion to meet its dividend commitment. With rising subscriber revenue from popular broadband services and significantly lower expectations for capital expenditures, steadily raising its dividend commitment through the coming decade seems likely.', ""Sales of innovative drugs many people literally can't live without have allowed Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) to raise its dividend payout an impressive 269% over the past decade. At recent prices, the stock offers a 3.1% yield that could rise several times over by the time you're ready to retire."", ""Amgen's been able to raise its payout at a blazing pace partly because Enbrel, an anti-inflammatory injection that's been around since 1998, still has patent-protected exclusivity in the U.S. market. A few years ago, Amgen was able to extend Enbrel's U.S. exclusivity into 2029."", ""Of course, Enbrel isn't the only patent-protected drug that Amgen successfully markets. In 2023, it reported record sales for 18 different brands."", 'These days, Amgen investors are enthusiastic about an experimental weight-loss drug tentatively named maridebart cafraglutide that could drive blockbuster sales down the road. Amgen recently announced encouraging results from a placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial. Top-line results from a larger phase 2 study should be ready by the end of 2024.', ""Shares of Amgen have been trading for 15 times forward-earnings expectations. At this reasonable valuation, investors could still realize market-beating gains over the long run even if Amgen's weight-loss candidate fizzles out this year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of high dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks in the Dow.\xa0', 'Dividend yield holds significant importance in dividend investing, serving as a key metric for investors. Experts often recommend prioritizing companies that demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payouts over time. Nevertheless, there is also notable interest among investors in companies offering high dividend yields. Over time, high-yielding stocks and companies with consistent dividend growth have demonstrated comparable performance, showing a close race in their investment returns. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series employs a distinctive methodology aimed at tracking the performance of 100 stocks with high dividend yields across various markets. These stocks are chosen based on their consistent history of dividend payments and strong fundamental metrics. Over the long term, this index has demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains compared to standard benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index achieved an annualized total return of 11.7%, surpassing its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which yielded 10.2% annually. Similarly, in the international market, the Dow Jones International Dividend 100 Index outperformed its benchmark, the S&P Global Ex-U.S. LargeMidCap, in both price return and total return over the past 15 years.', 'Heartland Advisors conducted an in-depth analysis utilizing data provided by Kenneth French, sourced from the US Stock Database Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. This dataset encompassed all equity securities listed on major US exchanges, including NYSE, Amex, NASDAQ, and NYSE Arca, spanning from 1928 through 2017. The study focused on examining monthly and annual value-weighted total returns of non-dividend-paying U.S. stocks and five portfolios consisting of dividend-paying stocks. These portfolios were constructed based on dividend yields. The research tracked the performance of each portfolio from January 1928 to December 2017, with dividends reinvested. Notably, the findings revealed that all portfolios comprising dividend-paying stocks outperformed the portfolio comprised solely of non-dividend-paying stocks over the entire period studied. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, in general, portfolios with higher dividend yields tended to outperform those with lower dividend yields. This suggests a positive correlation between dividend yield and investment performance, with higher-yielding quintiles demonstrating stronger returns compared to lower-yielding quintiles.', ""The impressive performance of high-yielding dividend stocks has garnered significant popularity among investors, leading many to turn to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a key source for such investment opportunities. Employing a strategy known as the 'Dogs of the Dow', investors focus on acquiring the highest-yielding stocks within the DJIA. The outcomes of this strategy have been varied and inconsistent over time. According to data sourced from Barron's in one of our articles, over a 20-year period ending in 2023, the Dogs of the Dow strategy yielded an average annual return slightly above 8%, inclusive of dividends. This performance lags behind the S&P 500 by a little over 1% annually. However, when assessing the period from the end of 2003 to 2018, the Dogs of the Dow were actually outperforming the S&P 500 by approximately 1% each year."", 'Verizon Communications Inc.

The advertising market is recovering, and the social media king is riding the wave to hefty profits.', 'CEO Mark Zuckerberg deemed 2023 Meta\'s ""year of efficiency."" The parent company of Facebook and Instagram went through the painful process of shedding costs via job cuts and other much-needed expense reduction initiatives. Those efforts are now bearing fruit. Meta\'s sales climbed 16% to $135 billion in 2023, while its net income surged 69% to $39 billion.', ""Better still, the company's growth is accelerating. Revenue and net profit jumped 25% and 201%, respectively, year over year to $40 billion and $14 billion in the fourth quarter."", ""Meta's aggressive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) are strengthening its ad-targeting capabilities. At the same time, its massive user base continues to expand. Nearly 3.2 billion people use one of the company's apps every day. That's up 8% compared to the prior-year period."", ""As a nod to its soaring profits, Meta said it would pay its first-ever dividend. Its initial quarterly cash payment will be a relatively meager $0.50 per share, but it's likely to grow quickly along with the company's earnings."", ""To further reward shareholders, Meta announced plans to repurchase an additional $50 billion worth of its stock. Buy shares today, and you can position yourself to benefit from this AI-powered advertising leader's colossal new capital return program."", 'Like Meta, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is on an epic bull run. The semiconductor juggernaut designs the cutting-edge chips that power the most advanced AI applications, and business is booming.', ""Tech titans like Microsoft and Tesla are stocking up on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to run their AI models and related services in their cloud computing facilities. In turn, Nvidia's data center revenue surged a staggering 279% year over year to $14.5 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 29."", ""Yet some investors are concerned about mounting competition. Several of Nvidia's major customers are developing their own chip designs. But the chipmaker is meeting this challenge head-on. Nvidia is reportedly offering custom chip design services to leading cloud computing, automotive, wireless, and video game companies, according to Reuters. If it's successful in courting some of these large chip buyers, Nvidia could transform a potential threat into an opportunity. Analysts at investment bank Needham peg the market for custom chips at approximately $30 billion."", 'Nvidia also intends to compete aggressively in the burgeoning market for chips that can run AI-powered apps directly on laptops and other mobile devices.

It has already proven its ability to complete some tasks in a fraction of the time that humans can, from summarizing lengthy documents to writing computer code in a matter of seconds. Depending which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, it could add anywhere from $7 trillion to $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade.', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the poster child of the AI revolution because its data center chips have been critical to the development, training, and deployment of almost every significant AI model to date. Surging data center revenue has catapulted the company to a market capitalization of almost $1.8 trillion -- and $1 trillion of that value has been added in the past 12 months alone.', ""There is still scope for upside in Nvidia stock, especially if Wall Street's AI forecasts prove accurate. But I'm going to explain why Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and C3.ai (NYSE: AI) are better value AI plays right now."", ""Oracle was founded in 1977, and its early success came from its database management software. Today, it's one of the largest providers of cloud computing services under its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment, which operates 66 data centers around the world."", ""But each of those 66 data centers is now being expanded, and Oracle is building 100 more. Why? Because the company is experiencing such a significant surge in demand for AI infrastructure that it simply can't keep up. CTO Larry Ellison says Oracle's Nvidia graphics processor (GPU) cluster technology is the most advanced in the industry, offering developers the ability to train AI models at twice the speed and half the cost of its competitors."", ""Oracle's latest data centers are called Gen2 Cloud, and automation is at their core. Ellison says there is no cost difference between managing 10 data centers and 100 data centers (from an operational standpoint), which translates to savings for customers. In fact, Gen2 Cloud has attracted leading generative AI start-ups like Cohere, Adept AI, and even Elon Musk's xAI, and they have already committed to spending billions of dollars on Gen2 capacity."", ""In the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30, 2023), the OCI segment delivered $1.6 billion in revenue, a 52% year-over-year increase. That blew away the 5% growth rate of Oracle's business overall. Even though OCI only accounts for 12% of the company's total revenue, Ellison believes it will maintain its 50% growth rate for years to come, so it could soon become the centerpiece of the Oracle story."", ""Oracle has generated $3.62 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, and based on its current stock price of $116.64, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.2. That is marginally more expensive than the 31.7 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 Technology Index, but it's substantially cheaper than the 58.5 P/E ratio of Nvidia."", 'Ironically, one of the things stopping Oracle from completing its new data center projects more quickly is Nvidia, which is suffering from a supply constraint for its popular chips. Once that hurdle is overcome, Oracle could be set for substantial long-term growth from all of that new industry-leading infrastructure.', ""C3.ai is valued at just $3.4 billion, so it's tiny compared to Nvidia, but its contribution to AI has been significant. The company was founded in 2009, and it was the first provider of enterprise AI services -- in other words, C3.ai was the first company to develop ready-made, customizable AI applications for businesses, so they could use the technology to supercharge their operations."", 'Today, C3.ai offers more than 40 applications suitable for organizations in at least 10 different industries. Retailers, for example, can use C3.ai to boost transaction volume and minimize supply chain costs by allowing AI to generate predictive insights based on customer and transaction data. Similarly, banks can use C3.ai as the ultimate fraud-fighting tool -- one customer saw a whopping 200% increase in the number of suspicious activity cases identified after adopting C3.ai, which were previously going unnoticed.', 'C3.ai had 404 customer engagements during the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Oct. 31, 2023), which was an 81% year-over-year increase. That growth rate marked an acceleration over the previous two quarters, which highlights how quickly demand for AI software is scaling in the corporate world.', ""C3.ai is still focusing on growth, so it isn't a profitable company just yet. Its revenue increased by 17% in Q2, the fastest pace in more than a year. C3.ai is transitioning away from a subscription-based revenue model and toward a consumption-based model instead. This will eliminate lengthy contract negotiations and allow customers to sign up more quickly, which is great in the long run."", 'Management knew the transition would lead to a temporary slowdown in revenue growth, but the worst appears to be over, and a reacceleration is clearly underway.', ""C3.ai stock soared 156% in 2023, but it's still trading 82% below its all-time high set during the tech frenzy in 2020. Investors assigned an irrational valuation to the company back then, but the steep drop is now an enticing opportunity."", ""Based on C3.ai's $284.7 million in trailing-12-month revenue and its current market cap of $3.4 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11.9. That makes it substantially cheaper than Nvidia, which trades at a P/S ratio of 30.1. Nvidia is growing its revenue far more quickly, so its stock deserves to trade at a premium, but it's unlikely that will last forever."", ""C3.ai's business, however, is on the upswing, and it can be bought at a steep discount to its best-ever level. That might be the better long-term play."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

Amid a broader market sell-off, Arm shares tumbled nearly 20% on Tuesday.', 'And while investors are buying the potential benefits, Wall Street is a bit more cautious on how the disruptive technology fully contributes to earnings growth for Arm moving forward.', 'Needham & Company analyst Charles Shi told Yahoo Finance Live that the firm isn\'t even sure Arm is that much of an AI play, with its current exposure to generative AI ""quite small.""', '""It remains to be seen whether they can actually benefit from generative AI going into the future,"" Shi said.', 'This has become a prevailing theme among other popular AI trades like C3.ai (AI) and Palantir (PLTR). Wall Street wants to see further actual results and investors just want to hear more AI mentions.', ""As Shi pointed out, a company with even the slightest sprinkle of generative AI sends investors into a frenzy and valuations sky-high. Additionally, some Wall Street analysts have also noted that since only around 10% of Arm's outstanding shares are publicly traded — the rest is controlled by SoftBank — volatility in the name is to be expected."", 'And this also underscores the fact that investors may only have a vague idea what these companies even do. Arm, for its part, is on the ground floor of technological developments as it produces instruction sets to help chips like those made by Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and just about every other major industry player operate.', 'But the Arm stock story remains largely a sign that investors are still following a familiar playbook for the AI trade — a company surprises Wall Street expectations for future revenues and attributes this beat to the disruptive technology.', 'The playbook goes back to last May, when Nvidia issued revenue guidance that topped Street expectations by about 53%.', ""And since then, investors have simply lowered the bar on what level of AI promise they're willing to pay up for."", ""For instance, Arm projected revenue in the current quarter to hit $850 million to $900 million, 16% above Wall Street's estimates for $778 million.

While tech stocks seemed to take the spotlight last year, it doesn’t necessarily indicate the downfall of dividend stocks, which have long held their allure. As we progress through 2024, the stock and bond market outlook fluctuates regularly, influenced by economic updates, statements from the Federal Reserve, and shifts in interest rate expectations. Initially, investors anticipated multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, with expectations of the first cut in March. However, following a series of positive economic indicators, the Fed has hinted that a rate cut in March is improbable. Consequently, investors are adjusting their valuations of stocks and bonds, awaiting fewer rate cuts to commence later than previously projected. During uncertain times, it's recommended for investors to focus on dividend stocks. These stocks typically offer good value and can provide consistent income, especially in sectors where there's potential for growth in stock prices."", ""Analysts' preference for dividend stocks isn't a recent trend; it's largely based on the historical performance of these stocks. Companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time have proven to be reliable investments, delivering strong returns in the past. These stocks have been particularly resilient during periods of high inflation. For instance, the S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index, which tracks companies in the S&P 500 known for consistent or increasing dividends and high forecast dividend yield growth, saw its dividends grow at an annual rate of 13.8% from 2010 to 2022, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices. This growth rate has surpassed the long-term U.S. inflation rate, even amidst recent spikes in inflation over the past few years. The report also noted that historical data comparing the performance of the S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index to the S&P 500 indicated that the index has displayed somewhat defensive traits, with a downside capture ratio of 94.5%. Additionally, over time, the index has typically captured 96% of the market's returns during upward market trends."", 'As previously mentioned, dividend stocks took a backseat during the tech surge in 2023, but reliable dividend-paying companies are poised for a strong resurgence. Analysts express optimism that investors will acknowledge the strength of these stocks this year.

With its $10.5 billion acquisition of financial software provider Adenza from Thoma Bravo in November, the company signaled its ambitions to become the ""trusted fabric of the world\'s financial ecosystem,"" as Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman put it.', ""However, due to the $6 billion in long-term debt it took on to fund that purchase, the market has taken a cautious view toward Nasdaq's stock, and it remains below its pre-acquisition announcement price. Nevertheless, despite having over $10 billion in total long-term debt on its books now, Nasdaq's new growth story and immense cash-generating capabilities leave the company's future looking incredibly bright."", ""Here's how Nasdaq could make this acquisition work and why it looks well positioned to extend its market-beating run of the last two decades."", 'Following its massive Adenza deal, Nasdaq restructured its operations into three business segments:', 'Capital access platforms (41% of sales in Q4), comprised of the following units: data and listing services (IPOs), index (exchange-traded products tied to Nasdaq), and workflows and insights (analytics for asset managers and various corporate services). Nasdaq has been the listing leader for new IPOs for the last five years.', ""Financial technology (36% of sales, including Adenza in Q4): Consisting of two units -- regulatory technology and capital markets technology -- this is where the Adenza acquisition fits in. Regulatory technology comprises AxiomSL (half of the Adenza purchase) and Verafin. Together, these groups cover areas like risk data management, regulatory reporting solutions, fraud and anti-money laundering, and surveillance for banks, insurers, and asset managers.

In addition to this stability, Nasdaq's new financial technology unit represents a new growth area for the company as it looks to patrol the financial markets, creating a safe, modern, transparent, and equitable environment for all involved."", ""According to a forecast by Grand View Research, spending on fraud prevention and anti-money laundering will grow at a compound annual rate of almost 16% through 2030. In that expanding market, Nasdaq's regulatory technology should play an essential role in combatting crime in the financial ecosystem for decades. Meanwhile, researchers at Future Market Insights anticipate that the regulatory reporting niche will grow at an annualized rate of 15% through 2033, as banks will be required to adhere to ever more stringent regulations over time. Nasdaq's solutions in that space could prove essential."", ""Showcasing the value seen in Nasdaq's up-and-coming unit, Adenza signed two central banks to deals in Q4, while Verafin added its first three Tier 1 banks as clients in 2023. With Nasdaq's inaugural Global Financial Crime report showing an estimated $3 trillion of illicit funds flowing through the financial ecosystem, the company's big bet on Adenza could pay huge dividends down the road."", ""While Nasdaq's $10 billion debt load may seem excessive compared to its market capitalization of $32 billion, its immense free-cash-flow (FCF) generation and FCF margin of 27% add a valuable layer of security."", 'Best yet for investors, its already-impressive FCF margin should only grow stronger as it integrates its acquisition. Adenza generated an impressive $306 million of pre-tax cash flows from $583 million in revenue during 2023 -- and those metrics could rise further as its new position as part of Nasdaq provides greater cross-selling opportunities.', ""Armed with this growing FCF creation, management aims to lower Nasdaq's debt load from 4.3 times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) to 3.3 times within three years."", ""Despite that debt paydown plan, Nasdaq should easily be able to increase its dividend in 2024 for the 12th consecutive year -- its current payout (which offers a 1.5% dividend yield) only uses 25% of the company's FCF. Nasdaq has grown these payments at an annualized rate of 20% across the last decade, handsomely rewarding shareholders who have stayed with it over the long run."", ""Buoyed by this dividend, powerful FCF generation, and a long growth runway ahead in its niche of helping protect and regulate the financial markets, Nasdaq's stock looks promising at 18 times FCF -- even with its temporarily higher (but safe) debt balance."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nasdaq right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nasdaq, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nasdaq wasn’t one of them.

The consumer has been pretty resilient.', ""They've stuck to their brands and they are looking for value, but continue to look for growth, both in terms of price and mix.

As we're starting to-- and as Rochelle was mentioning, some of the reports that came through this morning really kind of giving us a sense of where these companies are continuing to push price through versus where they're just trying to make sure that they're maintaining market share."", ""OLIVIA TONG: Sure. I think quite frankly, we like the multinationals or the domestics. We went into the year thinking that. And you're seeing that play out. Colgate grew faster than P&G this quarter. Coke over Pepsi."", 'Now that said, the other area that we do like is companies that cater to either the tail end-- either tail end of the income spectrum versus in the middle. So you think about a company like e.l.f., for example, in beauty. Their average price points are in the $6 to $7 range.', ""They grew sales 85% in the quarter. So you're really seeing consumers look for value at both ends of the spectrum. Either if they're willing to pay a premium, they want some value add associated with that or a fairly low price point and, quite frankly, value associated with that as well."", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: So Olivia, in terms of your top pick in staples and discretionary here, what are the standouts and why?', 'OLIVIA TONG: Sure. We do like Colgate. We do like Procter. And we do like e.l.f., as I mentioned earlier. With respect to Colgate and Procter, we think that they will continue to grow faster than their peer set. Colgate, in particular, has a lot of international exposure, 80 plus percent international exposure.', 'So as you see disproportionate amount of pricing, Colgate will benefit from that. Whereas P&G, as sort of your steady Eddie, continue to grow price and mix. Very strong in terms of innovation and very strong gross margin and operating margin improvement.', ""And quite frankly, the gross margin has been so strong that they've been able to spend a lot of that back in terms of advertising and other brand support.

We think there's a lot of white space opportunity there with respect to shelf space, international, different retailers as well."", ""And they've been gaining shelf space and they continue to gain shelf space across a number of categories.

303,3109c59e-c85d-365d-b63d-e720901729cf,DVN,2024-02-14,"If You Like Devon Energy, Then You'll Love These High-Yield Oil Stocks",Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3109c59e-c85d-365d-b63d-e720901729cf/if-you-like-devon-energy%2C.html,1707910200,STORY,"['DVN', 'COP', '^GSPC', 'HESM']","[""While the broader market continues to roar higher, the energy sector has taken a breather. In fact, it's down 4.1% over the last year despite a 20% gain in the S&P 500."", ""As oil and gas companies report their Q4 and full-year 2023 earnings, it's becoming increasingly clear that the industry is fundamentally sound and a great value now."", ""Here's why Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), and Hess Midstream (NYSE: HESM) are three high-yield dividend stocks worth buying."", ""Lee Samaha (Devon Energy): Yes, the price of oil has declined from almost $94 a barrel in late September to around $75.5 at the time of writing. And yes, weaker oil demand and strong oil production have led to rising oil inventories (which are usually bearish for the price of oil). Therefore, it's unsurprising that oil stocks have fallen since late September, including Devon Energy, down 12% since the end of September."", ""Still, there's a need for some perspective here. The economy is passing through a weak period with the brakes put on by central bankers keen to subdue inflation. Yet the price of oil is significantly above where it's been in previous slowdowns -- the grey sections in the chart below indicate recessions."", 'In addition, the price of oil is still at a level whereby Devon Energy can pay investors a hefty dividend. For example, on its third-quarter earnings call in early November, management gave a range of outcomes for its free-cash-flow (FCF) yield based on the price of oil and its share price on Nov. 3 (the stock closed at $47.34 on that day).', ""Based on a price of oil of $70 and a share price of $47.34, management predicts an FCF yield of 8% for 2024, implying an FCF per share of $3.79. Now, let's estimate what that might mean for Devon's dividend. The company pays a fixed dividend of $0.20 and a variable dividend of up to 50% of the excess FCF after the fixed dividend is paid."", 'The share price is now about $42. In this model, after the $0.20 fixed dividend is paid, Devon will have $3.59 per share in excess FCF, and 50% of that, the variable dividend, is about $1.80. Adding the fixed dividend of $0.20 to the variable dividend of $1.80 gives $2, provided that the current stock price is $42, equating to a dividend yield of nearly 4.8% for a price of oil of $70 a barrel in 2024. That would be fine for many income-seeking investors.', 'Daniel Foelber (ConocoPhillips): 2023 was a great year for ConocoPhillips. The company earned $9.06 in diluted earnings per share (EPS), not quite as good as 2022 but still the second-best year of earnings since 2005. One reason for the strong year was higher production volumes.', ""ConocoPhillips achieved record production of 1.826 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). In 2024, the midpoint of its guidance calls for a 5.7% increase to 1.93 million boe/d. ConocoPhillips didn't give a specific revenue or earnings target, but it did provide some information."", ""It expects 2024 full-year capital expenditures to be $11.25 billion at the midpoint -- nearly identical to 2023. It forecasts full-year operating costs of $9 billion at the midpoint, higher than 2023 but not by much. Add it all up, and we should expect similar cash flows and earnings in 2024 as long as oil prices are around the same. That rarely happens, so let's assume WTI averages $70 this year, or over 10% less than the 2023 maker price."", 'ConocoPhillips is unique because it conveniently supplies its cash flow sensitives based on the oil price. For 2024, it estimates a $120 million to $130 million change for every $1 change in WTI between $60 and $90 a barrel. So a 10% year-over-year drop in average oil prices would be close to $1 billion less in cash flow. It sounds like a lot, but ConocoPhillips generated a whopping $10.1 billion in FCF, which goes to show its margin of error in combating lower oil prices.', 'ConocoPhillips primarily used that FCF to pay $5.6 billion in ordinary and variable dividends and repurchase $5.4 billion in stock. If oil prices fall, ConocoPhillips would probably just pull back a little on its capital return program. In fact, its guidance assumes just that, as ConocoPhillips is forecasting $9 billion in capital returns in 2024 compared to $11 billion last year. In other words, it wants to make sure it can support its capital return program with cash.', ""Like Devon Energy, estimating ConocoPhillips' exact dividend payout in 2024 is tricky because of the variable dividend. But given what we know from last year and the guidance in the Q4 earnings release, investors should expect a forward yield of around 3.5% to 4.5% from ConocoPhillips."", ""ConocoPhillips is generating a ton of cash, will keep generating a ton of cash even if oil prices fall, and has significant upside potential if oil prices rise, both in its performance and through the dividend. All told, it's a top exploration and production stock to buy in 2024."", ""Scott Levine (Hess Midstream): It's no wonder that income investors are attracted to Devon thanks to its generous dividend. But it's not the only high-yield energy stock in town. Operating in the Bakken shale and Three Forks formation in the Williston Basin, Hess Midstream is another option for those looking to supplement their passive income streams with a stock found in the oil patch. The midstream company's dividend is especially appealing right now, offering a forward dividend yield of 7.8%."", 'Part of the allure of Hess Midstream is that it inks long-term commercial contracts with customers. This affords management great insight into future cash flows. With this visibility into its potential future financials, management can plan accordingly to allocate capital responsibly. In 2024, for example, Hess Midstream projects oil and gas throughput volumes will rise about 10% compared to 2023, and it further expects annualized growth in gas throughput volumes of approximately 10% from 2024 through 2026.

If you want to skip our overview of the global energy industry and some latest events, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds. ', 'Despite the fact that it is one of the more mature industries in the world, the global energy industry remains as dynamic as ever. Every day investors, analysts, government officials, and members of the press painstakingly go over developments in the energy industry to see if they will have any implications on the global business and economic environments. After all, energy, which constitutes primarily of petroleum products and fuels, is the backbone of the modern day world and without it life as we know would come to a standstill.', ""This also makes energy stocks quite lucrative when it comes to both share price growth and stability. The general trend on the stock market sees sizeable firms primarily preferred for their safety and stoutness since their markets are not as risky as those for other firms, particularly those that belong to high growth sectors such as technology. While this naturally benefits energy stocks, at the same time, should the cards align, then energy stocks can deliver spectacular returns that are furthered and sweetened by juicy dividends due to the billions of dollars in profit that they make each year. If you're wondering which energy stocks are the most profitable and make the most money, wonder no more and take a look at 12 Most Profitable Energy Stocks."", 'As an illustration, consider the largest publicly traded energy companies by revenue. The three largest energy stocks in terms of revenue that trade on NYSE are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL), and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). The most significant year for the global energy industry in recent times was 2022, and it came just a year after energy stocks nosedived as global demand for their products faltered in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The Russian invasion of Ukraine upended the industry as European nations scuttled to find alternative fuel supplies. This saw Exxon, Shell, and Total report record revenues, and their shares jumped in double digit percentages during the early days of the war.', ""Since then, the global energy market has stabilized and energy stocks have come back to earth. Their revenues have returned to 'normal' readings after a bumper 2022, and in 2024, the outlook for the global energy industry has divided the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The IEA's first energy outlook report issued in January 2024 outlined that the agency believes that one of the biggest risks to the global oil industry lies in the escalation of the crisis in the Middle East. What initially started as a devastating attack by Hamas on Israel has now spiralled into a broader low intensity conflict involving the Houthi rebel group attacking global shipping lines and a coalition led by the United States and Great Britain responding by military action. Things came to a head just as the year started after an attack led to U.S. service member deaths and left the world in jitters for a while as it contemplated how the world's most powerful country would respond."", ""On the other hand, OPEC released an unprecedented report that not only remained optimistic but also attempted to stabilize oil prices. The optimism wasn't unprecedented with the body sharing that it expects non OPEC liquids production to grow this year. It also released an oil industry forecast for 2025, a rare announcement that saw OPEC share a 12 month+ forecast for its industry. This was done to make sure speculators wouldn't be able to inject volatility into oil prices, an occurrence that the Saudis believe was responsible for recent weakness in the oil market. OPEC expects that global oil demand will grow by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2025, bolstered by an economic recovery in China."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top energy stocks according to hedge funds, with the notable picks being Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)."", ""A pipeline snaking through a desert canyon, representing a energy's transport infrastructure."", 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the best energy stocks, we ranked the 40 most valuable energy stocks that traded on NYSE and the NASDAQ by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares as of Q3 2023.

It has already proven its ability to complete some tasks in a fraction of the time that humans can, from summarizing lengthy documents to writing computer code in a matter of seconds. Depending which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, it could add anywhere from $7 trillion to $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade.', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the poster child of the AI revolution because its data center chips have been critical to the development, training, and deployment of almost every significant AI model to date. Surging data center revenue has catapulted the company to a market capitalization of almost $1.8 trillion -- and $1 trillion of that value has been added in the past 12 months alone.', ""There is still scope for upside in Nvidia stock, especially if Wall Street's AI forecasts prove accurate. But I'm going to explain why Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and C3.ai (NYSE: AI) are better value AI plays right now."", ""Oracle was founded in 1977, and its early success came from its database management software. Today, it's one of the largest providers of cloud computing services under its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment, which operates 66 data centers around the world."", ""But each of those 66 data centers is now being expanded, and Oracle is building 100 more. Why? Because the company is experiencing such a significant surge in demand for AI infrastructure that it simply can't keep up. CTO Larry Ellison says Oracle's Nvidia graphics processor (GPU) cluster technology is the most advanced in the industry, offering developers the ability to train AI models at twice the speed and half the cost of its competitors."", ""Oracle's latest data centers are called Gen2 Cloud, and automation is at their core. Ellison says there is no cost difference between managing 10 data centers and 100 data centers (from an operational standpoint), which translates to savings for customers. In fact, Gen2 Cloud has attracted leading generative AI start-ups like Cohere, Adept AI, and even Elon Musk's xAI, and they have already committed to spending billions of dollars on Gen2 capacity."", ""In the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30, 2023), the OCI segment delivered $1.6 billion in revenue, a 52% year-over-year increase. That blew away the 5% growth rate of Oracle's business overall. Even though OCI only accounts for 12% of the company's total revenue, Ellison believes it will maintain its 50% growth rate for years to come, so it could soon become the centerpiece of the Oracle story."", ""Oracle has generated $3.62 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, and based on its current stock price of $116.64, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.2. That is marginally more expensive than the 31.7 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 Technology Index, but it's substantially cheaper than the 58.5 P/E ratio of Nvidia."", 'Ironically, one of the things stopping Oracle from completing its new data center projects more quickly is Nvidia, which is suffering from a supply constraint for its popular chips. Once that hurdle is overcome, Oracle could be set for substantial long-term growth from all of that new industry-leading infrastructure.', ""C3.ai is valued at just $3.4 billion, so it's tiny compared to Nvidia, but its contribution to AI has been significant. The company was founded in 2009, and it was the first provider of enterprise AI services -- in other words, C3.ai was the first company to develop ready-made, customizable AI applications for businesses, so they could use the technology to supercharge their operations."", 'Today, C3.ai offers more than 40 applications suitable for organizations in at least 10 different industries. Retailers, for example, can use C3.ai to boost transaction volume and minimize supply chain costs by allowing AI to generate predictive insights based on customer and transaction data. Similarly, banks can use C3.ai as the ultimate fraud-fighting tool -- one customer saw a whopping 200% increase in the number of suspicious activity cases identified after adopting C3.ai, which were previously going unnoticed.', 'C3.ai had 404 customer engagements during the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Oct. 31, 2023), which was an 81% year-over-year increase. That growth rate marked an acceleration over the previous two quarters, which highlights how quickly demand for AI software is scaling in the corporate world.', ""C3.ai is still focusing on growth, so it isn't a profitable company just yet. Its revenue increased by 17% in Q2, the fastest pace in more than a year. C3.ai is transitioning away from a subscription-based revenue model and toward a consumption-based model instead. This will eliminate lengthy contract negotiations and allow customers to sign up more quickly, which is great in the long run."", 'Management knew the transition would lead to a temporary slowdown in revenue growth, but the worst appears to be over, and a reacceleration is clearly underway.', ""C3.ai stock soared 156% in 2023, but it's still trading 82% below its all-time high set during the tech frenzy in 2020. Investors assigned an irrational valuation to the company back then, but the steep drop is now an enticing opportunity."", ""Based on C3.ai's $284.7 million in trailing-12-month revenue and its current market cap of $3.4 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11.9. That makes it substantially cheaper than Nvidia, which trades at a P/S ratio of 30.1. Nvidia is growing its revenue far more quickly, so its stock deserves to trade at a premium, but it's unlikely that will last forever."", ""C3.ai's business, however, is on the upswing, and it can be bought at a steep discount to its best-ever level. That might be the better long-term play."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

Chris?"", 'Christian Cocks', ""Thanks, [Karan] and good morning, everyone. For more than a year now, you've heard me outline Hasbro's strategy to refocus on play behind the philosophy of fewer, bigger, better. Fewer SKUs that drive higher impact, bigger investment behind winning brands and more focused categories and better innovation, driven by a renewed leadership team and a focus on kids, parents and fans, our consumers, the lifeblood of Hasbro. We laid out a blueprint for a more focused and profitable company with a number of growth initiatives built on a diverse portfolio of some of the most iconic brands in the toy and game industry. While business transformations take time, I'm pleased with how much we accomplished in 2023. Setting the table for a 2024 punctuated by strong profit growth and momentum in renewing Hasbro's innovation engine. We're entering 2024 with a healthier balance sheet. A leaner cost structure and an operational rigor that will maintain and build on these improvements in the quarters ahead. In 2023, we took substantial action to bolster our balance sheet. At the end of the year, we closed our deal with Lionsgate on eOne Film and TV, allowing us to focus our investments on higher return, play-focused initiatives, across toys, games and digital. Proceeds from the deal allowed us to reduce our debt by approximately $400 million. As we shift our entertainment strategy to an asset-light and partner-led model, we took a $1 billion impairment. A noncash item in Q4, which reflects the sale of eOne and a change in outlook for the balance of our owned and operated production efforts. This shift frees up more capital for us to reinvest in toys, games and particularly our digital future. Between hard work from our sales and operations teams and some of the financial actions we took at the end of the quarter, we entered 2024 with inventories down over 50% year-over-year which is well below 2019 levels. We also took steps to improve our structural profitability, exiting a number of low or negative profit businesses that we have shifted to a licensed out model. Finally, we are driving better-than-expected cost savings through our operational excellence work, unlocking crucial investment capacity as we seek to connect with fans of all ages and across all play patterns. Previously, we communicated $350 million to $400 million in annual run rate savings. We're updating our target to $750 million of gross savings by the end of 2025 with half of it dropping to the bottom line. This allows us to reinvest in our business, meaningfully improve our cash flows and return cash to our shareholders, which we are committed to continuing through our category-leading dividend. Since I became CEO in 2022, Hasbro has returned almost $1 billion to shareholders and paid down over $0.5 billion in debt. While 2023 was challenging, and we still expect the toy industry to face near-term headwinds, we believe we're taking the necessary steps to turn around our consumer products business. Wizards and Digital Gaming is coming off a banner year, led by MAGIC's Universes Beyond, the success of Baldur's Gate 3 from our partners of Larian and MONOPOLY GO! From Scopely.2024 is about returning consumer products to profitability, investing for long-term momentum in games and driving significant improvements in Hasbro's bottom line fueled by operational discipline and renewed product innovation. In short, we're putting all the right pieces together to keep investing in our growth initiatives while expanding the ways our franchises reach bands through digital games. We expect the next year we'll likely see continued headwinds in the toy category. We're exiting 2023 with our retail inventory down around 20%. While we think Hasbro's retail inventory is in a healthy position across the industry, a lot of older discounted inventory still remains in the market. The consumer remains value conscious and we anticipate entertainment will be less of a tailwind in the year ahead behind a reduced box office slate. Anticipating these headwinds, we made necessary choices to get our cost structure and inventory positions healthy. Accelerating a number of cost savings initiatives by several quarters. Since I became CEO, we have significantly enhanced our consumer insights capabilities and upgraded our design and toy leadership. In 2024, we'll see more and more of the resulting innovation improvements as these capability upgrades come to market across our portfolio. As such, we believe we're in a good position to at least pace the industry this year with innovation and share trends accelerating to ahead of market as we head into 2025. Turning around the product pipeline is key with the right people and the right insights. At the end of the day, it's all about great product. In the back half of 2023, we started to see the first evidence of our new team and products working. Take FURBY, for example. This was a product we took our time testing and iterating based on consumer insights. It paid off as FURBY was one of the top new toy introductions in 2023. We continued the FURBY craze in December with the launch of Furblet, another hit introduction, and we're excited to continue building this franchise in 2024. 2023 was also a strong year for our TRANSFORMERS franchise on the back of the hit movie Transformers: Rise of the Beasts from our partners in Paramount, driving point-of-sale growth of 35%. We have some exciting activations planned as we celebrate the brand's 40th anniversary in 2024 as well as the star-studded animated movie Transformers 1 coming this summer along with fresh merchandise. This year also marks PEPPA PIG's 20th birthday. We'll be celebrating with new innovative products and an entertainment special featuring A-list talent, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom. After gaining share in the arts and crafts category in 2023, with another strong year, including our ultimate ice cream truck, the PLAY-DOH team continues to innovate, expect more creative surprises and new cross-brand collaborations in the year ahead. In action figures, we are leaning into our category-leading collaboration with The Walt Disney Company for their Marvel Super Heroes assemble marketing campaign, featuring new price points and products across our lines including all new preschool fun with Spidey and His Amazing Friends. For Star Wars, we're excited to expand our best-selling Lightsaber Forge Kyber Core series and introduce our new 799 Epic series 4-inch action figures. We saw an incredibly strong launch from BEYBLADE X last year in Japan from our partners at Takara Tomy and are eagerly anticipating the U.S. launch this summer. What we believe will be one of the hottest new toys in 2024. It's an exciting product that we think long-time collectors and kids fresh to the franchise will be thrilled with. The Blaster category continues to be under pressure, but we also continue to believe this is a strong and enduring play pattern for fans of all ages. This year, we'll be introducing new innovation into the category, featuring a new performance start technology, pop off-the-shelf design and attractive pricing up and down the range. Board games continues to be a leading category for us and one we anticipate will grow in the year ahead. Twister Air was the number one new game across the G10 markets in 2023, according to Circana, thanks to an innovative new augmented reality experience. You're going to see a renewed focus on expanding genres, leveraging our reach and distribution strength to introduce more cool new games than ever and working with some of the brightest designers in the industry to give their games a platform they deserve. Whether it's adult party games, family card games, casual strategy or extending mega hits like MONOPOLY, 2024 will be a big year for gaming from Hasbro. Speaking of games, Wizards and Digital outperformed our guidance in 2023, driven by a series of blockbuster hits. MAGIC had another record year in '23 with a string of amazing new sets including our best-selling set of all time, the Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth. While a product like Lord to the Rings creates a tough comp in 2024, we have some unique sets that fans are eagerly anticipating. Including March's Fallout, a new Commander focused Universes Beyond product line. This summer's Modern Horizon 3, the sequel to our prior best-selling set of all time, and this September's Charming New World, [Bloomborogh.] We continue to see the power of our franchises play out with our digital licensing partners. MONOPOLY GO! from our partners in Scopely is the number one mobile game launch of all time in the U.S. outperforming the launches of global phenomena like Pokemon GO and Candy Crush and the fastest mobile title to reach $1 billion in the U.S. and the game continues to break records. In Q4 alone, the game drove more than $800 million in revenue worldwide for Scopely. As far as our financial participation goes for revenue and profit, it's like having the equivalent of $1 billion movie supporting MONOPOLY, except every year with the impact growing sequentially as the game works through our minimum guarantees and marketing allowances. Baldur's Gate 3 from our partners at Larian continues to win awards around the world and is one of the highest-rated video games of all time. We expect a long tail into 2024 and beyond for this mega hit. Last but not least, we have a compelling new lineup of adventures, core rule books and new digital-first offerings for D&D as we celebrate this iconic brand's 50th anniversary. We'll launch the biggest update to fifth edition since its introduction in 2014, reinventing everything from the artwork of our iconic monsters, to new classes, to new mechanics, to bold new ways to bring to life the world of D&D digitally. All of this will add up to more and more impressive products as the year goes on, leading into an even brighter 2025. We look forward to sharing more about 2025, all new brands, entertainment collaborations and a chance to really show what this team is capable of later this year. Wrapping up, 2023 was a challenging year, but not without significant wins. Wins we believe augur the Hasbro to come, a company we dedicated to play, innovation and fun for fans of all ages. Last year, we launched a top toy with FURBY. We won a Game of the Year award with Twister Air, and we wowed tens of millions with MONOPOLY GO!, Transformers: Rise of the Beast, Baldur's Gate 3 and Magic Lord of the Rings. All while cleaning up the business, selling eOne, paying down debt and clearing excess inventory, which makes for a healthier, stronger Hasbro to start 2024. I'm excited to see the results to come. I'd now like to turn over the call to Gina to share more about our detailed results and to provide guidance for the year. Gina?"", 'Gina Goetter', ""Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 2023 marks an important milestone in our transformation towards a more streamlined and profitable toy and game companies. As Chris mentioned, transformations take time. And amidst the tough industry backdrop, I'm proud of the progress that Hasbro team made over the past several quarters in resetting the business and getting us in the best position for 2024. Before I touch on the financial highlights from the past year, I want to recap 3 major actions we took and how to think through their impacts. First, we successfully closed the sale of the eOne Film and TV business to Lionsgate and we used the proceeds to reduce debt by $400 million, which will result in annual interest expense savings of approximately $25 million. In addition to reducing our leverage, the sale of eOne frees up capital to invest in higher growth initiatives while allowing us to continue monetizing Hasbro IP in an asset-light structure. In conjunction with the sale and the change in the business strategy for family brands, namely PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS, we recorded a noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment of approximately $1 billion, which you will see in our reported results. As we look to 2024, besides the reduction in interest expense, we also expect to see an improvement in operating margin as well as an improvement to cash flow given the reduction in production spending. Second, in Q4, we accelerated efforts to clean up our excess inventory. As I had mentioned last quarter, we were focused on starting 2024 in a cleaner position and would remain agile in taking actions consistent with broader category momentum. While we landed within our revenue guidance, we do not see the holiday season pickup that we were hoping for, and as a result, with more aggressive actions in bringing inventory levels down over 50% from the prior year. Our inventory is now running well below pre-pandemic levels, and we believe this improved position will allow us to drive higher value retail distribution and return focus to upcoming toy and game innovation. We also expect annual savings of roughly $10 million from exiting overflow locations previously used to store excess inventory. And while this was the right decision for the long-term health of the business, the near-term impact from accelerating this cleanup resulted in a roughly $130 million noncash impact to operating income. Lastly, as part of our operational excellence program, we made the difficult decision in Q4 to reduce the size of our workforce. While these decisions are never easy, this move will enable cost savings, which will improve profitability and fuel investments towards long-term growth around toy and digital games innovation. Moving to our financial results and business segment highlights. In Q4, we saw a continuation of the trends seen throughout much of the year. Total Hasbro revenue of $1.3 billion was down 23% versus last year. Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenue increased 7% behind ongoing contributions from the award-winning Baldur's Gate 3 and MONOPOLY GO!, consumer products declined 25% due to the planned business exits, broader category declines and an enhanced focus on clearing inventory. Q4 adjusted operating loss of $50 million was down year-on-year, mostly driven by nonrecurring and noncash charges of $168 million, which includes the $130 million of inventory write-offs. We believe the cleanup efforts are behind us as we are starting 2024 at much healthier levels compared to prior years, and our retail inventory is at an acceptable level. Q4 adjusted net earnings were $52 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.38, also down versus the prior year, primarily due to the aforementioned nonrecurring charges. For the full year 2023, Total Hasbro revenue of $5 billion was down 15% versus 2022 and within our previously stated guidance range. Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenues grew 10% ahead of our guidance, benefiting from the success of Baldur's Gate 3, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY GO!. Consumer Products revenues were down 19% for the full year, driven by planned business exits, softer industry trends and stronger inventory management on behalf of our retailers. Adjusting for the exited brands and markets, revenue would have declined by 15%. And despite the tougher category backdrop, we delivered some bright spots within our toy portfolio, including TRANSFORMERS, Twister Air, FURBY and G.I. Joe. On a reported basis, the Entertainment segment revenue declined by 31% as the writer and actors strikes impacted content deliveries. Family Brands revenue grew 6% from streaming deals of animated content in support of Hasbro's brands. Total Hasbro, Inc. 2023 adjusted operating profit was $477 million, down 48% versus last year, primarily driven by the nonrecurring expenses as well as lower revenues. 2023 adjusted net earnings of $349 million or $2.51 per diluted share was down 44% versus last year. Besides the charges for inventory, Earnings were negatively impacted by content impairments and higher royalty expense, partially offset by our cost savings program and a onetime tax benefit. Operating cash flow for the full year was $726 million, well ahead of our guidance and nearly doubled from the prior year driven mostly by a working capital benefit of approximately $350 million due to the inventory cleanup efforts. We ended the year with $545 million in cash on our balance sheet and reduced debt by approximately $500 million. We also returned $388 million of capital to our shareholders via dividends. Before I move to guidance for 2024. I want to frame how we're thinking about the year ahead from an operational perspective and in particular, how we're looking to turn around the Consumer Products business. In 2023, we took the necessary steps in our transformation to reset the business. This year, with the right foundation in place, we are focused on reinvigorating innovation across the portfolio while continuing to drive operational rigor which we expect to pave the way for sustainable profitable growth. The near-term model that we're building is one where cost productivity provides the fuel to innovate and grow the business. And in 2024, there remains a significant opportunity to improve the underlying profitability while rebuilding its innovation engine. These 2 go hand-in-hand and align with our overarching strategy of focusing on fewer, bigger and better brands. Over the past several quarters, we have been mobilizing around this imperative and taking actions to simplify and prioritize resources on our largest portfolios and biggest bets. One of the single biggest contributors to complexity reduction relates to our product portfolio. Moving into 2024, we have eliminated about half of our SKUs. These SKUs were only 2% of our revenue and were duplicative and unprofitable, clouding the network and creating cost for us and our retailers. Along similar lines, we made the decision to move to an out-license model for brands where we determine their respective path to scale and profitability as an owned and operated entity to not meet our internal thresholds. In 2024 FurReal Friends and Easy Bake Oven will transition. While there are short-term impacts to revenue from this model shift, we ultimately can expect greater operating profit dollars from out-licensed IP and it allows us to focus resources back to our core brands. In 2023, we started the work to streamline our supply chain and improve the efficiency of the organization. And in 2024, we will be continuing these efforts by reaching further upstream to unlock value in our product design and manufacturing processes. We are taking an organization-wide focus across the supply chain, brand teams, product development, procurement and manufacturing to identify ways and redefine the right design to value equation for each product. Ultimately, this will culminate in higher margins and contribute to an improved play experience. We started this work last year on select brands within our Hasbro Gaming portfolio, and we'll be rapidly extending this approach to 2 of our biggest brands, NERF and PLAY-DOH. Also within our supply chain, we are building new capabilities within planning and forecasting to ensure that inventory levels both owned and retail remain within the desired thresholds. We made significant progress coming out of 2023, and these updated processes and tools will ensure that we maintain a healthy inventory position. Since coming on board at Hasbro, I've talked about the imperative to bring costs down within managed expenses to stop the dynamic of overhead growing faster than revenue, particularly within the Consumer Products segment. In December, we announced the next round of actions to address the organizational structure. We have also introduced zero-based budgeting as a tool to help us optimize our spending and ensure dollars invested are driving the right actions in our -- in support of our strategy. And finally, we are continuing to enhance our capabilities around consumer insights, revenue growth management and marketing effectiveness as core drivers in strengthening our foundation and enhancing product development. Looking forward to the 2024 holidays, we have more innovation compared to last year that's backed by insights and stronger pricing precision. This, coupled with stronger planned execution with our retailers, will enable Q4 growth across the toy business. Turning to guidance for 2024 and looking more closely at the 2 main operating segments. Total Wizards revenue is forecasted down 3% to 5%. The decline is primarily a result of the strong growth delivered in 2023 behind the launch of Baldur's Gate 3 and the Magic Lord of the Rings set. Looking at each of the pieces, we are planning for growth within D&D with the upcoming update of the fifth edition and the continued expansion of D&D Beyond. MAGIC will have the same number of releases in 2024 as last year, but revenue will be flat to down as we comp Lord of the Rings. It's important to call out that MAGIC will be back to growth in 2025 as we expand our Universes Beyond lineup. Licensed digital games will be relatively flat. The revenue from Baldur's Gate 3 will begin to taper down as we move through the year and will be partially offset by the continued momentum of MONOPOLY GO!. With the success of the game, we are now anticipating that we will begin to record revenue higher than the contract minimum guarantee in the back half of the year. From a phasing standpoint, we expect Wizards revenue to grow in the front half with the decline coming in the back half as we comp the huge launches. Wizard's operating margin will be between 38% and 40%, which will be up 200 to 400 basis points versus last year. The margin improvement is a result of a favorable mix shift within Digital, lower royalty rates across MAGIC and strong cost management within operating expenses. Margins are also benefiting from supply chain cost productivity more than offsetting the inflation. For Consumer Products, revenue will be down 7% to 12%. About half of the decline is due to actions we've taken to improve profitability, including the planned business exits as well as a reduction in unprofitable closeout revenue given the significant inventory cleanup executed at year-end. The other half of the decline is a result of prevailing category trends. Overall, we are planning to grow share in the categories in which we compete and are leaning into innovation green shoots with step-ups in Hasbro Gaming, BEYBLADE, PLAY-DOH, FURBY and NERF. And we are also adopting a more agile approach with our marketing dollars to better target consumers and increase the effectiveness of the spend. We are forecasting revenue trends will improve as we move through the year with steeper declines in Q1 and Q2 and stabilization coming in the back half of the year behind innovation, marketing effectiveness and maintaining healthy retail inventory levels heading into the holidays. A key focus for 2024 is improving the profitability of toys, and we are forecasting operating margins to be between 4% and 6%, which is 500 to 700 basis points better than last year. Approximately 400 basis points of improvement is driven by the lap of the nonrecurring inventory charges, and this is almost completely offset by the anticipated volume declines and associated deleverage impact. The additional margin expansion is driven by a combination of favorable product mix due to less closeout volume, supply chain cost savings more than offsetting inflation, reduce complexity across the network and operating expense reductions. Margin will also be positively impacted from the work on SKU elimination and design to value, which I mentioned earlier. For entertainment, stripping out the impact of the eOne divestiture, revenue will be down approximately $15 million versus last year and operating margin will show significant improvement driven by operating expense reductions as well as lapping the impact of the D&D movie impairment in 2023. We will continue to report entertainment as a separate segment for 2024, albeit on a much smaller base. As part of the 2024 guidance, we are increasing our gross cost savings target through 2025, from the $350 million to $400 million communicated in December to $750 million. Through 2023, we have delivered approximately $220 million of gross cost savings and anticipate a sizable step up as we move through the next 2 years. Roughly half of the gross cost savings will drop to the bottom line as we focus on improving profitability and the remaining dollars will be reinvested back into the business to support growth initiatives, including the reinvigoration of toy innovation and the continued investment in the gaming business. With the improvement in operating margin across all segments, total Hasbro, Inc. EBITDA is forecasted to be $925 million to $1 billion, up $215 million to $290 million versus the prior year. The positive impact from the cost structure reset as well as the lack of the onetime inventory cleanup in 2023 is more than able to offset the revenue decline and cost inflation. We are planning for relatively flat owned inventory levels in 2024 and estimate approximately $225 million of project capital to support growth initiatives and invest back into the infrastructure as we continue to rebuild the underpinning of the operation. Ending cash will be slightly down versus 2023, driven by relatively flat owned inventory levels, increased capital project spending and additional costs associated with the restructuring actions announced in December. From a capital allocation standpoint, our priorities remain to first invest behind the core business. Second is to return cash to shareholders via the dividend; and third, to continue progressing towards our long-term leverage targets and pay down debt. As you heard Chris mention, we remain committed to our category-leading dividend and believe that the changes that we've made within working capital to free up cash as well as the changes we're making on the broader cost structure provide enough cash flexibility to deliver on the capital allocation priorities. The Board has declared our next quarterly dividend payable in May, and keeping consistent with industry best practices as we move through 2024, we will be shifting the declaration of the dividend to more closely align with the record date. And to close, looking out beyond 2024, we expect that the Consumer Products business will return to low single-digit revenue growth and that Wizards will return to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. With our step-up in cost savings, we remain committed to getting to 20% operating margin with the potential to reach that milestone before 2027. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris to wrap up."", 'Christian Cocks', ""Thanks, Gina. Turnarounds take time, and for our toy business, we are still in the early innings. While we're likely to face some near-term industry headwinds in 2024 and we're comping a better-than-planned 2023 for Wizards. The work we have done under the hood to strengthen our balance sheet, upgrade our planning and rightsize our inventory are a strong foundation to build from. I want to thank the teams at Hasbro for driving this and putting our fans first. This year is all about execution as we build on that foundation, drive our profitability and reinvigorate our innovation pipeline for category share gains in 2024 and renewed top line growth in 2025 and beyond. We'll now pause to take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will be from the line of Eric Handler with ROTH MKM.', 'Eric Owen Handler', 'A lot to digest here. I wonder if you could talk about what the retail situation and your cost structure looks like international versus North America?', 'Christian Cocks', ""Sure. I think perhaps Gina and I will answer this question. Eric, generally speaking, we're feeling pretty good about where our retail situation is. In the U.S. and Europe, in terms of retail inventory, we're down about 20% year-over-year. That translates to about a 4-week improvement on [weekly] supply. So between Europe and the U.S., we generally have about 17 to 20 weeks of supply at our major retailers which is about what we'd like to see. It's about what our normal is pre-pandemic. So generally speaking, that means we neither see retail inventory as a tailwind or a headwind, which is nice because over the last year or so, it's been decidedly a headwind as retailers have been trying to rightsize their inventories. I think if we have any concerns inside of retail, it's that there's still a lot of industry discounted merchandise, particularly in what we would call the growth channel or kind of like value resellers that's going to take a quarter or two to work through. But again, based on our inventory position, we have very little aged inventory and any aged inventory we have has a PO associated with it. So we feel in a generally good position. Gina, anything to add?"", 'Gina Goetter', ""Eric, the second part of your question about the profitability between North America and our international markets. I mean North America is our highest-margin market. Within international, a couple of things that draw that margin profile down. One is within the allowances and just how we intersect or interact with the retailers that is a bit more costly than what we have in the U.S. And the second piece is really within our overhead structure to support the international business. Both of those pieces we are working to address. So through our initiatives of revenue growth management, that is squarely focused on all of that cost that's sitting between gross revenue and net revenue. And then the second piece on overhead, all of the cost savings initiatives that we put into motion will start to attack on the cost structure, broadly in North America as well as with international."", 'Eric Owen Handler', ""Great. And then just as a follow-up, Chris, you've talked before about the inevitability that MAGIC has to see a slowdown just because of law of large numbers in revenue. And D&D was supposed to pick up the torch and drive higher growth. I wonder if you could talk about maybe some of the key drivers with D&D that as you look out over the next few years, what's going to build that business even more?"", 'Christian Cocks', ""Yes, for sure. So last year, we were fortunate in that, both MAGIC and D&D were growers for us. The MAGIC tabletop business was up probably in the 3% to 5% range. We had a little bit of attrition on digital, but still the business was up low single digits. And D&D was up over 75% on a total brand basis, I think the contributors for D&D's growth last year will be very similar to what they'll be moving forward. We continue to think D&D Beyond was an excellent acquisition. It really is the way increasingly people are playing, tabletop role-playing games. I think it's an excellent platform for us to build upon and expand the ways that people can play, the ways that people can experience theater to the mind and also for us to distribute and showcase a more diverse set of content, whether that's Universes Beyond style content, like we do with MAGIC or our major creators content or user-generated content. So I think you'll see more from that on the tabletop side. We continue to have a robust entertainment slate on D&D that we're working with several partners behind notably the new streaming series from Paramount that we're partnering with them on and then video games will clearly be a huge leg up on the D&D business. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the seminal role playing games of all time. It's won multiple Game of the Year awards. Our partners at Larian really knocked it out of the park with that, and were fantastic to work with. Baldur's Gate 3 is just the first of several new video games that will be coming out over the next 5 to 10 years that I think will continue to power that franchise. And really, I think the 3 combined continued innovation on tabletop powered by D&D Beyond targeted entertainment, working through partners in an asset-light model and then great video game content through licensees and through our own internal studios. I think the future is bright for that brand."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.', 'Christopher Michael Horvers', ""So first, a clarification, did you say you expect consumer products to be flat in 3Q and then up in 4Q, in that mix, how are you thinking about NERF growing again? And to what extent are you taking in a shorter holiday calendar next year? And as a part of that fourth quarter question, could you mention what the specific lift in 4Q '23 was from clearance sales?"", 'Gina Goetter', ""All right. I will try to dissect all of those for you, Chris, the guidance of phasing, generally right, within CPs. So as we think about the guide of 7% to 12% down, you're going to see steeper declines in Q1 and Q2, similar to what we saw playing through Q3 is kind of the average of what we saw playing through in Q3, Q4. As we look at Q3 of '24, we start to stabilize as we move into Q4, we're planning for growth. As we think about which brands are going to carry it, it's really behind the strong innovation that we're putting in, NERF being one of them. So we do have some innovation that's coming. That will be a market kind of in the back half of the year as we had in the holiday. In terms of your last question on the lift specifically from closeouts, I don't know that I have that number to an exact extent. What I would say is that our closeout volume and revenue was generally consistent with what we saw play through the year prior. There wasn't a huge delta from previous years and then couple that with all of the efforts that we took to clean up inventory as we're looking here in the front part of the year, we're seeing that closeout volume come down quite significantly. So nothing I would call out as different as we play through Q4."", 'Christian Cocks', ""As you think about the back half, Chris, I'd be really looking at BEYBLADE X as a huge launch for us. It did many orders of magnitude larger in the launch in Japan last year versus Beyblade Burst from 2016. We're expecting it to be quite a runner and the early feedback from the toy fairs as our retailers are getting behind it as well. We have some really cool innovation across price points for PLAY-DOH that I think will continue to run on that brand, both building share and building point-of-sale and sell-in. And then we have quite a lineup of board games that will be coming out throughout the year. But generally speaking, we have a good Q4 for our board games, and we think this year will be no exception."", 'Christopher Michael Horvers', ""Got it. And then on the MAGIC business, I guess how many of the larger releases that you mentioned, would you expect could eclipse $100 million and then from a Universes Beyond perspective, was there any shift into '24 from IP partnerships that you were expecting in '23?"", 'Christian Cocks', ""Sure. So last year, we did 6 premier sets per year, which is like large sets that go across formats. I think last year, 5 of our 6 premier sets eclipsed to $100 million I don't think we have a specific forecast for each of the premier sets this year, but we will have 6 sets this year. We think actually we'll have probably slightly less kind of secondary sets or secondary SKUs associated with MAGIC and so we're projecting flat to slightly down for the brand. So I think you can do the math and say it's roughly about the number of equivalent sets that are hitting that $100 million bogey. As you think about universe is beyond, last year, we had our first, what we would call premier set for Universes Beyond that was Magic, Lord of the Rings. That did over $200 million in under 6 months. This year, we have some smaller Universes Beyond sets. The first one is going to be fallout, which will come up in March. That won't be at the same scale or size, but we'll do better than what a typical Commander set would do. But starting in 2025, we're going to have 2 premier Universes Beyond sets as part of our mix. And we believe the brands that we'll be shipping in 2025 have the same kind of carrying power as the Lord of the Rings. The one that we've announced will be in the front half of the year, and that's Final Fantasy, which is just a juggernaut in role-playing games. We've announced partnerships with a host of other brands, Marvel being one of the last ones that we kind of talked about. There'll be multiple sets associated with that. So for '25 going forward, you should expect to see as part of our 6 premier sets per year, 2 of them will be Universes Beyond branded and we think we'll have a similar uplift to what we experienced with Lord of the Rings. And so that's underlaying a lot of our bullishness on the growth for MAGIC."", 'Operator', 'Our next questions are from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS.', 'Arpine Kocharyan', ""So EBITDA finished the year at around $700 million, and you expect around $250 million of incremental cost saves in 2024, but then you're probably annualizing cost saves from 2023 with some kind of underlying decline in EBITDA. Could you just maybe bridge to the puts and takes of 2024 EBITDA guide for the year for us because there's also cost to those cost savings, as I understand, if you could just go through the puts and takes. And then I have a quick follow-up for Chris."", 'Gina Goetter', ""Got it. Sure. Happy to do so. So if you kind of named some of them, as we think about the build from where we stood in the $750 million. Keep in mind that we have that onetime, all those nonrecurring charges come back, that is a benefit to us next year, that becomes a tailwind, almost completely offsetting that tailwind though is the volume coming down -- the revenue coming down. So the onetime benefit is offset then by the volume and a delev impact. Overall, we have supply chain productivity that is going to be offsetting inflation. So when you think about the cost saves, that's one piece of the cost saves, supply chain productivity. The second big piece really is what's happening within our operating expenses. So when you think about the people cost as well as just broader managed expense savings, that becomes an adder back for us as we think about 2024. And the last piece that is positive is just the overall mix of our business. So not only within (inaudible) where we have this continued mix into digital. But within that is CP business as well, when we, again, took all those actions from a closeout standpoint, the volume that we're going to be moving through in 2024, it's higher profit volume for us. So those are some of the big puts and takes. Really, the big negative for us as we head into '24 is just what's happening on the revenue line and the impact that, that's having."", 'Arpine Kocharyan', ""Great. And then, Chris, you had talked about $500 million of D&D business over a 3-, 4-year period. I was wondering if that's still the guidance for D&D. I know you addressed some of that earlier. But if you could just go over kind of the long-term growth prospects for that business in terms of sizing it for us, similar to how you best communicated in October Analyst Day to kind of -- I know you're not ready to update that guidance, but just sort of -- is that $500 million still the right number to think about?"", 'Christian Cocks', ""Yes. No worries. Arpine, by the way, I heard you have a new child. Congratulations. We always appreciate it when people make customers. I would say that guidance holds. The D&D brand and our games portfolio overall is trucking along at a similar pace as we expected. That guidance was more of a 2027-ish time frame. I think a little bit will depend on certain calendars associated with certain video games and there's a certain amount of schedule slippage that you get with that. But generally speaking, we feel good about the trajectory of the brand. And as I mentioned in Eric's question, kind of like the 3 core pillars that underlie it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Megan Alexander with Morgan Stanley.', 'Megan Christine Alexander', ""I was wondering, Gina, if maybe we could unpack the revenue guidance for consumer products just a bit more, you cited that 4 points from exiting the licensing. Maybe you can help us understand what's implied from an industry POS expectation. And I guess, is the comment that retail inventory is not a headwind or a tailwind, should we assume that you're just kind of shipping in line with POS?"", 'Gina Goetter', ""Yes, good question, Megan. And that's where I was going to lead you, just especially given where our inventory positions are sitting, our assumption that we're making is that our shipment has been more closely aligned with POS. In fact, we actually started to see that happen towards the tailwind of this year. So if you think about the guide that gives you an indication of how we're thinking about just the broader macro environment. So if you take those, call it, roughly 4 points out for just the business exit, you're left with down 3 to 8, in the down 3 scenario, that would be us over delivering and gaining share and beating the market. Down 8 is probably more similar of us moving in line with the market. But I think you've got the equation right, our shipments are going to more closely kind of aligned with POS."", 'Megan Christine Alexander', ""Okay. And then could you maybe quantify the net cost savings that are embedded in the guide? I think per your slides, you're going to get to kind of $500 million of gross cost savings by the end of this year. You've kind of said you didn't -- you haven't really seen any last year. So on that, call it, net $250 million, if you reinvest 50%. What's embedded this year? And I know you talked about some cost inflation. Is that freight? Are you still seeing product inflation, whether it's things like resin, can you just maybe quantify what is actually embedded in the guide?"", 'Gina Goetter', ""Sure, absolutely. Let me start on that. Let's start on the inflation side first, and then we'll work our way back. So embedded in the guidance roughly an inflation rate of 3%, the single biggest inflation driver for us this year will be labor, labor within manufacturing and labor within the broader logistics network. We're also seeing some inflation within resin to your point, and that's our single biggest component that we're purchasing. We are seeing that inflate and then fuel. So I think between those 3 pieces, you're roughly getting to 3%. We believe we have cost productivity that more than offsets all of that. So specifically within kind of our cost of goods, we will be a net margin contributor because we -- how that will play out. In terms of the total gross saves cost saves, I think it's fair to say that roughly, call it, $200 million, $250 million will be net cost savings. Between this supply chain cost productivity offsetting inflation as well as all of the moves that we're making below the line within managed expenses, whether it be people costs coming down or just broader purchase expenses coming down."", 'Megan Christine Alexander', ""Great. And just to clarify, that $200 million to $250 million is -- that's a net tailwind versus '23 and that kind of should be independent of whether the top line is kind of above or below or at the high end or the low end of your guide?"", 'Gina Goetter', ""That's right. Yes, that's right."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies.', 'Andrew Paul Uerkwitz', 'I guess I want to stick with Wizards of the Coast. If I think beyond 2024, what kind of cadence would we have in digital games? We saw 2 big games last year, no new ones this year as far as we know. Like what kind of cadence should we expect there on the digital game side? And any clue on the mix between mobile and traditional PC console?', 'Christian Cocks', ""Andrew, yes, I would say for -- starting in '26, we'll probably have one major new digital game that we'll publish and then '27 to '30, it will be anywhere between 1 to 2 depending on how the schedules kind of shake out. From a licensing perspective, I think you should generally see our licensing business after taking maybe a little bit of a step back this year just given the Baldur's Gate 3 launch bulge, take a little bit of a step back this year, but then it will grow sequentially every year as we just expand the number of licensors and games like MONOPOLY GO! continue to mature and become more profitable for us. We're constantly adding new licensors to the mix, so it's a little difficult to give you a lot of precise guidance about kind of like the mix between mobile or kind of like somewhat like the casino gambling that we also licensed to or PC and console. But generally speaking, our license mix tends to be more mobile and casino gambling then it would be PC and console because that's where we're going to tend to focus our publishing efforts."", 'Andrew Paul Uerkwitz', ""Got it. That's very helpful. And then on the Universes Beyond sets coming beyond 2024, is the goal there with Marvel and Final Fantasy to find new audiences to kind of better monetize your current audience or even maybe flipping around a bit, you're great in competitive, I think you're very good in kind of social gaming, but that collector spot of kids just buying cars for fun. Where are you trying to really target with some of these Universes Beyond sets with Final Fantasy and Marvel?"", 'Christian Cocks', ""Well, I think it's, generally speaking, all of the above. However, I think the special emphasis for Universes Beyond is new player growth. The Lord of the Rings was by far and away the most successful product at bringing in new players into the franchise that we've ever released. We would anticipate that would be the same or potentially even greater for IPs like Lord of the Rings or Marvel or some of the future things that we have in store. So it's a great way for us to expand the base of users and grow future sets over time."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.', 'Jaime M. Katz', ""I'd be interested to hear how you guys feel you have completed the brand pruning process. Is that largely done? Is it still underway? I'm just trying to think about what other headwinds we might have in the future."", 'Christian Cocks', ""Jaime, I would say it's largely done. There might be 1 or 2 more, and we would announce those deals within the next month or two and then I would say moving forward, you should think about us as net brand creators."", 'Gina Goetter', ""Yes, my only add on the -- to cleanup, I would say that kind of the same sentiment holds like we're done with the cleanup. So as we head into '24, we're rebuilding now, we're building now."", 'Jaime M. Katz', ""Okay. And then, Gina, I don't think it's been delineated. What portion of the cost savings are coming out of cost of goods sold relative to SG&A. My suspicion is most of it's out of that SG&A line. But do you have that bifurcated and an easy way to digest?"", 'Gina Goetter', ""Yes. Yes, my very simple would say, yes, you're right, it's about half and half. If I look at the big buckets. Little bit that we did in '23 on royalty expense, but it's really a small change compared to the cost savings we're driving within supply chain and within the managed or operating expenses. So it's almost half and half."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Jason Haas with Bank of America.', 'Jason Daniel Haas', ""I'm curious if you could say what POS was for you guys in 4Q. And then I'm also curious, it sounds like you're expecting the industry could be down as much as 8% in 2024, but then expect it to get back to -- I think you said low single-digit growth thereafter. So I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on why you think the industry will be down so much? And then what needs to change to get it back to growth?"", 'Christian Cocks', ""Yes, in Q4, we were down around 12% or 13% on our internal point-of-sale measurements. When you factor out some of the exited licenses that we didn't comp, it was more down around negative 9% in the quarter which roughly tracks around what the industry did. We think the industry did between negative 9% and negative 10%. For the full fiscal year, we were down negative 10% to negative 11% based on our internal point-of-sale tracking and ex these kind of exited brands, we were down about negative 6%, which, again, roughly tracks with kind of what our feeling is for the industry. In terms of our call for industry trends moving forward, I think generally speaking, we think the prevailing trends that existed in the back half of 2023 are likely going to persist into at least the first half of 2024. And probably into the second half of 2024. We still have a little bit of a correction from pre-COVID toy share of wallet that we think we're experiencing in markets like the U.S. We do see growth in places like Latin America and Southeast Asia. And we generally are kind of thinking that once we get through 2024, we're largely past that kind of post-COVID correction, and we start getting back into a toy market, which from our planning purposes, we're basically projecting to be around flat and that based on our innovation and the marketing that we're putting together and just the general kind of fundamental health of the business, that we're reinjecting into it, that we can grow at that level or likely ahead of that level and build some share, particularly in the categories we're focused on."", 'Jason Daniel Haas', ""Got it. That's really helpful. And then a follow-up. I was curious if you could help size up how much Baldur's Gate 3 and MONOPOLY GO! contributed in 4Q. Maybe give some color on it for 2024, but just -- yes, just curious, any more color on what those two contribute as we go through 2024 would be helpful."", 'Gina Goetter', ""As we move to '24, yes, so MONOPOLY GO! in Q4. It was just the minimum guarantee that we booked in from a revenue standpoint and Baldur's Gate had another healthy quarter. I think for the year, in totality, Baldur's Gate was around $90 million of revenue. So now if you turn the corner into 2024, the front half of the year, you're still going to have the tail from Baldur's Gate 3. That's going to stay with us all year, obviously, not at the same extent that we saw play during Q3 and Q4, but we'll still be selling units and making revenue and profit off of that product. For MONOPOLY GO!, what gets interesting is that based on our forecast, based on how well the game is doing as we get into the back half of the year, we believe we'll be able to start booking revenue and profit ahead of our minimum guarantee. Now we don't get into the terms of the contracts and kind of what that royalty rate is. But suffice is to say, as we think about the comp that we're up against at MONOPOLY GO! in the back half, MONOPOLY GO! has been almost get there, not quite get there, but almost get there and kind of offset the headwind that we have from Baldur's Gate."", 'Jason Daniel Haas', ""That's just a quick clarification. I think you said earlier that you're expecting -- I think you said digital game licenses, I think it was just going to be flat year-over-year. So is that right that the full amount of MONOPOLY GO! and Baldur's Gate 3 in 2024 should roughly be equivalent to what we saw in 2023?"", 'Gina Goetter', ""Yes. I think you're saying that right."", 'Operator', 'Next questions come from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson.', 'Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser', 'So I guess I took from your comments that you said that cash balance would be down in the end of 2024 versus 2023. So I take that to mean that operating cash flow minus CapEx minus dividends will be negative. Am I reading that correctly? And do you have a guidance number or range for operating cash flow like you usually give for 2024?', 'Gina Goetter', ""I mean, we haven't officially made a guidance, but it's going to be -- operating cash flow is going to be slightly down versus where we landed the year strictly because of the inventory benefit that we got. We captured that as part of our 2023 cash flow. In terms of ending cash, it's slightly down. I mean, you could almost argue that ending cash is going to be relatively flat year-over-year, but I mean it's slightly down, and it's slightly down because we're stepping up our capital expense a little bit. And then we also have additional charges related to the announcements that we had in December that play in. But no, we don't get to negative free cash."", 'Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser', 'So can you help me understand the change in cash taxes paid and also the change in outflow related to cash restructuring in 2024 versus 2023?', 'Gina Goetter', ""The cash -- I'm going to have to follow up with you on the cash tax. In terms of the cost for restructuring, we paid roughly, I would say, call it, $70-ish million in -- as we move through '23. And as we move into 2024, that's going to be roughly, call it, $100 million."", 'Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser', 'Okay. That would be for cash restructuring, things like severance and other cash costs?', 'Gina Goetter', ""Correct. That's right."", 'Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser', ""Okay. And then I know that you really want to protect and continue to pay the dividend, but one might argue that Mattel's turnarounds really started when they cut the dividend because it gave them a little bit of flexibility to work down the debt. You really didn't state any leverage targets for 2024 or 2025. Your stock is trading as if the dividend is not safe. So one might argue that it would really benefit shareholders to at least reduce the dividend so that you could work down the debt a little bit faster. Can you just respond to that idea?"", 'Gina Goetter', ""I'm going to go back to our prepared comments, and both Chris and I remain -- and our Board remains supportive of our capital allocation strategy, which includes the dividend and we believe the actions that we've taken both in '23 and '24 to free up cash, support those capital allocation priorities. I hear your point on the delev and getting to those targets faster. We're still committed to getting to those delev targets. We think though that fixing the business also is going to free up our ability to hit all of our cap allocation priorities."", 'Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser', ""And then just my next question is just more operational. I guess one of the things that kind of -- what wrong, I guess, you could say, in 2023, is that the industry POS slowed a lot in the second half or it wasn't what you would have thought. And that was the same for Mattel. So is there anything about 2024 that if the industry actually gets worse versus what you're projecting, is there any flexibility or levers that you can use to better reach your financial goals in 2024, even if the industry ends up being different than you thought?"", 'Christian Cocks', ""Well, I would say our projection for the industry is probably on the more cautious side than what most independent analysts or other toy companies would have. So I think we're going in with the cautious outlook. I also think we have a lot of tools in our quiver in terms of cash liquidity we've got $1 billion, $1.8 billion of cash liquidity and options. Should we have to weather a down quarter or two that is worse than what we're predicting. And our new management team, I think, is showing quite an adeptness at cost management and supply chain management. So there are levers that we have to pull. We feel quite confident in our ability to execute against our capital allocation priorities, which are investing in the business for long-term growth. Continuing to give money back to shareholders via our dividend and in achieving our long-term deleverage targets, which is 2.5 or less."", 'Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser', 'Okay. Good luck with everything.', 'Operator', 'Our final question is from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs.', 'Stephen Neild Laszczyk', ""One on longer-term margins and one on CapEx, maybe first for Gina on margins, just given the new cost efficiency targets, could you update us on your view for what you think the medium- to long-term margin opportunity in consumer products is and maybe the path to get there beyond the 4% to 6% you guided in 2024. And then just on CapEx, you called out the $225 million in CapEx for this year. Could you just unpack a little bit more in terms of what that's being invested into? And maybe what you think the long-term outlook for CapEx is on an annualized basis beyond some of the initial programs?"", 'Gina Goetter', ""Got it. Okay. Good question, Stephen. So on margins, overall for the company, we remain committed to getting to that 20% midterm target that I think we put out there at our last Investor Day. As you break down the CP number, we have a lot of momentum on the margin side as we head into this year. I believe as we turn into '25 and '26, we're continuing to refine what's happening within our supply chain, what's happening within our cost structure. So that will provide some uplift on the margin. But the single biggest thing that's going to help us keep moving to the 10s, to the teens and beyond on toy is really volume. And our -- getting back to growth, putting innovation in a market that is actually growing our business. That leverage benefit will have the kind of the single biggest impact on that margin line. So I think we have a good line of sight to the margin targets that we put out there for this year. For next, we are anticipating that our margin is going to grow again. The speed with which we move up that scale will really be dependent on how fast we can get over the growth, the growth comp. In terms of CapEx, that step-up that we're seeing this year really is being driven by our investment in digital games. If you think about that breakdown of $225 million, there is -- roughly half of it goes into our Wizards business. Another, I would say, half of that half then is going back into our toy business, with the remaining piece that's going into our broad infrastructure. So we're continuing to build capabilities, both within just kind of the underpinning of the organization when you think about IT and systems as well as within our broader supply chain."", 'Christian Cocks', ""Yes. And just for strategic context, Stephen, and thanks, by the way, for being the anchor man on the questions for us. Our investments in digital and Digital Gaming, they're foundational to the future of the company. It's something we've been investing in for the last 7 years. It's something that I think you should anticipate that we will at least maintain, if not grow, over the next 3 to 5 years. And it's going to be a material source of value creation, particularly in the game side of our business moving forward. I think we already see that it can work and work fantastically well with what we've been doing with licensing partners, particularly with MONOPOLY GO! and Baldur's Gate 3 last year and great acquisitions like we made with D&D Beyond and I think you're going to see more and more value creation as we go through '24, '25 and into '26."", 'Operator', ""This will conclude our question-and-answer session and also concludes today's conference.

Bigger investment behind winning brands in more focused categories."", ""And Better innovation driven by a renewed leadership team and a focus on kids, parents, and fans, our consumers, the lifeblood of Hasbro. We laid out a blueprint for a more focused and profitable company with a number of growth initiatives built on a diverse portfolio of some of the most iconic brands in the toy and game industry. While business transformations take time, I'm pleased with how much we accomplished in 2023, setting the table for a 2024 punctuated by strong profit growth and momentum in renewing Hasbro's innovation engine. We're entering 2024 with a healthier balance sheet, a leaner cost structure, and an operational rigor that will maintain and build on these improvements in the quarters ahead."", 'In 2023, we took substantial action to bolster our balance sheet. At the end of the year, we closed our deal with Lionsgate on eOne Film and TV, allowing us to focus our investments on higher return, play-focused initiatives across toys, games, and digital. Proceeds from the deal allowed us to reduce our debt by approximately $400 million. As we shipped our entertainment strategy to an asset light and partner-led model, we took a $1 billion impairment, a noncash item in Q4, which reflects the sale of eOne, and a change in outlook for the balance of our own and operated production efforts.', 'This shift frees up more capital for us to reinvest in toys, games, and particularly our digital future. Between hard work from our sales and operations teams and some of the financial actions we took at the end of the quarter, we entered 2024 with inventories down over 50% year over year, which is well below 2019 levels. We also took steps to improve our structural profitability, exiting a number of low or negative profit businesses that we have shifted to a licensed-out model. Finally, we are driving better than expected cost savings through our operational excellence work.', ""Unlocking crucial investment capacity as we seek to connect with fans of all ages and across all play patterns. Previously, we communicated $350 million to $400 million in annual run rate savings. We're updating our target to $750 million of gross savings by the end of 2025, with half of it dropping to the bottom line. This allows us to reinvest in our business, meaningfully improve our cash flows, and return cash to our shareholders, which we are committed to continuing through our category-leading dividend."", ""Since I became CEO in 2022, Hasbro's returned almost $1 billion to shareholders and paid down over $0.5 billion in debt. While 2023 was challenging and we still expect the toy industry to face near-term headwinds, we believe we're taking the necessary steps to turn around our consumer products business. Wizards and Digital Gaming is coming off a banner year led by MAGIC, Universes Beyond, the success of Baldur's Gate III from our partners at Larian, and Monopoly Go! from Scopely. 2024 is about returning consumer products to profitability, investing for long-term momentum in games, and driving significant improvements in Hasbro's bottom line, fueled by operational discipline and renewed product innovation."", ""In short, we're putting all the right pieces together to keep investing in our growth initiatives while expanding the ways our franchises reach fans through digital games. We expect the next year we'll likely see continued headwinds in the toy category. We're exiting 2023 with our retail inventory down around 20%. While we think Hasbro's retail inventory is in a healthy position, across the industry a lot of older discounted inventory still remains in the market."", 'The consumer remains value conscious and we anticipate entertainment will be less of a tailwind in the year ahead, behind a reduced box office slate.

Whether it's adult party games, family card games, casual strategy, or extending mega hits like Monopoly, 2024 will be a big year for gaming from Hasbro."", ""Speaking of games, Wizards and Digital outperformed our guidance in 2023, driven by a series of blockbuster hits. MAGIC had another record year in '23 with a string of amazing new sets, including our best-selling set of all time, The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-Earth. While a product like Lord of the Rings creates a tough comp in 2024, we have some unique sets that fans are eagerly anticipating, including March's Fallout, a new commander-focused Universes Beyond product line, this summer's Modern Horizons III, the sequel to our prior best-selling set of all time, and this September's charming new world, Bloomberg. We continue to see the power of our franchises play out with our digital licensing partners."", ""Monopoly Go! from partners and Scopely is the No. 1 mobile game launch of all time in the U.S., outperforming the launches of global phenomena like Pokémon Go and Candy Crush, and the fastest mobile title to reach $1 billion in the U.S., and the game continues to break records. In Q4 alone, the game drove more than $800 million in revenue worldwide for Scopely. As far as our financial participation goes for revenue and profit, it's like having the equivalent of $1 billion movie supporting Monopoly, except every year, with the impact growing sequentially as the game works through our minimum guarantees and marketing allowances."", ""Baldur's Gate III from our partners of Larian continues to win awards around the world and is one of the highest rated video games of all time. We expect a long tail into 2024 and beyond for this mega hit. Last but not least, we have a compelling new lineup of adventures, core rulebooks, and new digital first offerings for D&D as we celebrate this iconic brand's 50th anniversary. We'll launch the biggest update to fifth edition since its introduction in 2014, reinventing everything from the artwork of our iconic monsters, to new classes, to new mechanics, to bold new ways to bring to life the world of D &D digitally."", 'All of this will add up to more and more impressive product as the year goes on, leading into an even brighter 2025.

Wrapping up, 2023 was a challenging year, but not without significant wins.', 'Wins we believe augur the Hasbro to come. A company rededicated to play, innovation, and fun for fans of all ages. Last year, we launched a top toy with FURBY. We won a Game of the Year award with Twister Air.', ""And we wowed tens of millions with Monopoly Go! Transformers Rise of the Beast, Baldur's Gate III, and Magic Lord of the Rings, all while cleaning up the business, selling eOne, paying down debt, and clearing excess inventory, which makes for a healthier, stronger Hasbro to start 2024. I'm excited to see the results to come. I'd now like to turn over the call to Gina to share more about our detailed results and to provide guidance for the year. Gina?"", 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 2023 marked an important milestone in our transformation toward a more streamlined and profitable toy and game company. As Chris mentioned, transformations take time and amid the tough industry backdrop, I'm proud of the progress the Hasbro team made over the past several quarters in resetting the business and getting us in the best position for 2024. Before I touch on the financial highlights from the past year, I want to recap three major actions we took and how to think through their impacts."", 'First, we successfully closed the sale of the eOne Film and TV business to Lionsgate, and we used the proceeds to reduce debt by $400 million, which will result in annual interest expense savings of approximately $25 million. In addition to reducing our leverage, the sale of eOne frees up capital to invest in higher growth initiatives, while allowing us to continue monetizing Hasbro IP in an asset-light structure. In conjunction with the sale and the change in the business strategy for family brands, namely PEPPA PIG and PJ Masks, we recorded a noncash, goodwill and intangible asset impairment of approximately $1 billion, which you will see in our reported results. As we look to 2024, besides the reduction in interest expense, we also expect to see an improvement in operating margin, as well as an improvement to cash flow, given the reduction in production spending.', 'Second, in Q4, we accelerated efforts to clean up our excess inventory. As I had mentioned last quarter, we were focused on starting 2024 in a cleaner position. And we would remain agile in taking actions consistent with broader category momentum. While we landed within our revenue guidance, we did not see the holiday season pickup that we were hoping for, and as a result took more aggressive actions in bringing inventory levels down over 50% from the prior year.', 'Our inventory is now running well below pre-pandemic levels, and we believe this improved position will allow us to drive higher value retail distribution and return focus to upcoming toy and game innovation. We also expect annual savings of roughly $10 million from exiting overflow locations previously used to store excess inventory. And while this was the right decision for the long-term health of the business, the near term impact from accelerating this cleanup resulted in a roughly $130 million noncash impact to operating income. Lastly, as part of our operational excellence program, we made the difficult decision in Q4 to reduce the size of our workforce.', ""While these decisions are never easy, this move will enable cost savings, which will improve profitability and fuel investments toward long term growth around toy and digital games innovation. Moving to our financial results and business segment highlights, in Q4 we saw a continuation of the trends seen throughout much of the year. Total Hasbro revenue of $1.3 billion was down 23% versus last year. Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenue increased 7% behind ongoing contributions from the award winning Baldur's Gate III and Monopoly Go! Consumer products declined 25% due to the planned business exits, broader category declines, and an enhanced focus on clearing inventory."", 'Q4 adjusted operating loss of $50 million was down year on year, mostly driven by nonrecurring and noncash charges of $168 million which includes the $130 million of inventory write off. We believe the cleanup efforts are behind us as we are starting 2024 at much healthier levels compared to prior years and our retail inventory is at an acceptable level. Q4 adjusted net earnings were $52 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.38, also down versus the prior year, primarily due to the aforementioned nonrecurring charges. For the full year 2023, total Hasbro revenue of $5 billion was down 15% versus 2022 and within our previously stated guidance range.', ""Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenue grew 10%, ahead of our guidance benefiting from the success of Baldur's Gate III, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, and Monopoly Go! Consumer products revenues were down 19% for the full year driven by planned business exits, softer industry trends, and stronger inventory management on behalf of our retailers. Adjusting for the exit of brands and markets, revenue would have declined by 15%. And despite the tougher category backdrop, we delivered some bright spots within our toy portfolio, including Transformers, Twister Air, Furby, and GI Joe. On a reported basis, the entertainment segment revenue declined by 31% as the writers' and actors' strikes impacted content deliveries."", ""Family Brands revenue grew 6% from streaming deals of animated content in support of Hasbro's brands. Total Hasbro Inc. 2023 adjusted operating profit was $477 million, down 48% versus last year, primarily driven by the nonrecurring expenses, as well as lower revenues. 2023 adjusted net earnings of $349 million, or $2.51 per diluted share, was down 44% versus last year."", 'Besides the charges for inventory, earnings were negatively impacted by content impairments and higher royalty expense, partially offset by our cost savings program and a one-time tax benefit. Operating cash flow for the full year was $726 million, well ahead of our guidance and nearly double from the prior year, driven mostly by a working capital benefit of approximately $350 million due to the inventory cleanup efforts. We ended the year with $545 million in cash on our balance sheet and reduced debt by approximately $500 million. We also returned $388 million of capital to our shareholders via dividends.', ""Before I move to guidance for 2024, I want to frame how we are thinking about the year ahead from an operational perspective, and in particular, how we're looking to turn around the consumer product business. In 2023, we took the necessary steps in our transformation to reset the business. This year, with the right foundation in place, we are focused on reinvigorating innovation across the portfolio, while continuing to drive operational rigor, which we expect to pave the way for sustainable profitable growth. The near-term model that we're building is one where cost productivity provides the fuel to innovate and grow the business."", 'And in 2024, there remains a significant opportunity to improve the underlying profitability, while rebuilding its innovation engine. These two go hand-in-hand and align with our overarching strategy of focusing on Fewer, Bigger, and Better brands. Over the past several quarters, we have been mobilizing around this imperative and taking actions to simplify and prioritize resources on our largest portfolios and biggest bets. One of the single biggest contributors to complexity reduction relates to our product portfolio.', 'Moving into 2024, we have eliminated about half of our SKUs. These SKUs were only 2% of our revenue and were duplicative and unprofitable, quashing the network and creating cost for us and our retailers. Along similar lines, we made the decision to move to an out-license model for brands where we determined the respective path to scale and profitability as an owned and operated entity did not meet our internal threshold. In 2024, for Real Friends, an Easy-Bake Oven will transition.', 'While there are short-term impacts to revenue from this model shift, we ultimately can expect greater operating profit dollars from out-license IP and it allows us to focus resources back to our core brands. In 2023, we started the work to streamline our supply chain and improve the efficiency of the organization. And in 2024, we will be continuing these efforts by reaching further upstream to unlock value in our product design and manufacturing processes. We are taking an organizationwide focus across the supply chain, brandings, product development, procurement, and manufacturing to identify waste and redefine the right design-to-value equation for each product.', 'Ultimately, this will culminate in higher margins and contribute to an improved play experience. We started this work last year on select brands within our Hasbro gaming portfolio and will be rapidly extending this approach to two of our biggest brands, NERF and Play-Doh. Also, within our supply chain, we are building new capabilities within planning and forecasting to ensure that inventory levels, both owned and retail, remain within the desired threshold. We made significant progress coming out of 2023 and these updated processes and tools will ensure that we maintain a healthy inventory position.', ""Since coming on board at Hasbro, I've talked about the imperative to bring costs down within managed expenses to stop the dynamic of overhead growing faster than revenue, particularly within the consumer product segment. In December, we announced the next round of actions to address the organizational structure. We have also introduced zero-based budgeting as a tool to help us optimize our spending and ensure dollars invested are driving the right actions in our in-support of our strategy. And finally, we are continuing to enhance our capabilities around consumer insights, revenue growth management, and marketing effectiveness as core drivers in strengthening our foundation and enhancing product development."", ""Looking forward to the 2024 holidays, we have more innovation compared to last year that's backed by insights and stronger pricing precision. This, coupled with stronger planned execution with our retailers, will enable Q4 growth across the toy business. Turning to guidance for 2024 and looking more closely at the two main operating segments, total Wizards revenue is forecasted down 3% to 5%. The decline is primarily a result of the strong growth delivered in 2023 behind the launch of Baldur's Gate III and the Magic Lord of the Rings set."", ""Looking at each of the pieces, we are planning for growth within D&D with the upcoming update of the fifth edition and the continued expansion of D&D beyond. MAGIC will have the same number of releases in 2024 as last year, but revenue will be flat to down as we count Lord of the Rings. It's important to call out that MAGIC will be back to growth in 2025 as we expand our Universes Beyond lineup. Licensed digital games will be relatively flat."", ""The revenue from Baldur's Gate III will begin to taper down as we move through the year and will be partially offset by the continued momentum of Monopoly Go! With the success of the game, we are now anticipating that we will begin to record revenue higher than the contract's minimum guarantee in the back half of the year. From a phasing standpoint, we expect Wizards revenue to grow in the front half with a decline coming in the back half as we comp the huge launches. Wizards operating margin will be between 38 % and 40%, which will be up 200 to 400 basis points versus last year. The margin improvement is a result of a favorable mix shift within digital, lower royalty rates across MAGIC, and strong cost management within operating expenses."", ""Margin are also benefiting from supply chain cost productivity more than offsetting the inflation. For Consumer products, revenue will be down 7% to 12%. About half of the decline is due to actions we've taken to improve profitability, including the planned business exits, as well as a reduction in unprofitable closeout revenue given the significant inventory cleanup executed at year end. The other half of the decline is a result of prevailing category trends."", 'Overall, we are planning to grow share in the categories in which we compete and are leaning into innovation green shoots with step ups in Hasbro gaming, Beyblade, Play-Doh, FURBY, and NERF. And we are also adopting a more agile approach with our marketing dollars to better target consumers and increase the effectiveness of the spend. We are forecasting revenue trends will improve as we move through the year with steeper declines in Q1 and Q2 and stabilization coming in the back half of the year behind innovation, marketing effectiveness, and maintaining healthy retail inventory levels heading into the holidays. A key focus for 2024 is improving the profitability of toys.', 'And we are forecasting operating margins to be between 4% and 6%, which is 500 to 700 basis points better than last year. Approximately 400 basis points of improvement is driven by the lap of the nonrecurring inventory charges. And this is almost completely offset by the anticipated volume declines and associated deleverage impact. The additional margin expansion is driven by a combination of favorable product mix due to less close-up volume, supply chain cost savings more than offsetting inflation, reduced complexity across the network, and operating expense reductions.', 'Margin will also be positively impacted from the work on SKU elimination and design the value, which I mentioned earlier. For entertainment, stripping out the impact of the eOne divestiture, revenue will be down approximately $15 million versus last year. And operating margin will show significant improvement driven by operating expense reductions, as well as lapping the impact of the D&D movie impairment in 2023. We will continue to report entertainment as a separate segment for 2024, albeit on a much smaller base.', 'As part of the 2024 guidance, we are increasing our gross cost savings target through 2025 from the $350 million to $400 million communicated in December to $750 million. Through 2023, we have delivered approximately $220 million of gross cost savings and anticipate a sizable step up as we move through the next two years. Roughly half of the gross cost savings will drop to the bottom line as we focus on improving profitability and the remaining dollars will be reinvested back into the business to support growth initiatives including the reinvigoration of toy innovation and the continued investment in the gaming business. With the improvement and operating margin across all segments, Total Hasbro Inc.', 'EBITDA is forecasted to be $925 million to $1 billion, up $215 million to $290 million versus the prior year. The positive impact from the cost structure reset, as well as the lack of the one-time inventory cleanup in 2023 is more than able to offset the revenue decline and cost inflation. We are planning for relatively flat-owned inventory levels in 2024 and estimate approximately $225 million of project capital to support growth initiatives and invest back into the infrastructure as we continue to rebuild the underpinning of the operation. Ending cash will be slightly down versus 2023, driven by relatively flat-owned inventory levels, increased capital project spending, and additional costs associated with the restructuring actions announced in December.', ""From a capital allocation standpoint, our priorities remain to first, invest behind the core business. Second is to return cash to shareholders via the dividend and third to continue progressing toward our long-term leveraged targets and pay down debt. As you heard Chris mention, we remain committed to our category-leading dividend and believe that the changes that we've made within working capital to free up cash, as well as the changes we're making on the broader cost structure, provide enough cash flexibility to deliver on the capital allocation priorities. The board has declared our next quarterly dividend payable in May and keeping consistent with industry best practices as we move through 2024, we will be shifting the declaration of the dividend to more closely align with the record dates."", ""And to close, looking out beyond 2024, we expect that the Consumer product's business will return to low single-digit revenue growth and that Wizards will return to mid to high single digit revenue growth. With our step-up in cost savings, we remain committed to getting to 20% operating margin with the potential to reach that milestone before 2027. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris to wrap up."", 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Gina. Turnarounds take time. And for our toy business, we are still in the early innings. While we're likely to face some near-term industry headwinds in 2024."", ""And we're comping a better than planned 2023 for Wizards. The work we've done under the hood to strengthen our balance sheet, upgrade our planning and right size our inventory is a strong foundation to build from. I want to thank the teams at Hasbro for driving this and putting our fans first. This year is all about execution."", ""As we build on that foundation, drive our profitability, and reinvigorate our innovation pipeline for category share gains in 2024, and renewed top-line growth in 2025 and beyond. We'll now pause to take your questions."", '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] Our first question will be from the line of Eric Handler, ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.', 'Eric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- Analyst', 'Good morning and thanks for the question. A lot to digest here. I wonder if you could talk about what the retail situation and your cost structure look like international versus North America?', 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I think perhaps Gina and I will answer this question. Good morning, Eric. Generally speaking, we're feeling pretty good about where our retail situation is."", ""In the U.S. and Europe, in terms of retail inventory, we're down about 20% year over year. That translates to about a four-week improvement on the supply. So between Europe and the U.S., we generally have about 17 to 20 weeks of supply at our major retailers, which is about what we'd like to see."", ""It's about what our normal is pre-pandemic. So generally speaking, that means we neither see retail inventory as a tailwind nor a headwind, which is nice because over the last year or so, it's been decidedly a headwind as retailers have been trying to right size their inventories. I think if we have any concerns inside of retail, it's that there's still a lot of industry discounted merchandise, particularly in what we would call the growth channel or kind of like value resellers. That's going to take a quarter or two to work through."", 'But again, based on our inventory position, we have very little aged inventory and any aged inventory we have has a PO associated with it. So we feel in a generally good position. Gina, anything to add?', 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', 'No, Eric, the second part of your question about the profitability between North America and our international markets. I mean, North America is our highest margin market. Within international, a couple of things that draw that margin profile down. One is within the allowances and just how we intersect or interact with the retailers.', ""That is a bit more costly than what we have in the US. And the second piece is really within our overhead structure to support the international business. Both of those pieces we are working to address. So through our initiatives of revenue growth management, that is squarely focused on all of that cost that's sitting between post revenue and net revenue."", ""And then, the second piece on overhead, all of the cost savings initiatives that we've put into motion will start to attack the cost structure of rather North America, as well as the international."", 'Eric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- Analyst', ""Great. And then, just as a follow up. Chris, you've talked before about being the inevitability that MAGIC has to see slow down. just because of law of large numbers in revenue."", ""And D&D was supposed to pick up the torch and drive higher growth. I wonder if you could talk about maybe some of the key drivers with D&D that as you look at over the next few years, where what's going to build that business even more?"", 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yes, for sure. So last year, we were fortunate in that both MAGIC and D&D were growers for us. The MAGIC tabletop business was up probably in the 3% to 5% range. We had a little bit of attrition on digital, but still the business was up low single digits.', ""And D&D was up over 75% on a total brand basis. I think the contributors for D&D's growth last year will be very similar to what they'll be moving forward. We continue to think D&D Beyond was an excellent acquisition. It really is the way increasingly people are playing tabletop role-playing games."", ""I think it's an excellent platform for us to build upon and expand the ways that people can play, the ways that people can experience theater of the mind. And also for us to distribute and showcase a more diverse set of content, whether that's Universes Beyond style content, like we do with MAGIC, or our major creators content or user-generated content. So I think you'll see more from that on the tabletop side. We continue to have a robust entertainment slate on D&D that we're working with several partners behind, notably the new streaming series from Paramount that we're partnering with them on."", ""And then, video games will clearly be a huge leg up on the D&D business. Baldur's Gate III is one of the seminal role-playing games of all time. It's won multiple games of the year awards. Our partners at Larian really knocked it out of the park with that and were fantastic to work with."", ""Baldur's Gate III is just the first of several new video games that will be coming out over the next five to 10 years that I think will continue to power that franchise. And really, I think the three combined, continued innovation on tabletop, powered by D&D Beyond, targeted entertainment, working through partners in an asset-light model, and then great video game content through licensees and through our own internal studios. I think the future is bright for that brand."", 'Eric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.', 'Christopher Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Thanks, and good morning. So, first a clarification. Did you say you expect consumer products to be flat in 3Q and then up in 4Q in that mix? How are you thinking about NERF growing again? And to what extent are you taking in a shorter holiday calendar next year? And as a part of that, fourth quarter question, could you mention what the specific lift in 4Q '23 was from clearance sales?"", 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""All right. I will try to dissect all of those for you, Chris. So you've gotten the phasing generally right within CP. So as we think about the guide of seven to 12 down, you're going to see steeper declines in Q1 and Q2, similar to what we saw playing through Q3, kind of the average what we saw playing through in Q3, Q4."", ""As we look at Q3 of '24, we start to stabilize as we move into Q4, we're planning for growth. As we think about which brands are going to carry it, it's really behind the strong innovation that we're putting in, NERF being one of them. So we do have some innovation that's coming. That will be a market kind of in the back half of the year as we head into holiday."", ""In terms of your last question on the lift specifically from closeouts, I don't know that I have that number to an exact extent. What I would say is that our closeout volume and revenue was generally consistent with what we saw play through the year prior. There wasn't a huge, a huge delta from previous years. And then, couple that with all of the efforts that we took to clean up inventory as we're looking here in the front part of the year, we're seeing that closeout volume come down quite significantly."", 'So nothing I would call out as different as we played through Q4.', 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', ""As you think about the back half, Chris, I'd be really looking at Beyblade X as a huge launch for us. It did many orders of magnitude larger in the launch in Japan last year versus Beyblade Burst from 2016. We're expecting it to be quite a runner and the early feedback from the toy fairs is our retailers are getting behind it as well. We have some really cool innovation across price points for Play-Doh that I think will continue to the run on that brand, both building share and building point of sale and sell-in."", 'And then, we have quite a lineup of board games that will be coming out throughout the year. But generally speaking, we have a good Q4 for our board games and we think this year will be no exception.', 'Christopher Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Got it. And then, on the MAGIC business, because how many of the larger releases that you mentioned, would you expect could eclipse $100 million? And then, from a Universes Beyond perspective, was there any shift into '24 from IP partnerships that you were expecting in '23? Thank you."", 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. So last year, we did six premier sets per year, which is like large sets that go across formats. I think last year five of our six premier sets eclipsed $100 million. I don't think we have a specific forecast for each of the premier sets this year, but we will have six sets this year."", ""We think actually we'll have probably slightly less kind of secondary sets or secondary SKUs associated with MAGIC. And so, we're projecting flat to slightly down for the brand. So I think you can do the math and say it's roughly about the number of equivalent sets that are hitting that $100 million bogey. As you think about Universes Beyond, last year we had our first what we would call premier set for Universes Beyond that was Magic Lord of the Rings."", ""That did over $200 million in under six months. This year we have some smaller Universes Beyond sets. The first one's going to be fallout, which will come up in March. That won't be at the same scale or size, but we'll do better than what a typical commander set would do."", ""But starting in 2025, we're going to have two premier Universes Beyond sets as part of our mix. And we believe the brands that will be shipping in 2025 have the same kind of carrying power as the Lord of the Rings. The one that we've announced will be in the front half of the year, and that's Final Fantasy, which is just a juggernaut in role-playing games. We've announced partnerships with a host of other brands, Marvel being one of the last ones that we kind of talked about."", ""There'll be multiple sets associated with that. So for '25 going forward, you should expect to see as part of our six premier sets per year, two of them will be Universes Beyond branded. And we think we'll have a similar uplift to what we experienced with Lord of the Rings. And so, that's underlaying a lot of our bullishness on the growth for MAGIC."", 'Christopher Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'Our next questions are from the line of our Arpine Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.', 'Arpine Kocharyan -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So EBITDA finished the year at around $700 million, and you expect around $250 million of incremental cost base in 2024, but then you're probably annualizing cost base from 2023 with some kind of underlying decline in EBITDA. Could you just maybe bridge to the puts and takes of 2024 EBITDA guides for the year for us, because there's also cost to those cost savings, as I understand, if you could just go through the puts and takes."", 'And then, I have a quick follow up for Chris.', 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Got it. Sure. Very happy to do so. So if you kind of name some of them, we think about the build from where we stood in the $750 million.', 'Keep in mind that we have that one time, all those non-recurring charges come back. That is the benefit to us next year. That becomes a tailwind. Almost completely offsetting that tailwind, though, is the volume coming down, the revenue coming down.', ""So the one-time benefit is offset then by the volume kind of delev impact. Overall, we have supply chain productivity that is going to be offsetting inflation. So when you think about the cost save, that's one piece of the cost save, supply chain productivity. The second big piece really is what's happening within our operating expenses."", ""So when you think about the people cost, as well as just broader managed expense savings, that becomes an adder back for us as we think about 2024. And the last piece that is positive is just the overall mix of our business. So not only within WATCI where we have this continued mix into digital, but within the CP business as well, when we again took out those actions from a closeout standpoint, the volume that we're going to be moving through in 2024 is higher profit volume for us. So those are some of big puts and takes."", ""Really the big negative for us as we head into '24 is just what's happening on the revenue line and the impact that that's having."", 'Arpine Kocharyan -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Great. Thank you. And then, Chris, you have talked about $500 million of D&D business over a three-four-year period. I was wondering if that's still the guidance for D&D."", ""I know you addressed some of that earlier, but if you could just go over kind of the long-term growth prospects for that business in terms of sizing it for us, similar to how you guys communicated in October analyst day. So kind of, I know you're not ready to update that guidance, but just sort of, is that $500 million still the right numbers to think about? Thanks."", 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yes, no worries. Hey, Arpine, by the way, I heard you have a new child. Congratulations.', 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', 'I think I just heard the baby.', 'Arpine Kocharyan -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Thank you. I appreciate it.', 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', 'We always appreciate it when people make customers.', 'Arpine Kocharyan -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Indeed.', 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', ""I would say that guidance holds. The D&D brand and our games portfolio overall is trucking along at a similar pace as we expected. That guidance was more of a 2027-ish timeframe. I think a little bit will depend on certain calendars associated with certain video games and there's a certain amount of schedule slippage that you get with that."", ""But generally speaking we feel good about the trajectory of the brand and as I mentioned in Eric's question kind of like the three core pillars that underlie it."", 'Arpine Kocharyan -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Megan Alexander with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.', 'Megan Alexander -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Hi. Thanks very much and thanks for all the detail. It's really helpful. I was wondering, Gina, if maybe we could unpack the revenue guidance for consumer products just a bit more."", ""You cited those four points from exiting the licensing. Maybe you can help us understand what's implied from an industry POS expectation and I guess is the comment that retail inventory is not a headwind or a tailwind. Should we assume that you're just kind of shipping in line with POS?"", 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, that, good question Megan and that's where I was going to lead you. Just especially given where our inventory positions are sitting, our assumption that we're making is that our shipment is going to more closely align with POS. In fact, we actually started to see that happen toward the tail end of this year. So do you think about the guide that gives you an indication of how we're thinking about the broader macroenvironment."", ""So you take those, call it roughly four points out for just the business exit. You're laxed with down three to eight. In the down three scenario that would be us over delivering and getting share and beating the market. Down eight is probably more similar of us moving in line with the market."", ""But I think you've got the equation right that our shipments are going to more closely kind of align with our line of POS."", 'Megan Alexander -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""OK. And then, could you maybe quantify the net cost savings that are embedded in the guide? I think for your slides you're going to get to kind of $500 million of gross cost savings by the end of this year. You've kind of said you haven't really seen any last year. So on that call it net, $250 million if you can reinvest 50%."", ""What's embedded this year? And I know you talked about some cost inflation. Is that freight? Are you still seeing, product inflation, whether it's things like resin? Can you just maybe quantify what is actually embedded in the guide?"", 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure, absolutely. Let me start on that -- let's start on the inflation side first. I know we'll work our way back. So embedded in the guide is roughly an inflation rate of 3%."", ""The single biggest inflation driver for us this year will be labor. Labor within manufacturing and labor within the broader logistics network. We're also seeing some inflation like in resin, you're pointing, that's our single biggest kind of component that we're purchasing. We are seeing that inflate and then fuel."", ""So I think between those three pieces, you're roughly getting to 3%. We believe we have cost productivity that more than offsets all of that. So specifically within kind of our cost of goods, we will be a net margin contributor because we -- how that will play out. In terms of the total gross sales cost save, I think it's fair to say that roughly, call it $200 million, $250 million will be net cost saving between this supply chain cost productivity offsetting inflation, as well as all of the moves that we're making below the line within managed expenses, whether it be people cost coming down or just broader purchase expenses coming down."", 'Megan Alexander -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Great. And just to clarify that that $200 million to $250 million is, that's a net tail end verse '23 and that's kind of should be independent of whether the top line's kind of above or below or at the high end of the low end of your guide."", 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""That's right. Yes, that's right."", 'Megan Alexander -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.', 'Andrew Uerkwitz -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I want to stick with Wizards of the Coast. If I think beyond 2024, what kind of cadence would we have in digital games? We saw two big games last year.', 'No new ones this year as far as we know. Like what kind of cadence should we expect there on the digital game side? And any clue on the mix between mobile and traditional PC console?', 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey, Andrew. Yes, I would say for starting in 2026, we'll probably have one major new digital game that we'll publish. And then, '27 to '30, it'll be anywhere between one to two, depending on how the schedules kind of shake out. From a licensing perspective, I think you should generally see our licensing business after taking maybe a little bit of a step back this year, just given the Baldur's Gate III launch bulge."", ""Take a little bit of step back this year, but then it will grow sequentially every year as we just expand the number of licensors and games like Monopoly Go! continue to mature and become more profitable for us. We're constantly adding new licensors to the mix, so it's a little difficult to give you a lot of precise guidance about kind of like the mix between mobile or kind of like some of like the casino gambling that we that we also licensed to or PC and console. But generally speaking, our license mix tends to be more mobile and casino gambling than it would be PC and console because that's where we're going to tend to focus our publishing efforts."", 'Andrew Uerkwitz -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Got it. That's very helpful. And then, on the Universes Beyond sets coming beyond 2024. Is the goal there with Marvel and Final Fantasy to find new audiences to kind of better monetize your current audience or even maybe flip it around a bit? You're great in competitive."", ""I think you're very good in kind of social gaming, but that collector spot of kids just buying cars for fun. Like where are you trying to really target with some of these Universes Beyond sets with Final Fantasy and Marvel?"", 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, I think it's generally speaking all the above. However, I think the special emphasis for Universes Beyond is new player growth. The Lord of the Rings was by far and away the most successful product at bringing in new players into the franchise that we've ever released. We would anticipate that would be the same or potentially even greater for IPs like Lord of the Rings or Marvel or some of the future things that we have in store."", ""So, it's a great way for us to kind of expand the base of users and grow kind of like future sets over time."", 'Andrew Uerkwitz -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Got it.

So as we head into '24, we're rebuilding, we're building now."", 'Jaime Katz -- Morningstar -- Analyst', ""OK. And then, Gina, I don't think it's been delineated what portion of the cost savings are coming out of cost of goods sold relative to SG&A, my suspicion is most of it's out of that SG&A line. But do you have that bifurcated and an easy way to digest? Thanks."", 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, my very simple would say, yes, you're right, it's about half and half, if I'm looking at the big buckets. And then, a little bit that we did in '23 on royalty expense, but it's really small change compared to the cost savings we're driving within supply chain and within the managed or operating census. So almost -- it's almost half and half."", 'Jaime Katz -- Morningstar -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Jason Haas with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.', 'Jason Haas -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious if you could say what our POS was for you guys in 4Q? And then, I'm also curious, it sounds like you're expecting the industry could be down as much as 8% in 2024, but then expect it gets back to, I think you said low single digit growth thereafter."", ""So I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on why you think the industry will be down so much and then what needs to change to get it back to growth."", 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, hey, good morning, Jason. In Q4, we were down around 12% or 13% on our internal point of sale measurements. When you factor out some of the exited licenses that we didn't comp, it was more down around negative 9% in the quarter, which roughly tracks around what the industry did. We think the industry did between negative 9% and negative 10%."", ""For the full fiscal year, we were down negative 10% to negative 11% based on our internal point of sale tracking and kind of exited brands. We were down about negative 6%, which again, roughly tracks with kind of what our feeling is for the industry. In terms of our call for industry trends moving forward, I think generally speaking, we think the prevailing trends that existed in the back half of 2023 are likely going to persist into at least the first half of 2024 and probably into the second half of 2024. We still have a little bit of a correction from pre-COVID kind of toy share of wallet that we think we're experiencing in markets like the U.S."", ""We do see growth in places like Latin America and Southeast Asia. And we generally are kind of thinking that once we get through 2024, we're largely past that kind of post-COVID correction and we start getting back into a toy market, which from our planning purposes, we're basically projecting to be around flat and that based on our innovation and the marketing that we're putting together and just the general kind of fundamental health of the business that we're reinjecting into it, that we can grow at that level or likely ahead of that level and build some share, particularly in the categories we're focused on."", 'Jason Haas -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Got it. That's really helpful. And then, a follow-up. I was curious if you could help size up how much Baldur's Gate III and Monopoly Go! contributed in 4Q? I need to get some color on it for 2024, but just, yes, just curious."", 'Any more color on what those two contribute as we go through 2024 would be helpful.', 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""As we move through 2024, yes. For Monopoly Go! in Q4, it was just the minimum guarantee that we booked in from a revenue standpoint. And Baldur's Gate had another healthy quarter, I think for the year in totality, Baldur's Gate was around $90 million of revenue. So now that you turn the corner into 2024, the front half of the year, you're still going to have the tail from Baldur's GateI II."", ""That's going to stay with us all year. Obviously, not at the same extent that we saw played During Q3 and Q4, but we'll still be selling units and making revenue and profit off of that product. From Monopoly Go! what gets interesting is that based on our forecast, based on how well the game is doing, as we get into the back half of the year, we believe we'll be able to start booking revenue and profit ahead of our minimum guarantee. We don't get into the terms of the contracts and kind of what that royalty rate is, but suffice it to say, as we think about the comp that we're up against and Monopoly Go! in the back half, Monopoly Go! is going to almost get there."", ""Not quite get there, but almost get there and kind of offset the headwind that we have from Baldur's Gate."", 'Jason Haas -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Got it. That's helpful. Just a quick clarification. I think you said earlier that you're expecting, I think you said digital game licenses, I think you said it was it's going to be flat year over year so is that right the full amount of Monopoly Go! And Baldur's Gate III and 2024 should roughly be equivalent to what we saw in 2023."", 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. I think you're saying that right."", 'Jason Haas -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'OK. Great. Thanks.', 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Jason.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Linda Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your questions.', 'Linda Weiser -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst', 'Yes. Hi. So I guess I took from your comment that you said that cash balance would be down in the end of 2024 versus 2023. I take that to mean that operating cash flow minus capex minus dividends will be negative.', 'Am I reading that correctly? Do you have a guidance number or range for operating cash flow like you usually give, for 2024?', 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I mean, we haven't officially made a guidance, but it's going to be, operating cash flow is going to be slightly down versus where we landed the year, strictly because of the inventory benefit that we got. We capture that as part of our '23 cash flow. In terms of ending cash, it's slightly down. I mean, you could almost argue that ending cash is going to be relatively flat year over year, but I mean, it is slightly down and it's slightly down because we're stepping up our capital expense a little bit and then we also have additional charges related to the announcements that we had in December that play in."", ""But no, we don't get to negative, negative free cash."", 'Linda Weiser -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst', 'So can you help me understand the change in cash taxes paid and also the change in outflow related to cash restructuring in 2024 versus 2023?', 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""The cash, I'm going to have to follow up with you on the cash tax in terms of the cost for restructuring. We paid roughly, I would say, oh, it's $78-ish million in as we move through '23 and as we move into 2024, that's going to be roughly, call it $100 million."", 'Linda Weiser -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst', 'OK. That would be for cash restructuring, things like severance and other cash costs.', 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Correct. That's right."", 'Linda Weiser -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst', ""OK. And then, I know that you really want to protect and continue to pay the dividend, but one might argue that Mattel's turnaround really started when they cut the dividend because it gave them, a little bit of flexibility to work down the debt. You really didn't state any leverage targets for 2024 or 2025. Your stock is trading as if the dividend is not safe."", 'So, one might argue that it would really benefit shareholders to at least reduce the dividend so that you could work down the debt a little bit faster. Can you just respond to that idea?', 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I'm going to go back to our prepared comments and both Chris and I remain, and our board remain supportive of our capital allocation strategy, which includes the dividend. And we believe the actions that we've taken both in '23 and '24 to free up cash, support those capital allocation priorities. I hear your point on the delev and getting to those targets faster. We're still committed to getting to those delev targets."", 'We think, though, that fixing the business also is going to free up our ability to hit all of our cap allocation priorities.', 'Linda Weiser -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst', ""And then, just my next question is just more operational. I guess one of the things that kind of went wrong, I guess you could say, in 2023 is that the industry POS slowed a lot in the second half, or it wasn't what you would have thought, and that was the same for Mattel. So is there anything about 2024 that if the industry actually gets worse, versus what you're projecting, is there any flexibility or levers that you can use to better reach your financial goals in 2024, even if the industry ends up being different than you thought?"", 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, I would say our projection for the industry is probably on the more cautious side than what most independent analysts or other toy companies would have. So I think we're going in with the cautious outlook. I also think we have a lot of tools in our quiver in terms of cash liquidity. We've got $1 billion, $1.8 billion of cash liquidity in options."", ""Should we have to get, whether a down quarter or two, that is worse than what we're predicting. And our new management team, I think, is showing quite indebtedness at cost management and supply chain management. So there are levers that we have to pull. We feel quite confident in our ability to execute against our capital allocation priorities, which are investing in the business for long term growth, continuing to give money back to shareholders via our dividend and in achieving our long term deleverage targets, which is 2.5 or less."", 'Linda Weiser -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you. Good luck with everything.', 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Linda.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.', 'Stephen Laszczyk -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Hey. Great. Good morning. One on long term margins and one on capex.', ""Maybe first for Gina on margins, just given the new cost efficiency targets, could you update us on your view for what you think the medium to long-term margin opportunity in consumer products is and maybe the path to get there beyond the four to six you guided in 2024? And then, just on capex, you called out the $225 million in a capex for this year. Could you just unpack a little bit more in terms of what that's being invested into and maybe what you think the long-term outlook for capex is on an annualized basis beyond some of the initial programs? Thank you."", 'Gina Goetter -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Got it. OK. Good question, Stephen. And so, on margins, overall for the company, we remain committed to getting to that 20% midterm target that I think we put out there at our last investor day.', ""As you break down the CP number, we have a lot of momentum on the margin side as we head into this year. I believe as we turn into '25 and '26, we're continuing to refine, what's happening within our supply chain, what's happening within our cost structure, so that will provide some up list on the margin. But the single biggest thing that's going to help us keep moving to the 10s, to the teens and beyond, on toy, is really volume in our -- in getting back to growth, putting innovation in market that is actually growing our business. That leverage benefit will have the kind of the single biggest impact on that margin line."", 'So I think we have a good line of sight to the margin targets that we put out there for this year. For next, we are anticipating that our margin is going to grow again. The speed with which we move up that scale will really be dependent on how fast we can get over the growth count. In terms of capex, that step up that we are seeing this year really is being driven by our investment in digital games.', 'If you think about that breakdown of $225 million, there is roughly half of it goes into our Wizards business. Another I would say, half of that half then is going back into our toy business with the remaining piece that is going into our broad infrastructure. So we are continuing to build capabilities both within just kind of the underpinning of the organization when you think about IT and systems, as well as within our broader supply chain.', 'Chris Cocks -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yes, and just for strategic context, Steven, and thanks by the way for being the anchorman on the questions for us. Our investments in digital and digital gaming, they are foundational to the future of the company. It is something we have been investing in for the last seven years. It is something that I think you should anticipate that we will at least maintain if not grow over the next three to five years.', ""It is going to be a material source of value creation, particularly in the game side of our business moving forward. I think we already see that it can work and work fantastically well with what we have been doing with licensing partners, particularly with Monopoly Go! and Baldur's Gate III last year and great acquisitions like we made with D&D Beyond. And I think you are going to see more and more value creation as we go through '24, '25 and into '26."", 'Stephen Laszczyk -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Great.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Josh."", 'Josh Charlesworth', ""Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm so excited for what is ahead of us at Krispy Kreme. Our strategy is clear to make our fresh doughnuts available in more places and keep reminding people of the joy that is Krispy Kreme, but a treat to share and give to others. We made great progress on this in 2023, with strong consumer demand and increased access to our fresh doughnuts in both existing and new markets around the world. We also improved profitability as we grew, demonstrating the productivity benefits of our unique hub-and-spoke operating model.As we move forward in 2024, we will continue to offer new and exciting specialty premium doughnuts, upgrade of digital commerce capabilities, and expand the availability of our doughnuts around the world, including in our newest sales channels like club stores and quick service restaurants. We will also increase our efforts to modernize the making and moving of doughnuts to ensure we deliver high-quality profitable growth.Let me summarize today's key messages. We continued to deliver double-digit organic revenue growth, with all markets and channels growing sales. We expanded profit margins by leveraging existing production hubs to support our growth, especially in the US, where operating leverage was strongest. Our ongoing strategy is to scale the business efficiently, providing more fresh points of access. There are now more than 14,100 places where you can buy our melt-in-your-mouth fresh doughnuts in 39 countries. Our focus on operating excellence means that we're building both a bigger and better Krispy Kreme business. And finally, we are introducing our 2024 outlook, with organic growth expected to translate into adjusted EBITDA expansion, reflecting our intent to drive increasingly profitable growth.We delivered 13.2% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, ahead of our guide, and 12.2% organic revenue growth for the full year. This performance reflected strong consumer demand, with people choosing to celebrate Halloween, Thanksgiving, and the holiday season with premiums-priced specialty doughnuts from Krispy Kreme, including a Scooby Doo dozen and our first-ever Elf doughnut collection, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the family-favorite holiday movie.Times like this help create tremendous excitement for the brand in 2023. And we finished the year with over 40 billion media impressions, reflecting how well Krispy Kreme's fresh and innovative doughnuts resonated with the consumer. E-commerce also continues to play a bigger role within our business, growing over 25% in the fourth quarter, driven by new loyalty members, which now total over 15 million, as well as operational improvements to our website, app, and in-shop availability.Organic growth was also driven by adding new points of access, which increased by 743, a much stronger fourth-quarter expansion than in prior years, reflecting the growing demand from existing and new partners who want to make everybody's favorite fresh doughnuts available to their customers. The same goes for new countries, with Krispy Kreme opening in Ecuador and France in the fourth quarter, to add to Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Switzerland, Chile, and Costa Rica, which were all added earlier in the year.The continued expansion of our hub-and-spoke model delivered productivity growth and increased profitability in the fourth quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margin improving 40 basis points to 14.2%. The hub-and-spoke model is becoming more productive as we add more points of access without adding significantly more production hubs. We ended 2023 with 2,300 more points of access than in 2022, mostly to deliver fresh daily displays in grocery and convenience stores. And we did this whilst adding net one production hub. The resulting increased utilization of our production hubs, most of which can still make twice as many doughnuts as they do today, made them more efficient and profitable. We also completed the optimization of our production hubs without spokes in 2023, closing legacy doughnuts shops which were not well suited to the strategy.Our fourth-quarter and full-year results exemplify the success and power of a hub-and-spoke model. And in 2024, I look forward to us becoming a bigger and better Krispy Kreme by continuously improving our business operations as we grow. And the number one reason why someone may not buy a Krispy Kreme doughnut continues to be access and convenience. We've more than 2 million locations where we could in theory sell Krispy Kreme, at least in the markets we've targeted. The opportunity to expand availability is big.We have previously shared our long-term goal of opening at least 75,000 points of access around the world, yet this still represents less than 3% of the total addressable market. And we are adding new customers all the time, such as Costco in international markets and McDonald's in the US, where we have been conducting an extended test in Kentucky for much of 2023. Our relationship with McDonald's remains strong, with discussions ongoing about further expansion, and we look forward to providing updates on our quick service restaurant plans through 2024. We also expect to launch Krispy Kreme in three to five new countries in 2024, with several priority markets identified in Europe as well as Brazil, where we just announced an exciting new partnership with the convenience store chain AmPm.We have perfected the art of making our original glazed doughnut over the last 87 years and bringing joy to our consumers across the world. Yet there remains the opportunity to modernize the way we make and move our doughnuts, bringing efficiency to the process whilst maintaining consistent high quality and service levels.We have started 2024 by making changes to our global leadership team to reflect these opportunities. In Angela Yochem, we are adding a new Chief Information Officer with deep digital technology experience across multiple industries. Our Global Supply Chain Leader, Sherif Riad, formerly of Mondelez, has stepped into the team, as our US Business Leader, Javier Rancaño, who has extensive QSR operations experience. As a leadership team, we are focused on quality fresh doughnuts in every channel every day, expanding the use of automated doughnut making and processing, and continuously improving our doughnut delivery capabilities as we support more and more points of access.An example of this is a pilot we are just starting on select routes in LA. and DC to deliver our fresh doughnuts through a third-party logistics provider, still using dedicated Krispy Kreme trucks and drivers. As we focus on our core strategy of producing, selling, and distributing first doughnuts daily, we continue our [strategic view of insomnia cookies]. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremiah to give further insight on our financial performance and provide an outlook for 2024."", 'Jeremiah Ashukian', ""Thanks, Josh, and good morning and strong double digit fourth quarter organic growth and improved profitability for the year, demonstrating the productivity benefits of a hub-and-spoke model. In the fourth quarter, we grew double digits on both the top and bottom line on a percentage basis, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 40 basis points year-over-year to 14.2% is our growth in all our markets, driven by high impact global brand activations of seasonal offerings, increased points of access and premiumization efforts. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14.7%, outpacing our revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter as we continue to realize cost efficiencies occur. The global business. Increased utilization been performed largely in line with expectations as we delivered 12.2% organic growth, increased adjusted EBITDA by 11% and expanded margins.Organic growth accelerated to 13.2% in the fourth quarter. Notably, we saw growth across all our segments in 2023 on top of strong performance in 2022. In US segment, organic revenue grew 13.7% in the fourth quarter, driven by record holiday season, especially Donna offerings drove incremental sales through all channels, especially DFT and have positive impact on our sales. We also observed increased transaction values did a growth of our e-commerce channel.

The hub-and-spoke model first established in the UK and Australia is now well underway in the US for several cities seen marked improvements in profitability during the year as we added more points of access to the existing hubs. This as well as our ability to leverage pricing to offset inflation, explains the increase in sales for hub of 8.9% year over year. And the subsequent 120 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin improvement for the year.In the international segment, organic revenue grew 9% year over year as we expanded points of access and leverage global campaigns over the holiday season to drive volume of our specialty doughnuts. Most notably, we executed our health specialty dominance in nine markets worldwide, leveraging a single set of mark materials seen great results, Mexico and the UK. Mexico was a substantial contributor to growth this quarter. We have nearly doubled points of access in Mexico through existing partners, such as OXO with meaningful room to continue expanding in the country. We also saw successful growth and new partners such as Costco in Australia, which continues to prove to be inefficient.Customer adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially in the quarter to 20.6%, with margin expansion in both Australia and Mexico. Profitability continues to be pressured in the UK, and we're taking actions to improve productivity in the market development segment, organic revenue grew 19.2% in the fourth quarter as we continue our international expansion by opening 126 more points of access or a combination of theaters, fresh shops and DFT doors.We opened two new markets Ecuador in France and expect that these to come trees alone can support one and 2000 further points of access. Most notably, Paris represented a record-breaking launch in the fourth quarter. The shop was our best performing shop worldwide on a sales basis in December.Market development adjusted EBITDA grew 21.1% in the fourth quarter, with margins expanding by 120 basis points to 35.4%. Margin improvements were primarily driven by continued hub-and-spoke efficiencies in our equity on Japanese and Canadian markets.As we continue to expand globally, we expect to see high returns and international franchises, JV structure of the French market as a prime example of our Capital Light model approach, which enables earnings flow through at significant margins for providing the option to take equity ownership of the market in the future.As you heard from Josh earlier, we announced our future entry into Brazil using a similar approach for the year ending 2023. We delivered $0.27 and adjusted earnings per share, driven by improvements in adjusted EBITDA that were offset by higher than expected depreciation and amortization. As we continue to accelerate expansion both domestically and globally. It adds some near cookies and may choice for investments in anticipation of accelerated growth in the USDFD. business.We also saw increased annual interest expense as a result of the higher interest rate environment. As a result, we saw adjusted diluted earnings per share finished lower than our original expectations. Our business fundamentals remain strong. We are confident in our ability to grow EPS despite remaining in the somewhat higher interest rate environment in 2024.In 2023, we deployed some of our operating cash flow to strategically reduce our use of vendor financing, which had an impact on net cash from operations. Over the year, we reduced vendor financing by roughly $82 million, which provide a long-term tailwind of $3 million to $5 million on an annualized basis to adjusted EBITDA beginning in mid 2024. Despite these efforts, we are able to hold leverage flat through 2023, finishing the year at 4.1 times.We have a healthy balance sheet having extended our maturity 2023. We closed the year with just under $40 million in cash and have access to ample liquidity through our revolver with an undrawn capacity of $150. We remain focused on the long-term health of the business and setting up our capital structure to support growth through a strong balance sheet. We expect to deliver in 2024, primarily to the growth of adjusted EBITDA and running the business with an eye towards efficiency and capital expenditures as well as managing working capital over the long term, we remain on track to be between 2.0 times and 2.5 times net leverage in 2026.As we look forward to 2024 for providing our outlook for the full year, which assumes a nominal offerings, including insomnia cookies. For the full year 2024, we expect to deliver net revenue growth of 5% to 7%, organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%. Adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% to 11% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $0.27 and $0.31. After reporting strong double digit fourth-quarter and full-year organic growth in excess of our full year guide.We remain confident in our 2024 guidance and our ability to drive operating leverage as we become more coordinated as a global company, we believe well positioned for sustainable, high-quality growth in the years to come, leveraging the tools, which helped us deliver a great finish to the year in 2023. As it relates to the first quarter, despite the harsh weather and broad parts of the US in January and lapping record-breaking sales in the first quarter of 2023 to 4%, we also expect adjusted EBITDA to grow in line with revenue growth. We will closely monitor and adapt to changes in the market and consumer environment, and I remain confident about the profitable growth potential of our business in 2024, and we're excited for a great year to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Josh for his closing remarks."", 'Josh Charlesworth', ""Thanks, Jeremiah. In summary, we are expanding availability by adding high-quality productive points of access, driving operating leverage to the efficiency of our operating model, and maximizing capital return both by leveraging existing capacity, and making selective investments in geographies which have limited access to Krispy Kreme today. All in, I look forward to us building a bigger and better Krispy Kreme in the years ahead. Operator, let's now open it up to Q&A, please."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Sara Senatore, Bank of America.', ""Hi, good morning, this is Jessica (inaudible), on for Sara Senatore. Thank you. So for last quarter, you said you had an advance quesitons about expanding the McDonald's partnership and were making investments in the US, but it looks like though, 160 or so restaurants testing for doughnuts have been unchanged since 3Q. And I know that the test release alluded to more growth in the quick service restaurant channel, but I want to see if there's any more color you could provide on that agreement. And I do have a couple more questions, but after that, I can ask them one at a time."", 'Josh Charlesworth', ""Sure. Good morning, Jessica. Yeah. Obviously, word is out in the success of our Delivered Fresh Daily doughnut program, several customer opportunities in existing and new channels around the world. Regarding quick service restaurants in the US, our focus does continue to be on McDonald's. Discussions are ongoing and productive about an expanded partnership. And we'll provide an update on that one when we have it. Okay. What was your second question?"", 'So in the US and international markets, revenue growth was slightly less than points of access growth. I know you think in terms of growth in sales perhaps, but as we tried to forecast sales going forward, how should we think about new footprints of access? Is it fair to assume that now have lower volumes than the 16 basis points of access? And also is that driven by the time of door? And will that change if the accelerated expansion into the quick service industry was interesting.', 'Josh Charlesworth', ""Obviously the three international markets, the UK, Australia and Mexico and different situations. The UK Australia, much more developed in the grocery store customer mix in Mexico really really starting out with a big opportunity in in convenience stores and see you get a constant mix affect. The underlying performance is good on that you're going to get these mix effects for for the forecasting, especially in Mexico with the opportunity with the OXO convenience store chain."", 'Okay. Thank you. And could you remind us how much of your commodity basket you have locked in?', 'Jeremiah Ashukian', ""Yes, and I can take that, Jessica. And we started to put on cover on commodities early or in 2023. We do expect to see mid to high single digit inflation overall for 2024 from most of our commodities are now covered. About 75% of them are covered that off commodities that we actually can cover some as it made sense for us from a pricing perspective or just the security of supply perspective from a bit of a mixed bag within that kind of high single digit, mid to high-single digit inflation number amongst our cost structure, as we're forecasting inflation in excess of 20% on things like sugar, where the market remains around 10-year highs and low double digit inflation on things like cartons, which is a commodity we can hedge. But we do expect to see some deflation on key commodities like we and edible oils. I think it's important to note out just outside of commodities from a labor perspective, we do believe that will be subject to the wage increases in California. And as a result, we continue to expect to see high single digit to low double digit inflation on labor in 2024."", 'Okay. Thank you so much for your time.', 'Josh Charlesworth', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.', 'Luke Jobe', 'Hey, team. This is Luke Jobe, on for John Ivankoe. Just wondering if you could give some language around specific changes to the current process or model that were that were focused on was specification to modernization of the dynamic in process and kind of especially delivery within the within. Thanks.', 'Josh Charlesworth', ""Sure. Thanks, Luke. I'll take that and get you picks up on our efforts to modernize the way we made a move. All our doughnuts, like goes all the way from the sort of digitization of the process through to the automation of the doughnut making itself. And then overlay onto upskilling our donor transportation all in, we're working to ensure the freshest doughnuts every time delivered as efficiently as possible.We shared before the automation efforts. We have a line running in New York, which is now automatically feeling top paying and even packing the doughnuts, we're looking to perfectt that and then roll it out in time down. And then regarding the logistics, in particular, the rapid expansion of DFD. means that we're becoming more logistics becoming more and more important.So we announced in today's call that we have a pilot covering select routes and DC. and LA. in that study are expected to take about four to six months. And the purpose of that has to work with a third party providers and see if we can maintain quality and service whilst being able to access new capabilities that they can bring and over time, improve our operations and indeed bring more efficiency. So it's an effort end to end to continuously improve doughnut, making a moving and I will provide updates as we learn more."", 'Luke Jobe', 'Great. Thanks.', 'Josh Charlesworth', 'You bet.', 'Operator', 'Bill Chappell, Truist.', ""Hi, good morning. This is Davis [Holcombe] on for Bill Chappell. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to know, as we saw that your guidance this year for fiscal year '24 includes operations for the iPhone via cookies, but we are or where do you know if you could provide a little bit of color on what the sales guide would be without the inclusion of insomnia equities?"", 'Josh Charlesworth', ""Yes. I mean, number one, we're pleased with the performance of insomnia as the business continues to grow profitably and improve from sequentially. In terms of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA improvement from we opened a record number of because the vagaries in 2023. We also talked about the growth rate at insolvent at 16.3% on the earnings call as well. Um, there continues to be lots of some opportunity on this business to expand both the US internationally. And we do expect it to continue to grow double digit in 2024. But just given the fact that we're in the process, as we said in Q3, we're conducting a strategic review and look forward to sharing more news about it that we can. I think in the last earnings call, I did let everybody know that we operate or the impact on insomnia would have a roughly 100 to 200 basis point impact on the top line."", ""Excellent. Thanks for the color. I'll pass it on."", 'Operator', 'Aisling Grueninger, Piper Sandler.', 'Aisling Grueninger', ""Hey, good morning. So CapEx came in as a percentage of revenue for it for 2023 at 7.2% and the new 2024 outlook, you're targeting seven to eight. We're just wondering how concrete of a number that is, does that include any incremental investments you would need to make if let's say, a QSR partnership was to come to fruition in 2024."", 'Josh Charlesworth', ""Yes, good morning, handling and so on. Our confidence in the DFT opportunity around the world and especially in the US, including QSR and such that we have thoughtfully started making additional investments in manufacturing capacity to support it. For example, we've secured new sites in Miami and Twin Cities and L.A. are all conversions of existing buildings looking to accelerate time to opening to keep up with with demand. And to clarify, though, the investments we're making there in broad support of the expansion DSD overall. So they're not dependent specifically, for example, on McDonald's, but the investments that we very much believe and make a lot of sense for our business going forward and in terms of bringing Krispy Kreme to more people in those in those new channels."", 'Aisling Grueninger', ""Great. Thanks for that. And my second question is on, I think we touched on this before, but it's been Slide 18 of your presentation. It's about average revenue per door per week for international. Just what's the dynamics behind? It's been the decrease year over year is it just opening the CFD. doors and less prime locations than the earlier locations? Or just any color would help things?"", 'Josh Charlesworth', ""Yes, it's a great question. Apds internationally were impacted in '22 by the UK regulations that were put in place that's called HFSS., which required us to move where the locations were in the stores, which had an immediate step down in terms of productivity on moving forward. The APD. per door has been impacted by adding more convenience type locations, but Josh mentioned around play around places like OXO in Mexico, which on average is smaller footprint, which would be a lower kind of dollar per door. So overall, the mix effect there will have a prolonged we believe the APD. will remain fairly flattish internationally kind of moving forward."", 'Jeremiah Ashukian', ""It's I think, a clarifying on the US because actually interesting with APD.s growing strongly we're seeing that we're actually bringing on even more productive new customers and locations. I'm showing that there is a lot of whitespace opportunity in the US And it's interesting international Mexico as an example, where we are leaning in on convenience store in the US is a lot of grocery stores, mass club stores, for example, big opportunities there. So the APT will evolve over time with different types of customers. But all in, we're seeing app continuously productive doors are ones that support our margin expansion plans."", 'Aisling Grueninger', ""Great. Thank you so much for that. I'll pass it back."", 'Operator', 'Thank you again. The floor is now open for your questions. To ask a question, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Glenn Glenn though with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.', 'Dan Guglielmo', 'Thank you for taking my questions. And just going back to the US expansion of hubs. You mentioned Minnesota, California, Florida, and I think New England and upstate New York were also opportunities. So just thinking through kind of those, are there certain areas you see as priorities right now. And are there certain markets that you need to get opened before doing like a national QSR rollout?', 'Jeremiah Ashukian', ""Well, it is a rollout with a customer like for example, MacDonald and 13,000, 14,000 restaurants in the US, we can cover about 6,000 restaurants just with our existing network.So your question goes to the seven or 8,000, assuming you're taking McDonald's is the benchmark that we would need to cover in areas where mostly it's in those areas you described in the country where Krispy Kreme isn't today we our plans are anyway over time to open up in those in those places and reference to either on Miami, these L.A., New England, all the ones you referenced, upstate New York or they're all in our plans. And naturally those that we have already maxed out capacity or we've identified sites to the ones we're prioritizing in the short term.But they all make sense for us. And so we're actually looking across the country and in all those locations. And as we as we build out our plans for DSD and QSR in the future."", 'Dan Guglielmo', ""Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up to that kind of like a modeling question, just around the CapEx spend. So 7% to 8% of revenue guidance for 2024. I'm just thinking about the expansion, and I think you had said $3 million to $6 million for some of those hubs. Is there a cadence we should be thinking about quarter to quarter for the year? Is it going to be pretty evenly spread throughout Com or should it be back-weighted? I'm just trying to get some help there. Thank you. On the CapEx is I mean the hubs themselves are coming online, probably a little more back-weighted than the CapEx itself, though phases different. It doesn't, Jeremiah?"", 'Jeremiah Ashukian', ""And yes, I mean, there's a cash flow from CapEx that will happen here because we spent or at least and decided to deploy capital last year in an effort to retire up and running earlier in the year, some from a modeling perspective, I mean, for the most part, we will follow us fairly uniform spend of CapEx throughout the year as we have in previous years. So it's a fairly consistent number. When you think about a percentage of revenue that will bounce between 7% and 8% for the quarters, it will just bounce up and down between those numbers more or less."", 'Dan Guglielmo', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with CL King. Please go ahead.', 'Andrew Wolf', ""Thanks. Good morning. First, I wanted to ask about the first quarter sales being low in a low trend and tie that to the year because obviously you're looking for a big rebound to more like 6% to 8% to get to the 5% to 7% for the year for the for the Q2 through Q4, a little more in line with what May were. I think the Street was expecting. So could you just kind of flesh out a little bit what you're seeing in the quarter? How much you think is pure weather? Is there anything else going on? Do you have sort of non-weather impacted markets either in the US or Canada and even the other segments that sort of point to sort of some more normalized growth supporting the rebound for the rest of the year?"", 'Josh Charlesworth', ""Yes, I think, Jeremiah, can I can take that? I think I'll probably start off by just saying we're actually pleased with the fact and we'll continue to have to post growth in Q1 after a record Q1 in 2023, 14 consecutive quarters of organic growth as the last time, it didn't grow in the quarter was during COVID. And as a result of some of the UK shutdown or slowdown, that organic growth in the quarter is actually close to 3% to 6% given we'll be lapping the discontinuation of BSTM., as you mentioned, like many others, we saw harsh weather in broad parts of the US in January, leading to lower revenues and a softer start to the year and which also comes up against the comp of 14.4% last year, but also a couple of one-offs to your point and one that insomnia cookies, we have a lap against extended delivery zones that will be in our base, which provided some tailwind last year. And then to a market developed we had a one one-off shift in the timing of some equipment sales in our market development franchise business, which resulted in a higher sales being recognized in 1Q last year. That said, we're excited for Valentine's Day tomorrow, which is one of our biggest sales days of the year, not to mention other key specialty done on offerings over the course of the year. We're definitely committed to disciplined growth in pursuit of the full year guide that I laid out. And we will when you think about from a cadence point of view, lap some other things as we get into Q2 that may go the other way, most notably the MCR outage that we had in the US in Q2 2023, which will help us kind of recover back in Q2."", 'Jeremiah Ashukian', ""As I say I'll add is we're looking we're looking forward to quality sustained growth through through 2024 and Q4 showed once again, the consumer just loves our doughnuts, especially for sharing gifting and special occasions and celebrations like Valentines, as Jeremy mentioned, even when priced at a premium. And we see that in all all sales channels with really quite phenomenal growth recently and in e-commerce in particular. So our consumers engaging with the brand more than ever, and that's that's the US and they are the key backdrop to understanding Krispy Kreme."", 'Andrew Wolf', ""Okay. And if I can just add another follow-up. Just related also to sales. I assume for the year you only have the 160 or so McDonald's stores in there, um, but I guess for the US and specifically, is there any less some of a of a push on sales in any way whether it's not putting up stores, you might have put hubs that you might have put up because you're deferring. And is there any impact on yours? What's in the guidance because you're kind of throttling any part of the US operations back in anticipation of either McDonald's or another QSR?"", 'Josh Charlesworth', ""There's no, there's no throttling back, and it's absolutely the case that the DFD. continues to be a core driver of our growth. And indeed, as I mentioned a moment ago that the queue for additional doors around the world, including the US at a time which has traditionally been problematic for our customers, they want to put it in other seasonal items for this year. They wanted to put in our items and prioritized lifting new doors for Krispy Kreme. So So definitely, no, no throttling back at the same time, we are very focused on improving the quality of our operations, ensuring high quality sustainable growth working, as I mentioned, on making moving doughnuts and continuously better ways. So that naturally means we're very thoughtful as we grow to make sure we have the best points of access and strong hubs, making sure they're set up for future growth.As also mentioned, you know, with many of the doughnut shop still heavily underutilized, Ray will make more than twice the market dominance they do today, most of those lines and getting ready for for growth with QSR and other new channels, is it a lift. And so we're making sure that everywhere we grow. It's in a way that ensures high quality doughnuts presented Freshley's consumer in every channel whilst maintaining productivity and efficiency. So yes, we're certainly working hard on the system, but we're not as such throttling back."", 'Andrew Wolf', ""Thank you. That's really helpful color. I'll pass it on."", 'Josh Charlesworth', 'Thanks. You bet.', 'Operator', 'I would now like to turn the call over to Josh Charlesworth for closing remarks.', 'Josh Charlesworth', ""Well, thank you, everybody.

Experts often recommend prioritizing companies that demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payouts over time. Nevertheless, there is also notable interest among investors in companies offering high dividend yields. Over time, high-yielding stocks and companies with consistent dividend growth have demonstrated comparable performance, showing a close race in their investment returns. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series employs a distinctive methodology aimed at tracking the performance of 100 stocks with high dividend yields across various markets. These stocks are chosen based on their consistent history of dividend payments and strong fundamental metrics. Over the long term, this index has demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains compared to standard benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index achieved an annualized total return of 11.7%, surpassing its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which yielded 10.2% annually.

The study focused on examining monthly and annual value-weighted total returns of non-dividend-paying U.S. stocks and five portfolios consisting of dividend-paying stocks. These portfolios were constructed based on dividend yields. The research tracked the performance of each portfolio from January 1928 to December 2017, with dividends reinvested. Notably, the findings revealed that all portfolios comprising dividend-paying stocks outperformed the portfolio comprised solely of non-dividend-paying stocks over the entire period studied.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MCD.', 'Pullback Due To Earnings: An Opportunity To Jump On The Trade At The Last Hour', ""Let us dive into the reported earnings. The earnings per share (EPS, which is the company's profit or net income per outstanding share) beat the Street's expectations by $0.13 to reach $2.95. This is an impressive 18% year-over-year (YoY) increase, especially for a corporation this large. The reason for the stock drop was the revenue disappointment: revenue missed expectations by $40m. That is a 0.6% miss considering the $6.41B revenue (up an impressive 8.1% YoY as well). Wall Street can be picky and the markets don't forgive even a slight miss. As mentioned, the miss is minimal from a quantitative perspective and couldn't possibly justify the erasal of $6bn of market cap; the nature of the miss may actually be of greater concern. Indeed, McDonald's is an international business with presence all-over the globe. Its ability to adapt its menus to local cultures has truly been the key to the business expansion on all continents, and support the continued growth of the company. Therefore, events outside of the U.S. could potentially have material impacts on the financials. When I looked into the quarterly same-store sales figures in the various regions, the U.S. saw an increase of 4.3% versus 4.45% expected while for the international figure the expectation was higher (4.79%) and missed severely by attaining only 3.4%. The international sales miss is what caused the stock to drop, and the main point of concern is the reason for international sales to drop: the situation in the Middle East, in particular the Israel-Hamas conflict."", ""McDonald's Israeli franchisee caused large controversy on social media after announcing its plans on Instagram to provide thousands of free meals to Israeli soldiers amidst the conflict with Hamas. The announcement was surprising because McDonald's has shown neutrality in conflicts over the years, key to being able to implement itself all around the globe with over 41,000 locations in more than 100 countries. The decision caused large boycotts in Muslim countries with large populations and growing markets, namely Malaysia and Indonesia. The boycott waves reached one of the largest and most profitable market as well, France."", ""The markets sold off the stock for a reason that is, in my opinion, a short-term circumstance and a short-lived event. Even if the boycotts were to continue, there is limited downside as it is unlikely they would intensify going forward (the peak of the boycotts were the days following the controversy). More importantly, McDonald's revenue depends less on its food sales than its real estate business and therefore, further downside from boycotts are mitigated. Harry J. Sonneborn, an early insider in McDonald's, once said, We (McDonald's) are not technically in the food business. We are in the real estate business. The only reason we sell fifteen-cent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue, from which our tenants can pay us our rent."", ""McDonald's is a real estate business first and foremost. Out of the 41,000 plus locations I mentioned earlier, only slightly over 2,000 are operated by the company itself (the remaining ones are operated by franchisees). The company provides the franchisees with the product that the latter will sell to pay the rent to the company. Rental income in 2021 exceeded one third of the total revenue and represented the main source of revenue of the fast-food chain. This is the real moat of the business in relation to its competitors. The premium valuation reflects the quality of the business."", ""Compared with the wider fast-food industry, where competitors like Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) operate, McDonald's is rather richly valued. Based on trailing multiples, the stock keeps getting valued more and more richly over time."", 'Source: TIKR.com', ""Ten years ago, the stock was valued at a total enterprise value of less than 4 times last 12 months revenue and around 10 times Ebitda. We are now at around double, meaning the stock has become twice more expensive than a decado ago. The reason for the growing valuation lies in its moat we discussed earlier. The company has successfully managed to mitigate the cyclical nature of its food business by the fixed part of revenue coming from the rental income of its franchisees. The company's growth prospects have also improved over the years, leading to a premium valuation on the multiples of revenue, Ebitda, earnings and free cash flow, which are all above the sector median."", 'Source: TIKR.com', ""The rich valuation is, in my opinion, also justified by exciting innovations. McDonald's has launched a new concept that has been implemented in a few locations in the U.S. and is named after a little-known mascot of the company from the 1980s: CosMc. This new chain, CosMc, is focused on beverages and snacks and clearly aims to become an undeclared competitor to Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) and Starbucks. The latter has been repeatedly criticized amidst a high inflationary environment to hike prices in an unbearable manner. CosMc has proven to be a huge success in its first open locations: the store has seen the triple amount of visitors per square foot than an average McDonald's restaurant."", ""Last but not least, another exciting innovation is underway with regard to artificial intelligence. McDonald's announced in December a partnership with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google to gradually roll out an AI system throughout 2024 in the U.S. For now, the project is rather secretive with little publicly available information on the project. McDonald's has so far only declared that the aim is to provide to its customers hotter, fresher food and help managers quickly spot and enact solutions to reduce business disruptions. We can assume the AI system will help with orders, perhaps faster processing of orders and also in some ways cover for missing staff. It is not impossible that the implementation of AI could reduce the number of employed workers, leading to increased profitability. These innovations are still in the implementation phase and their positive impact could take months or even years to be reflected in the financials. What is certain is the revenue growth prospects and earnings per share growth estimates continue to improve, as shown below."", 'CosMc and AI are likely to boost revenue growth with a significant outperformance relative to the trendline.', 'The earnings per share is also expected to outperform the 10-year trendline.', ""Despite these great prospects and the fundamentals, my bullish case could be invalidated if McDonald's turns too political. Indeed, the business has been able to expand its presence, making it an unmatched brand - except perhaps by Yum's KFC - because of its ability to adapt to local cultures and consistently brushing off any involvement in geopolitical discussions."", 'Additionally, the new CosMc pilot project and the Google AI partnership are too uncertain to model any increase in cash flow projections in 2024. If they turn out to not be profitable, one or both projects could be a source of increased expenses in 2024.', ""McDonald's is a great business that is valued at a premium to the restaurant industry. In my view, the earnings do not justify the drop the stock has suffered, and therefore presents an excellent opportunity to initiate a position or continue accumulating shares. Despite the cyclical nature of the business, the continuous growth of the number of franchisees and the rental income stemming from them provide a reliable base to the financial health of the company. Exciting pilot projects like CosMc and the Google AI partnership provide comfort that the stock will likely continue being valued richly and the business will continue growing in the years to come."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

And now I'll turn the call over to Chris."", ""Chris Peterson: Thank you, Sofya. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our year-end call. I want to start with a brief recap of the significant progress we have made during 2023 on the turnaround agenda. In June, we introduced and deployed a comprehensive new corporate strategy, which focuses on disproportionately investing in innovation, brand building and go-to-market excellence in our top 25 brands and top 10 markets as part of a clear set of where to play and how to win choices. These choices were informed by a thorough and brutally honest company-wide capability assessment we conducted earlier in 2023 and which unveiled gaps in Newell's front-end commercial capabilities. Following deployment of the new corporate strategy, we proceeded to fully cascade and integrated into business, region, brand and functional strategies to ensure clarity and consistency of direction across all areas of the company."", 'Last month, we announced additional changes to our operating model designed to accelerate progress in key capability areas such as innovation, brand building and go-to-market excellence while driving even further standardization and scale efficiencies across the supply chain and back-office functions. As part of this evolution, we have now stood up a cross-functional brand management organization and for our top 25 brands established multifunctional brand teams, spanning brand management, consumer and shopper insights as well as finance, customer strategy and planning and supply chain functions. This move allows holistic support for each brand, keeps consumers at the heart of all we do and ensures appropriate financial and operational rigor is in place to drive on our ambitions.', ""Building on the success of the One Newell approach with Newell's top four customers as part of the organizational realignment, we centralized domestic retail sales teams under our Chief Customer Officer. Further reinforcing our partnerships, simplifying interactions and allowing for additional joint business plans. We also created a new business development team focused on driving distribution with new customers and expanding categories with existing customers. We expect these changes will enable our teams to better leverage Newell's portfolio of leading brands and critical selling capabilities to accelerate both category growth and Newell's market share while serving as best-in-class partners to our customers. Over an eight-month period, key members of the leadership team and I visited eight of Newell's top 10 countries across North America, Europe and Latin America."", ""These visits reinforced our view that international markets, which accounted for about 37% of Newell's sales in 2023 represent an attractive growth opportunity, particularly if we fully harness the scale benefits and embrace the One Newell go-to-market model. As a result, we are further simplifying and standardizing Newell's regional organizations, which will pivot their focus to commercial delivery, with the goal of accelerating speed, agility, effectiveness and ownership. We've made significant progress upgrading talent across the organization to close skill gaps and accelerate capability build-out. We have now filled the majority of critical leadership positions across the company. The two latest hires to the executive team include a new Chief HR Officer; as well as a new CEO of the Outdoor & Recreation business, who both bring a wealth of relevant experience and knowledge."", ""We are excited to have them on board. We've made significant progress on each of the 18 breakthrough capability projects we chartered as part of the new corporate strategy. For example, we completely reinvented the consumer insights function under a new leader that we brought in last year. We believe this will unlock actionable insights as well as proprietary understanding of consumers and customers so that we can enable superior innovations with stronger claims. We have also overhauled Newell's innovation approach around the biannual review process and put in place a project tiering system that helps identify big bets. Our goal is to launch fewer, bigger and longer lasting innovations that are gross margin accretive. While the health of the funnel is not yet where I'd like it to be, we have made considerable progress, not just on cutting the tail, but also identifying Tier 1 and 2 innovations for the coming years."", ""I'll talk more about these as they come to market. To strengthen our market-leading brands with consistent brand building and compelling brand communications, we've put considerable effort into building brand management into a foundational capability for Newell. In addition to upgrading brand manager talent, we put exceptional performance standards in place with clear KPI-driven expectations for all brand managers. We also rolled out a pillars of competitive advantage framework so that we can evaluate our brands relative to competition, on product performance, brand communications, packaging, omnichannel execution and value. Finally, we implemented a new set of corporate values focused on better serving consumers, increasing accountability, driving a sense of urgency and returning the company to winning in the marketplace."", 'We have been and will continue to move with speed and agility to action our strategy while developing and strengthening the capabilities required to win. Turning to financial results. Full-year numbers were either in line with or ahead of our latest outlook across all key metrics. Sales came in ahead of our expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected U.S. demand. Normalized gross margin improved sequentially each quarter and inflected positively in the back half, driven by record-setting productivity performance and the July pricing action to proactively address situations where unit economics were untenable. Operating cash flow increased $1.2 billion versus 2022, ahead of our forecast as we took out about $700 million in inventory. We continue to drive out complexity ending 2023 with approximately 21,000 SKUs down about 25% year-over-year.', 'We unlocked over $150 million of pretax savings through Project Phoenix, which helped mitigate inflationary pressure on overheads, and we reduced net debt by about $500 million, driven by strong cash flow. While we are pleased with the significant progress in 2023, we are not satisfied with the 12% core sales decline for the business, even as we estimate that close to 80% of it stemmed from category contraction and retailer inventory actions. We are laser-focused on returning the company to sustainable and profitable growth and more broad-based share gains and that is precisely why we have been moving at pace in implementing our strategy. Turning to 2024. We expect the macroeconomic backdrop to remain challenging as consumers remain under pressure and geopolitical uncertainty creates a dynamic operating environment.', ""Our outlook assumes that Newell's categories continue to contract, albeit not as much as last year. We also believe retailers will continue to manage inventory tightly in durable and discretionary categories. Within this context, we plan to drive continued strong progress on the Turnaround Agenda and have established five major priorities for 2024. First, continue to operationalize our new strategy and operating model, unlocking the full potential of the organization and our portfolio of leading brands. This includes fortifying organization, talent and cultural capabilities to better enable meaningful innovation, stronger brand building and operational excellence. Second, improved top line and market share performance on a sequential basis as the capability work starts to yield tangible results in the marketplace."", 'Third, drive strong gross margin and operating margin improvement, building on the progress made in the second half of 2023 by realizing benefits from a scaled and advantaged supply chain via productivity and other efficiency projects while also delivering the anticipated savings from Project Phoenix and organization realignment initiatives. Fourth, continue to delever the balance sheet and improve the cash conversion cycle by driving strong operating cash flow.

The tangible progress on our strategy and turnaround agenda more broadly bolster our confidence that we are taking appropriate actions to strengthen the organization, improve its financial performance and create value for our stakeholders."", ""I'll now turn the call over to Mark."", 'Mark Erceg: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. While core and net sales were better than expected at down 9%. We believe the most important financial story of the fourth quarter is the dramatic improvement achieved in the underlying structural economics of the business as evidenced by a 570 basis point improvement in normalized gross margin versus a year ago. Simply put, the targeted interventions we have made to improve the underlying structural economics of the business, such as the July 2023 high single to low double-digit pricing action on roughly 30% of our U.S. business, primarily in the Home & Commercial segment as well as the reduction in the manufacturing labor force across selected sites are clearly showing up in the financials.', ""The company's fourth quarter normalized gross margin of 32.3% represented a 100 basis point improvement sequentially and the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year expansion despite sustained pressures on volumes. Remember, as Chris mentioned earlier, approximately 80% of our reduction in core sales this year was due to retailer inventory actions and category contraction. The resulting lower volumes when combined with nearly $700 million of inventory reduction, which we unilaterally removed from the system throughout the course of the year had a significant impact on capacity utilization and makes the over 500 basis points of productivity delivered in the fourth quarter by our exceptionally talented supply chain organization even more impressive."", 'On the SG&A front, meaningful savings were also realized with Project Phoenix providing $53 million of benefit in the fourth quarter, which helped partially offset higher incentive compensation and the deleveraging impact on SG&A from a weaker top line. Fourth quarter normalized operating margin increased 280 basis points to 7.7%. Encouragingly, this is the first time normalized operating margin has expanded since the second quarter of 2022, which we believe is another proof point that the right strategy is now in place. During the fourth quarter, net interest expense increased $6 million versus last year to $70 million due to higher interest rates and discrete tax benefits yielded a normalized tax benefit of $10 million all of which brought normalized diluted earnings per share in at $0.22.', 'Importantly, this was considerably better than the $0.15 to $0.20 outlook we previously provided. Turning to operating cash flow. $251 million was generated in the fourth quarter, bringing full-year operating cash flow to $930 million, an increase of $1.2 billion versus 2022. You will recall that at the start of 2023, improving cash flow was our #1 financial priority. So we are very pleased that the team over-delivered on this critical metric despite greater than originally anticipated macro headwinds. Strong cash flow allowed us to reduce gross debt by about $500 million during the year with over $200 million of that reduction occurring between the third and the fourth quarter which helped lower our leverage ratio from 6.1x at the end of Q3 to 5.6x at the end of Q4.', ""Turning to 2024. Expectations have not changed since our last earnings call. We said fiscal 2024 core sales were expected to be down year-over-year and below our evergreen target of up low single-digits, with operating margin expansion ahead of the evergreen target of 50 basis points. Consistent with this, we expect the following for 2024. Core sales and net sales are expected to decline 3% to 6% and 5% to 8%, respectively for two primary reasons. First, we expect our categories on average to contract low single-digits in 2024. While we wish this wasn't the case, we nonetheless view this as a source of optimism since this is considerably better than the high single-digit contraction experienced in 2023. Second, we expect distribution losses and product line exits to exceed distribution gains by about two points due to our business decision to exit some structurally unprofitable businesses."", ""Finally, please note that the two-point difference in expected core versus net sales is driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange and to a lesser extent, category exits. We expect normalized operating margin between 7.8% and 8.2%, which at the midpoint represents a 100 basis point improvement, which is 2x our Evergreen Target, which calls for a 50 basis point improvement each year. The increase in normalized operating margin should be driven by strong gross margin improvement as another year of world-class productivity gains and the annualization of the July 1, 2023 pricing action more than offsets an expected low single-digit headwind from inflation. Having just touched on pricing, it bears mentioning that given the degradation in the company's gross margin level in prior years, we are fully committed to restoring Newell's gross margins to provide the necessary fuel for reinvestment behind the business going forward."", 'However, our guidance does not reflect any significant incremental positive pricing actions during 2024. Within SG&A, we expect overhead costs will be down meaningfully in absolute dollar terms which should stay close to flat as a percentage of sales. The combined savings from Project Phoenix and our more recent organizational realignment should more than offset professional wage and benefit inflation and a series of incremental investments being made to enhance several critical core capabilities required to support our new corporate segment, regional, brand and functional strategies. Despite robust cost control, the anticipated contraction in top line sales we expect to incur in 2024 will keep overhead costs as a percentage of sales elevated in the short term.', ""Outside of overhead expense, advertising and promotion represents the balance of SG&A. We are planning to spend more in both absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of sales as we are beginning to see improvement in our innovation funnel and brand building activity and therefore, have more investable opportunities at our disposal. For 2024, we are assuming that interest expense steps up by $15 million to $20 million and that our tax rate is in the mid-teens. Importantly, this compares to a tax benefit of $68 million in 2023. All in, we expect normalized diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.52 to $0.62. Now we'll be the first to admit that at first glance, this does not compare favorably to the $0.79 per share just recorded. However, once a $0.26 year-over-year tax differential is accounted for, the midpoint of this range represents high single-digit growth versus last year, which we believe represents good progress in our corporate turnaround."", ""For the year, we expect to generate operating cash flow of $400 million to $500 million. This range assumes another meaningful improvement in our cash conversion cycle, just not at the record level achieved during 2023 when nearly $700 million of excess inventory was removed and Newell's cash conversion cycle dropped by 24 days. Our operating cash flow range also includes about $150 million to $200 million in cash restructuring and related charges. Frankly, we briefly considered slowing down some restructuring efforts, but the rates of return associated with Project Phoenix, the network optimization project, the organizational realignment and other initiatives are all so compelling, the decision was taken to aggressively but thoughtfully move forward with a multifront transformation of Newell Brands."", ""During fiscal 2024, we plan to invest about $300 million in capital expenditures, most of which will be spent on high-return cost-saving projects to further improve the structural economics of the business and accelerate the turnaround. While fully funding numerous high-return internal projects, we also plan to reduce our leverage ratio and strengthen our balance sheet with an expected return to a more typical seasonal cash flow pattern, characterized by a use of cash in the first half of the year, followed by meaningful cash generation in the second half, Newell's leverage ratio will likely increase as we move towards the midpoint of the year before dropping to about 5x by the end of Q4. Long-term, we remain committed to achieving investment-grade status and continue to target a leverage ratio of about 2.5x."", ""But in the meantime, we wanted to create additional financial flexibility. So we proactively amended the terms of Newell's revolver, even though we were fully compliant with all covenants at the end of the fourth quarter. As a result of the amendment, which was finalized earlier this week, the revolving facility was converted to a $1 billion secured facility, which we believe provides us with ample liquidity going forward. Free cash flow productivity is expected to significantly exceed our 90% Evergreen Target during 2024. As it relates to the first quarter of 2024, we expect a core sales decline of 6% to 8%, with net sales down 8% to 10% versus last year. Please note that the two to three point difference between our full-year and first quarter core sales assumptions can be largely attributed to a greater impact from net distribution losses due to our decision to exit some structurally unattractive businesses, as well as weaker market share performance at the start of the year as the benefits from the capability build-out should improve sequentially going forward."", 'As with the full-year, the two-point difference in expected core versus net sales is driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange and to a lesser extent, category exits. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect normalized operating margin of 2.4% to 3.2%, which at the midpoint would represent a 40 basis point improvement versus 2023. We expect gross margin to continue to expand versus last year, although not nearly as much as in the fourth quarter, largely due to FX impacts and less favorable capitalized variance adjustments. Total SG&A dollars should be down versus a year ago despite spending more on A&P, but because of the anticipated sales decline, SG&A as a percentage of sales should be up by less than the amount gross margin should expand.', ""After incorporating slightly higher interest expense and a modest tax help, we were looking for a normalized diluted loss per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.09. That said, Q1 is typically Newell's smallest quarter of the year due to seasonality. And as a result, it is not indicative of full-year margin trends. In closing, we believe a great deal was accomplished during 2023, which has laid the groundwork frame much stronger 2024 as part of our multiyear journey to put the organization and the business with the right set of core capabilities, inclusive of sound business processes and cultural attributes required to fully operationalize Newell's new corporate strategy and in doing so, dramatically strengthened the company's financial performance going forward."", 'Operator, if you could, please open the call for questions.', 'See also 16 Most Advanced Countries in Medicine and 13 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) share price is up 99% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 73% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 19% in the last year , including dividends ."", ""On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns."", ' See our latest analysis for American Express ', 'There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.', ""During five years of share price growth, American Express achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.5% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 15% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth."", 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', ""We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of American Express' earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, American Express' TSR for the last 5 years was 114%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""American Express shareholders are up 19% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 16% over half a decade It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with American Express , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", 'If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

See NeuroOne's financial results press release and SEC filings for information regarding specific risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. Except as required by law, NeuroOne undertakes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Ron McClurg, CFO of NeuroOne. Please go ahead, sir."", 'Ron Mcclurg', ""Thank you, operator. Before I begin, I wanted to mention that Dave Rosa, our CEO, had minor surgery which prevented them from being able to present this afternoon, so I will be handling the call. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we continued to make significant progress on our objectives relating to commercialization and product development. First, I would like to remind the audience of our recent milestone achievement of receiving FDA clearance for our OneRF Ablation System, the first FDA-cleared system with an intended use for both recording electrical activity and ablation of nervous tissue utilizing the same device. As previously noted, we submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA in June 2023 for the OneRF Ablation System. And we received a 510(k) clearance from the FDA in December of 2023 for the creation of radiofrequency lesions in nervous tissue for functional neurosurgical procedures. We are very excited to be the first to market this novel technology in the United States and are preparing to initiate a limited commercial launch in the second quarter of calendar 2024. We remain in discussions with potential strategic partners regarding the licensing of the technology for brain ablation procedures, and we expect to reach a decision in the near future regarding our commercialization strategy. We also remain open to commercializing the [vice] directly if we believe it represents the best option for the company. And we are working in parallel on a plan to launch the technology directly. In addition, our team is exploring other applications for the OneRF system to treat pain. We believe that there are additional market opportunities for the OneRF system that we may be able to address, and we will provide further updates in the future. I would now like to provide an update regarding the expanded launch of our Evo sEEG electrode product line with our commercialization partner, Zimmer Biomet. Zimmer continued to strategically open new centers during our first fiscal quarter. Customer feedback remains positive regarding device performance, and we are seeing usage picking up in recent months. We completed full sales force training for Zimmer in January 2024, and we expect to see an increase in Evo sEEG sales and revenue as the launch expands. We believe the launch of the OneRF system will also have a positive impact on customer demand for the Evo sEEG electrode product line. Moving on to our drug delivery program, we have discussed the potential for our SEEG electrode technology to deliver drugs or gene therapies to the brain, as well as record the therapy's impact. During the past quarter, we completed feasibility benchtop testing and an animal study, demonstrating the ability to deliver a therapy, and provide recording capabilities using the sEEG drug delivery system. We are currently in contract discussions with a biotech company regarding their interest in using our device in upcoming clinical studies, and have had discussions with other potential partners. We are excited with the prospects of this technology, and how it may assist the biopharma industry in their drug or gene therapy delivery development, and also its value clinically in current neurosurgical procedures. If we are able to reach an agreement in our current contract negotiations, the technology has the potential to add revenue later in calendar year 2024. Development efforts with our spinal cord stimulation program to treat chronic back pain continued in our first quarter as members of our Physician Advisory Board successfully placed a nine millimeter paddle electrode utilizing a percutaneous placement approach in a cadaver model. Paddle electrodes are similar in concept to cortical or film electrodes. In addition, we completed a preclinical study of the first acute electrophysiology experiment with NeuroOne's lead in a sheep model. Spinal cord stimulation and pain management remain a priority given the size of the market opportunity and the potential competitive advantages of our technology. I would now like to provide a review of our first quarter fiscal year 2024 financial results. Product revenue was $978,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to product revenue of $115,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company had no collaboration revenue in the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to collaboration revenue of $1,455,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Collaboration revenue in 2023 was derived from the Zimmer development agreement and represents the portion of the exclusivity and milestone fee payments that were eligible for revenue recognition during the period. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $3.7 million compared to $3.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. R&D expense in the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.5 million compared with $1.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2023. SG&A expense in the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $2.2 million compared to $1.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The net loss was $3.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to a net loss of $1.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. In December of 2023, the company sold common stock under the ATM offering at an average price of $1.45 per share, and received net proceeds of $1.2 million. As of December 31, 2023, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $2.7 million compared to $5.3 million as of September 30, 2023, our previous fiscal year end. The company had working capital of $3.7 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to working capital of $5.5 million as of September 30, 2023. The company had no debt outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, in January of 2024, the company sold additional common stock under the ATM offering at an average price of $1.46 per share and received net proceeds of $1.54 million. Operator, at this time, I think we can open up for questions."", 'Operator', 'Absolutely. Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.', 'Conner Chamberlain', 'Yes, good afternoon. This is Connor on for Alex. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you maybe speak on the RF generator parts? I know last quarter you mentioned that was one of the holdouts in getting some of these systems placed. Any update on that would be great.', 'Ron Mcclurg', ""One of the -- I think what we may have mentioned in the past was that -- there were some long lead time components and that was the gating factor for us in terms of when we could launch a limited release ofhe device. And we've got those components on order. We are expecting to receive our first units of the hardware, the RF generator itself, by the end of March. And so we are looking at beginning a very limited launch of the product in the second calendar quarter of this year."", 'Conner Chamberlain', 'Got you. And then maybe can you speak on any initial impact on Evo sEEG sales following the OneRF approval? I know you mentioned a step up, and then maybe when can we start seeing Zimmer to fully start launching Evo? Or is there any barriers preventing this full launch?', 'Ron Mcclurg', ""There are no barriers at this time that are preventing the full launch, other than and when we initiated the limited launch, we only trained a portion of their sales force. So as I mentioned during the call, in January, so just last month, we attended their national sales meeting and trained their full distribution network, including distributors and direct employees. And one of the things is kind of gating the rollout is there -- approval by the value analysis committees at each of the hospitals. So that is underway right now. They've got a targeted launch. They're trying to do this in a methodical manner and continue to add new accounts as we go forward."", 'Conner Chamberlain', 'Great. And then one more here. Could you speak towards the progress on maybe a potential partnership? Could this be within the year time span, less or more? I know you mentioned direct as well?', 'Ron Mcclurg', ""Well, we are we are in discussions right now with a couple of potential strategic partners. And if those come to fruition, we will then distribute the OneRF Ablation System through that distributor. If we do not get terms that are favorable or acceptable for the company, we are prepared to go and start distribution on our own. And that's what I meant when I said we are kind of -- we have a dual path right now that we are operating under so that we don't delay, regardless of which direction we go."", 'Conner Chamberlain', 'Thanks for taking my questions.', 'Ron Mcclurg', 'We do want to make that decision before we proceed with the limited launch. So we should have that decision made here in the near term.', 'Conner Chamberlain', 'Got you. Great. Thank you.', 'Ron Mcclurg', 'Thank you, Connor.', 'Operator', 'Okay, we have no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.', 'Ron Mcclurg', ""Yes, thank you, operator. I would just like to say that the company is making great progress toward our goals for fiscal 2024. We're excited by the FDA clearance of the OneRF Ablation System, and pleased with the expansion of Zimmer Biomet's launch of the Evo sEEG electrode, and the related increase in revenue. We continue to make progress on our drug delivery program, and our spinal cord stimulation program intended to treat chronic pain. Altogether, we believe NeuroOne has the potential to add revenue in 2024 beyond just sEEG sales. With contributions coming from the OneRF commercial launch and potential drug delivery partnerships. We hope you will continue to follow our exciting progress. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

Every day investors, analysts, government officials, and members of the press painstakingly go over developments in the energy industry to see if they will have any implications on the global business and economic environments. After all, energy, which constitutes primarily of petroleum products and fuels, is the backbone of the modern day world and without it life as we know would come to a standstill.', ""This also makes energy stocks quite lucrative when it comes to both share price growth and stability. The general trend on the stock market sees sizeable firms primarily preferred for their safety and stoutness since their markets are not as risky as those for other firms, particularly those that belong to high growth sectors such as technology. While this naturally benefits energy stocks, at the same time, should the cards align, then energy stocks can deliver spectacular returns that are furthered and sweetened by juicy dividends due to the billions of dollars in profit that they make each year. If you're wondering which energy stocks are the most profitable and make the most money, wonder no more and take a look at 12 Most Profitable Energy Stocks."", 'As an illustration, consider the largest publicly traded energy companies by revenue. The three largest energy stocks in terms of revenue that trade on NYSE are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL), and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). The most significant year for the global energy industry in recent times was 2022, and it came just a year after energy stocks nosedived as global demand for their products faltered in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The Russian invasion of Ukraine upended the industry as European nations scuttled to find alternative fuel supplies. This saw Exxon, Shell, and Total report record revenues, and their shares jumped in double digit percentages during the early days of the war.', ""Since then, the global energy market has stabilized and energy stocks have come back to earth. Their revenues have returned to 'normal' readings after a bumper 2022, and in 2024, the outlook for the global energy industry has divided the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The IEA's first energy outlook report issued in January 2024 outlined that the agency believes that one of the biggest risks to the global oil industry lies in the escalation of the crisis in the Middle East. What initially started as a devastating attack by Hamas on Israel has now spiralled into a broader low intensity conflict involving the Houthi rebel group attacking global shipping lines and a coalition led by the United States and Great Britain responding by military action. Things came to a head just as the year started after an attack led to U.S. service member deaths and left the world in jitters for a while as it contemplated how the world's most powerful country would respond."", ""On the other hand, OPEC released an unprecedented report that not only remained optimistic but also attempted to stabilize oil prices. The optimism wasn't unprecedented with the body sharing that it expects non OPEC liquids production to grow this year. It also released an oil industry forecast for 2025, a rare announcement that saw OPEC share a 12 month+ forecast for its industry. This was done to make sure speculators wouldn't be able to inject volatility into oil prices, an occurrence that the Saudis believe was responsible for recent weakness in the oil market. OPEC expects that global oil demand will grow by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2025, bolstered by an economic recovery in China."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top energy stocks according to hedge funds, with the notable picks being Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)."", ""A pipeline snaking through a desert canyon, representing a energy's transport infrastructure."", 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the best energy stocks, we ranked the 40 most valuable energy stocks that traded on NYSE and the NASDAQ by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares as of Q3 2023.

Such events involve giving all current shareholders more shares, but without changing the total value of their holdings or their relative stakes in the company. The result is to reduce the value of each individual share.', ""In recent years, some of the world's biggest companies have undertaken these financial maneuvers. Technology giant Amazon and electric vehicle leader Tesla both split their stocks in 2022, and most recently, consumer goods giant Walmart announced a 3-for-1 split that will happen later this month. Investors often are on the lookout for potential splitters because, generally, these companies have done well from both an earnings and a share performance perspective, which can indicate that they have what it takes to excel in the future, too."", 'Which company could be next?

The biotech and partner CRISPR Therapeutics developed Casgevy, a gene-editing therapy for the blood disorders sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia, and it recently earned regulatory approval. Investors took notice."", ""On top of this, Vertex aims to file for regulatory approval of two more pipeline candidates -- one, a product that could ensure its long-term leadership in the cystic fibrosis market, and the other, a medication for acute pain that (importantly) is not an opioid. If they're approved, both could add billions of dollars annually to Vertex's top line. So even after the stock's fantastic performance, the good times may keep on rolling."", ""Meanwhile, Vertex's current cystic fibrosis portfolio continues to bring in billions of dollars in earnings year after year.

After all, certain brokerages don't offer fractional shares -- and some investors may not have the budget to buy Vertex shares at today's price."", ""So, what's the likelihood of Vertex splitting its stock and solving this problem? Well, Vertex has split its stock before, but that was quite some time ago, when the company was a lot different from the Vertex of today. Back in August 2000, Vertex commercialized an HIV protease inhibitor, and the company's pipeline spanned a variety of disease areas that aren't its focus today. When Vertex announced that stock split, it aimed to increase the liquidity of its stock and broaden the shareholder base -- and it succeeded in the near term and over time."", ""Today, Vertex's situation has changed quite a bit, with the company reporting billion-dollar earnings and the possibility of additional blockbuster products on the horizon. While its share price may put it out of reach for some investors, its valuation still remains reasonable. The stock trades for only 25 times forward earnings estimates, and this doesn't take into account earnings potential a few years down the road."", ""Vertex probably doesn't need to split its stock as much as it needed to more than 20 years ago, and with the focus on potential new products ahead, the company may not make this sort of move a priority. Finally, stock splits themselves generally don't boost stock performance -- so such an action wouldn't drive additional gains for investors."", 'That said, a stock split could indeed benefit Vertex and its shareholders by making its shares an easier buy for a wider range of investors, and this means, over time, it might be a valuable move for the biotech giant.', ""What does all of this mean for you as an investor? Vertex may not be the next to announce a split, but for most of us, that's just fine."", ""A stock-split announcement may put an extra spotlight on a top-notch player such as Vertex, and a split may offer a company some liquidity benefits over the long haul. But these events won't result in instant share price gains, and they aren't the only way to find good investments.

The biotech hit gold when it started producing therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare genetic illness that affects patients' internal organs."", ""Here's the great thing: Vertex became the only company in the world to market drugs that treat the underlying causes of CF. Other drugmakers couldn't develop competing drugs for this disease, and it wasn't for lack of trying. Many other biotech companies tried but failed."", ""Since it holds a monopoly in this field, Vertex has substantial pricing power. Further, it has continued to develop newer and better medicines. In 2019, it earned approval for Trikafta, a combination therapy that can treat up to 90% of CF patients.The result of Vertex's highly successful CF-related work has been rapidly growing revenue and earnings in the past decade, and its stock price has also increased by leaps and bounds."", ""So how much would a $10,000 investment in the biotech be worth today? The company's shares have delivered a compound annual growth rate of 17.8%, which would have transformed a starting capital of $10,000 into $51,414. The S&P 500's CAGR over the same period was 12.9%, which would have turned $10,000 into $33,498."", ""That's Vertex's past. But what does the company's future look like? Thankfully, it's likely very similar. Vertex isn't done innovating within its core therapeutic area."", ""It recently reported positive results from a phase 3 clinical trial for a new therapy, which showed non-inferiority to the company's current crown jewel, Trikafta, all with a convenient once-daily dosing. Trikafta is typically taken twice a day. The biotech is racing toward a new approval for this medicine. And it is still developing more CF therapies for those patients who aren't eligible for its existing treatments."", 'However, Vertex is diversifying its lineup. Last year, it earned approval for Casgevy, a gene-editing treatment it developed with CRISPR Therapeutics for a couple of rare blood diseases. The biotech also just reported positive results from a late-stage study for VX-548 in treating acute pain. Vertex is hoping VX-548 can serve as a substitute for opioid-based pain medications that often carry substantial side effects.', 'While its phase 3 results were not as convincing as it might have hoped, at least in this regard, VX-548 should still earn regulatory approval. Vertex also has several other exciting candidates in early-stage studies.', 'So, what can we expect from the company moving forward? First, there will almost certainly be more clinical and regulatory wins in the next few years. Second, the drugmaker is moving to substantially diversify its lineup. Third, revenue and earnings should continue growing at a good clip.', ""All in all, Vertex looks set to continue delivering market-beating returns. Can it register a CAGR of 17.8% through the next decade again? My view is that there is an excellent chance its performance will be in the same neighborhood. There aren't many better biotech stocks to buy than Vertex Pharmaceuticals."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Maybe you just don't have time to ferret out your portfolio's next pick? Whatever the case, there's a simple solution -- borrow an idea from one of the world's most proven investors, Warren Buffett. Or, more specifically, buy one of the names Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway already owns."", ""Here's a rundown of three Buffett-approved picks Berkshire Hathaway is currently holding that would also be at home in most investors' portfolios."", ""To say Coca-Cola\xa0(NYSE: KO) is a well-known brand somehow seems like a serious understatement. It's a market-share leader, domestically as well as internationally. Indeed, now well over 100 years old, the company's become a cultural icon."", ""It's not just its namesake cola anymore, of course. The Coca-Cola Company is also parent to Dasani water, Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Powerade sports drink, and Sprite just to name a few of its other beverage brands. This wide range of products is a big reason Coca-Cola's been able to maintain its revenue and earnings growth for so long even though the beverage marketplace is constantly evolving. (Namely, consumers are drinking less sugary soda and drinking more water and tea.) It's always got something to sell someone."", ""More important to investors, this steady flow of sales and profits is why the company's dividend history is nothing less than stellar. Not only has Coca-Cola been reliably paying dividends every year for decades, but it's also raised its dividend payment every year for the past 61 years. Only nine other companies in existence today boast a longer track record of annual dividend growth."", ""Don't look for any dividend disruption anytime soon either. Aside from being one of the world's most memorable, loyalty-inspiring families of beverage brands, it's also earning more than enough to fund its current and future payouts. Only about two-thirds of its profits are paid out in the form of dividends. The difference provides a cushion against any fiscal turbulence and allows the company to reinvest in its relatively simple business's own growth."", ""There was a time when Berkshire Hathaway simply wouldn't have owned a stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). See, for most of his stock-picking life, Buffett's steered clear of technology stocks, explaining he doesn't invest in companies he doesn't fully understand. That's why Berkshire's 2016 purchase of Apple shares came as such a surprise."", ""Even more surprising is that Buffett has added to the trade in the meantime, as Apple's stock price has grown. The 915 million-share holding is not only about 5% of Apple itself, but now also accounts for roughly half of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio. That's a lot by both measures."", ""The decision probably wasn't all Buffett's. Younger managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler arguably better understand Apple's strengths and weaknesses, and as such were in a better position to suggest the pick."", ""That being said, it's not as if the position is misaligned with Buffett's usual stock-selection regimen, nor is it out of place within the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The company's business is actually quite easy to understand, for example -- Apple makes smartphones, and supports their sales by providing a robust ecosystem of apps that extract every ounce of functionality from the device."", ""There's another detail about Apple, however, that that arguably even better qualifies it as a Buffett pick. That is, it's a strong business with clear competitive advantages. Underscoring this claim are numbers from market research outfit Bionic, which reports 92.6% of iPhone users intend to buy another one in the future while only 74.6% of current Android smartphone users say they'll buy another Android phone when the time comes. Meanwhile, mobile app consultant Asymco's Horace Dediu says iPhone users spend on the order of 7 times more on apps and digital content than Android users do. That's a clear, significant edge."", ""Last but not last, add Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to consider if you've got a few extra thousand bucks to work with at this time. Berkshire Hathaway's holding a little over 1 billion shares of the megabank right now, making it the fund's second-biggest holding."", ""Boring? A little. But that's kind of the point. Owning stocks as a form of entertainment can often work against you. Like Buffett, you want to hold stocks that dish out superior long-term rewards without a bunch of drama in the short run. BofA does exactly that."", ""OK, there's been one exception to this reliable progress. That's the stock's sizable pullback in 2008 following the subprime mortgage meltdown."", ""Like so many other banking stocks around that time, this one was riding high on a movement that would eventually -- and abruptly -- be undermined. In fact, Bank of America shares have yet to reclaim their 2006 high. That's mostly because abnormally low interest rates in the meantime have crimped lending's profit margin rates."", ""That collapse and the subsequent several years' worth of low interest rates are the exception to the norm, however. Things are easing back to normal now. And, having remembered the harsh lessons taught by 2008's mortgage market collapse, it's unlikely BofA is going to put itself in a similar situation again in the near future."", ""The real appeal to investors here, however, is the dividend. Bank of America shares' current dividend yield stands at a healthy 2.9%, based on a quarterly payment that's grown from $0.12 per share in 2017 (when the banking industry finally and fully shook off the impact of 2008's nightmare) to $0.24 per share now. That's a compound annual growth rate of more 9%, far outpacing inflation's growth during that stretch.

In 2023, we achieved our near-term goals while also positioning our business for the long term. Our all-weather strategy delivered 8% comparable earnings per share growth despite greater-than-expected 7% currency headwinds. Today, we are leveraging our scale globally and winning locally, which gives us confidence that we can deliver on our 2024 guidance. This morning, I'll talk about the global consumer landscape, then I'll highlight how our strategy and enhanced capabilities are making us a more agile and effective organization. And finally, John will discuss our financial results and our 2024 guidance. During the quarter, we benefited from strong performance across many of our markets, however, some were impacted by elevated inflation and others by geopolitical tensions and conflict. We delivered 12% organic revenue growth, which included 2 points of volume growth continuing a positive volume trend for the year. Throughout, we continue to invest in our business to provide the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and attract more drinkers. We drove industry growth and delivered value share gains in the quarter and for the full year. We achieved these results by effectively navigating a number of headwinds and capitalizing on tailwinds across our markets. During the quarter, we saw strong consumer demand across Australia, India, Latin America, Japan and South Korea. In North America, consumer spending in aggregate is holding up well. And in Europe, consumers remain cost conscious. In Africa and China, the macro environment remains uncertain. And in the Middle East, tensions have resulted in some shifts in consumer behavior that have had an impact on our business. Another important factor to highlight is the inflationary pressures, which are moderating or stabilizing across most of our markets. To keep consumers in our franchise, we are leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to tailor our offerings and price pack architecture to meet consumers' evolving needs. In North America and Europe, while inflation is moderating, the cumulative impact of inflation is pressuring certain consumer segments who are seeking value. Throughout 2023, we increased our affordability offerings and won volume and value share in both regions. In Latin America, despite double-digit inflation during the fourth quarter, we grew volume 4% and increased household penetration and basket and incidence. There are a few pockets of the world that are experiencing hyperinflation. John will later speak to how this dynamic is impacting our business. However, I did want to mention that our local franchise operating model allows us to navigate through hyperinflationary environments and then gain an advantage over the long term. Across our business, we continue to prioritize agility and focus on improving every aspect of how we operate. An important part of this is our marketing transformation. To recruit the next generation of drinkers, our marketing has shifted from a TV-centric model to a digital-first organization that balances local intimacy, scale and flexibility. Our digital mix has gone from less than 30% in 2019 to approximately 60% of our total media spend. In 2023, we stood up Studio X, the digital ecosystem that brings this all together. We created physical hubs in each of our operating units, to integrate disciplines, standardize data and technology and step change our capabilities. Creative, media, social and production capabilities are now operating at scale, connected by our global network structure. In our previous model, it took several months to create a TV ad. Now we're producing thousands of pieces of digital content that are contextually relevant and measuring these results in real time. Studio X is driving tangible results. For example, Coke Studio, which originated in Pakistan and taps into consumers' passion for music has been scaled to our top 40 markets. The campaign uses packaging as digital portals to access real magic experiences, which have generated more than 1.2 billion YouTube views and 100 million music streams this year, resulting in strong recruitment of Gen Z drinkers. We're engaging differently with consumers and is delivering results. In 2023, according to Kantar, Coca-Cola brand value increased $8 billion. Coke is now the tenth most valuable brand in the world, up 7 spots from the prior year. In the U.S., Sprite was named by Morning Consult as the #1 beverage brand for Gen Z drinkers. We were also named 1 of the top 10 innovative companies in augmented and virtual reality by Fast Company. Our innovation agenda is increasing our competitive advantage across our products, packaging and equipment. Taste is the selling point. Simply put, people want drinks that taste great. To drive superiority across our total beverage portfolio, we're continuing to build capabilities to tap into unique insights in taste and aroma science. We're applying digital tools, ingredient processing technology and AI to create bolder and more successful innovations.Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is an ongoing example of how superior taste drives demand, with volume that grew 5% in 2023, leading to continued volume and value share gains. We're applying learnings from this multiyear success and driving taste superiority elsewhere in our sparkling portfolio. In 2023, we launched Sprite and Fanta reformulations in 25 markets, delivering mid-single-digit volume growth in those markets and driving overall sparkling flavors value share gains. Outside of our sparkling portfolio, we're dialing up flavor profiles, adding functional benefits and expanding into new categories. In Japan, we've relaunched Georgia Coffee, which generated broader customer interest and led to value share gains. In the U.S., fairlife's core power and nutrition plan offer high protein dairy without compromising taste. In 2023, fairlife grew volume 1%. Its ninth consecutive year of double-digit volume growth. We're also seeing continued promising results from Fuze Tea across Europe, Jack & Coke in the Philippines, Flashlyte in Mexico, among many others. In 2023, innovation contributed to approximately 30% of gross profit growth and our success rates have nearly tripled compared to 2019 levels. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities continue to be distinct advantages as demonstrated by our ability to deliver volume and transaction growth despite ongoing inflationary pressures. We're working with our bottling partners to capture every opportunity available to create significant value for consumers and customers. By offering a total beverage portfolio in the right packages and at the right price points, we're driving category expansion and becoming more relevant to more consumers and customers. In North America, we're evolving packaging options across more distribution points to drive affordability and premiumization. On the affordability side, our 1.25-liter PET bottles are now available in 80% of supermarkets, and our 16-ounce can distribution increased by 14 points in convenience stores during 2023. We're also focused on premiumization through the expansion of our mini-can offerings. During the quarter, we launched 15-pack mini cans in grocery and club channels. In Europe, we're leveraging the same playbook but adapting it to local needs. In Spain, our 1.25-liter PET package is offered at a compelling price point, and it drove 16% volume growth and increased household penetration in 2023. In Italy, Great Britain and Ireland, we drove premium single-serve mini cans as smaller package offerings to generate positive mix and incremental retail sales. Our franchise system uniquely combines the benefits of scale and knowledge sharing with the know-how needed to execute for customers and win locally in many different operating environments. For example, approximately 70% of purchasers' decisions are influenced at point of sale. Our systems stepped up in-store displays during the quarter, which drove incremental retail sales and cross-selling opportunities. Putting it all together, we've created $15 billion in incremental retail sales for our customers in 2023, more than any other beverage company. This was our sixth year in a row as the leader in value creation. While we're pleased with our progress, we recognize there's still much work to be done to capture the vast opportunities available, and our system is galvanized to move further and faster. Before I hand over to John, I want to acknowledge that none of this could happen without the unwavering dedication of our employees. And so as we turn to 2024, we expect the year will bring new challenges and opportunities, and we remain ready to respond through continuing to improve execution of our strategy across our total beverage portfolio. I look forward to sharing more next Tuesday at CAGNY, and I encourage everyone to listen in. With that, I'll turn the call over to John."", 'John Murphy', ""Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter and throughout 2023, we delivered strong results. During the quarter, we grew organic revenues 12%, which was in line with our full year organic revenue growth. Unit case growth was 2% and was positive in each quarter of 2023. Concentrate sales grew 1 point ahead of unit cases, driven primarily by 1 additional day in the quarter. Our price mix growth of 9% in the quarter was driven by 3 factors: one, 2023 pricing actions across most of our markets; two, hyperinflationary pricing that I'll speak to in just a moment; and three, some mix, which is mostly timing related. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 140 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth, partially offset by currency headwinds and an increase in marketing investments.The positive volume and top line growth that we're realizing today demonstrates the effectiveness of our marketing spend. Below the line, comparable other income declined primarily due to the operating environment in Argentina. Putting it all together, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.49 was up 10% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 13% currency headwinds. Before moving on, I want to discuss the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets on our fourth quarter results. During the quarter, inflation intensified and exceeded 60% across these markets. In aggregate, while they represent less than 5% of our total volume, this degree of inflation creates a cosmetic distortion to our underlying results. In the fourth quarter, these markets contributed more than 3 points of our price/mix and most of our currency headwinds, including an outsized impact to comparable other income from balance sheet remeasurements in Argentina. They did not, however, have a material impact on our earnings per share results. In hyperinflationary markets, it's either impractical or impossible to hedge our currency exposure. And to manage it, we use our full suite of revenue growth management tools, including pricing actions to keep pace with local market inflation. We have been operating a long time in these markets, and we expect to be in them for a long time to come. We work hand in hand with our local bottling partners, and our focus will be to continue to nurture the strong relationships we have with our consumers and customers and to ultimately prevail longer term. So while we will continue to experience volatility of this nature in a few markets. It's important to keep in mind they are operated locally, they are typically self-funding, and they have not impeded our overall ability to grow earnings per share. As we move forward, we are confident our business model and the many levers within it will allow us to deliver on our overall objectives. In 2023, free cash flow was $9.7 billion, which increased from the prior year. 2023 free cash flow included a transition tax payment of approximately $720 million which was approximately $340 million higher than the prior year and included approximately $230 million in M&A-related payments. Our underlying free cash flow growth was largely attributable to strong operational performance and working capital benefits. If you exclude the full impact of the transition tax and M&A-related payments, our adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio would be within our target range of 90% to 95%. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.7x EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. During the fourth quarter, in addition to offsetting dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees, we repurchased additional shares in anticipation of expected proceeds from bottler refranchising. As James mentioned, we anticipate 2024 will bring new challenges and opportunities. However, through our all-weather strategy, we've proven we can deliver in many different operating environments. Our 2024 guidance builds on the underlying momentum of our business. We expect organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10%. We anticipate hyperinflationary pricing will continue to play a role in 2024, but will moderate throughout the year. We continue to make significant progress towards refranchising company-owned bottling operations. Bottle refranchising is expected to be a 4- to 5-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 2-point headwind to comparable earnings per share, but will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 2- to 3-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 4- to 5-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Notably, much of our anticipated 2024 currency headwinds are attributed to hyperinflationary markets with a meaningful impact in the first quarter. Our underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be 19.2%. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.69 in 2023. We expect to generate approximately $9.2 billion of free cash flow in 2024 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $2.2 billion in capital investments. The $11.4 billion of cash from operations includes 2 items to highlight: transition tax payments of approximately $960 million, an increase of approximately $240 million versus 2023; payments associated with various M&A transactions of approximately $560 million, an increase of approximately $330 million versus 2023. Driven by our underlying cash flow generation and current balance sheet strength, we have ample flexibility to both reinvest in our business to drive growth and return capital to our shareowners. A significant portion of our expected capital investment increase is to build capacity for fairlife and for our India business, both of which experienced robust growth in 2023. Related to capital return, we have an unwavering priority to grow our dividend as we've done with 61 consecutive years of dividend increases. With respect to share repurchases, we'll be flexible in our approach. Typically, we've repurchased shares to offset any dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees in the given year. Our capital allocation policy prioritizes agility, and we're committed to taking the right actions needed to drive the long-term health of our business and create value for our stakeholders. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2024. The first quarter of 2024 will be impacted by the timing of concentrate shipments in the fourth quarter of 2023 in some markets and cycling our strongest volume growth quarter from the prior year. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East had approximately 1 point of impact on volume growth during the fourth quarter of 2023. It's unclear how long this impact will last. In November 2023, the U.S. Tax Court rendered its supplemental opinion related to our ongoing dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. We intend to move forward on appeal and vigorously defend our position. We have ample balance sheet flexibility to fund any payment related to the appeal. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be 1 less day in the first quarter and 2 additional days in the fourth quarter. So in summary, we're pleased with what we accomplished in 2023. We're building on our capabilities to continue the underlying momentum across our markets. We're progressing on our refranchising agenda, and we're reinvesting in our system to drive long-term growth. We have great confidence we can deliver on our 2024 guidance and long-term commitments. And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.', 'Lauren Rae Lieberman', ""I know John just went through a lot of details on the guide, but I do just want to step back and maybe go to a higher level conversation on this. Because for '23, you ended up with high single-digit earnings growth even with that 7-point currency headwind. And the initial guide for '24 for mid-single-digit earnings growth feels like a reasonable starting point. But can you just contextualize a bit how you're thinking about the impact of hyperinflation, like John mentioned the Middle East tensions, the consumer backdrop, et cetera, so how are you able to kind of come through with that U.S. dollar-based earnings growth outlook for the year?"", 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Yes, a couple of things. Firstly, the mid-single-digit growth in '24 is after the impact of the refranchising that we've called out. So in other words, pre-structural change, that's really 6% to 7%. Second, what I think '24 represents is ultimately a continuation of the underlying strength and momentum in the business that's been created. If you look at '23 or you look all the way back to 2019, take 5 years, if you like. What is captured within that is the kernel of the core business running at the top end of the growth algorithm. Yes, there's been inflation and distractions and up and downs. But in the end, running through that is a continuous amount of volume growth as we focus on our consumer franchise and keeping people in and growing the weekly plus consumers in our franchise. Managing the cycle of inflation that is now distinct depending on where you are in the world, but managing that cycle of inflation, such that we now have in the majority of the countries, 90-plus percent of the countries, normalized levels of kind of pricing more or less coming out of 2023. And so what you see in this guidance is really the core business in the 90-plus percent of the countries, really taking that combination of headwinds and tailwinds that we've experienced, there will be a different set in '24, there are bound to be some new surprises. But we will manage through them with our all-weather strategy and deliver volume growth. Growth in the consumer base with weekly plus. We'll earn our right to take an appropriate level of pricing and deliver at the top end of the growth algorithm. And then there's the overlay of the inflationary markets and the selling of the bottler -- the bottling investment groups that we've done. And that hyperinflation is, as John said, a few points on the top and obviously, there's some on the bottom and largely offset by the devaluation. So those 2 things go together. But captured within that is a strong growing top and bottom in line with the growth algorithm."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.', 'Dara Warren Mohsenian', ""So maybe just a quick follow-up there. As you think about that 6% to 7% organic sales growth guidance for '24, can you just give us a bit more detail on volume versus pricing on the underlying business, maybe ex the hyperinflationary markets, just as we think about that balance between volume and pricing? And then, James, just more importantly, longer term, perhaps you can just take a step back and review your confidence in delivering that long-term top line algorithm and the higher end of that algorithm just as you look out over the next few years. Taking a look back at the last few years, there's obviously been a lot of volatility. Hard for us to judge from an external perspective, given all the volatility with COVID. But how do you think about sort of the success of the strategic initiatives you put in place the last few years? And what level of confidence that gives you in the long term looking out a few years?"", 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Sure. Look, I'll try and adjust the various angles there. Let me unpack a little bit '23 and -- the end of '23 as a way of coming into '24. And in '23, we had 2% volume growth. And that was true in the fourth quarter, and it was true through the year. And actually, if you take a 5-year CAGR, we've been running at 2% volume growth for the last 5 years. So to start with the volume, there's been strong underlying volume growth in the last quarter, in the last year, in the last 5 years. So that's there. And we -- that's true because we focused on building momentum in the system, around building the consumer franchise. When you look at how that's come along with pricing, obviously, there's the pandemic, the ups and downs and inflation. But let's just break apart 2023 and how that then flows into '24. If you look at the fourth quarter '23, it says 9%. Yes, it's -- as John pointed out, there's a couple of points there that's related to intra-year, quarter-to-quarter deduction timing. So take off the 2 and you get a 7. Of the remaining 7, half of it is normal pricing in the 95% of the business that's not hyperinflationary. And the other 3.5% is in the hyperinflationary countries because the inflation is so high. So really, what have you got in the fourth quarter? You've got 2% volume, you got 3.5%, a bit more than 3.5% price/mix, and that's the core. There, you've got something that's running bang in the center of the long-term growth algorithm of 5% to 6% on the top line. It was true in the fourth quarter. It's true as the kernel in the whole 2023. Actually, it's really true across the whole of the last 5 years, once you take out some of these inflationary distortions and the selling of the bottling company. So there, it is running the last quarter, the last year, the last 5 years. Think about '24. We're going to go as we've always said, for a balance of volume and price. In that 95% of the business, we're going to see volume growth and we're going to see normalized pricing growth. Our aim is for the net of the 2 to be in that top end of the long-term growth algorithm for revenue growth. Yes, there's going to be an overlay of hyperinflation, that's probably more like a couple of points as we think about 2024 on the top line, and that's why you get what we've called out in terms of the top line growth. So hopefully, that unpacks a bit of how price mix has got this hyperinflation [distortion] in it. Actually, it's also got the selling and the bottlers if you don't do it on comparable. But really embedded in that 6% to 7% is keep hitting the long-term growth revenue for kind of the sixth year. And we feel the momentum we've built with our bottling partners, investing in the marketing, the innovation, the in-store execution, the execution in the marketplace with the RGM strategies across the global portfolio of geographies gives us strong confidence we will continue with our momentum."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.', 'Bonnie Lee Herzog', 'All right. I actually had a question on gross margins. I was hoping for a little bit more color on the drivers of your expansion in Q4, which came in better than expected. And then could you highlight maybe the key puts and takes on margins this year? Curious how much do you expect COGS inflation maybe to moderate or will higher sugar costs continue to be a big headwind?', 'John Murphy', ""Thanks, Bonnie. Let me start if I just pick up from where James left off and step out of both the quarter and the year. If you look over the last 4 years, our -- we've been able to sustain a pretty resilient gross margin line. And as we go into 2024, expect to be able to continue to do so. There's some expansion embedded in the long-term growth model, and we're confident that we can continue to drive that. With respect to 2023, the key ingredients, so to speak, were the impact of the various pricing actions we've had around the world, somewhat offset by higher and normal inflation with some of our commodity items and indeed some are non-commodity costs. But overall, for 2023, that's the key story. In 2024, I think you need to take into account the mechanical impact of the refranchising of those markets that we talked about in the release that will layer in throughout 2024. Keep in mind to the impact of foreign currency headwinds. I think against that then, we will continue to drive the levers that we have. I've talked about this in the past, but maybe worth just highlighting, we start really with that suite of revenue growth management tools and the many actions that we can take with that. We have a very resilient supply chain, tremendous partners across the supply chain. We source mostly locally and we continue to drive through our scale, a lot of productivity in almost each line item of what comprises the supply chain. So going into 2024, I think it's worth just reiterating, we expect to see margin expansion. Some of it driven by that mechanical effect of the bottler refranchising and with some more normalized cost inflation relative to the last couple of years plus continuing to deploy those levers I talked about, we see the opportunity to continue to drive per our long-term growth model expansion."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.', 'Bryan Douglass Spillane', ""I'd like to just drill in a little bit more on North America. And James, I think on the last earnings call, you talked a little bit about channel shift, right, like on-premise or foodservice maybe growing faster than some of the take-home channels. There were some commentary, I think, also about -- or observations I should say, about maybe low-income consumers. So maybe just kind of state of things there. And John, just if you can also clarify, I think in the press release, there was mention in the description around price/mix, some sort of adjustment. So I wasn't sure if that's an accrual related to promotions or just if you could just give us a little bit more color on that as well. And also sounds like concentrate shipments might have lagged in the quarter, so do we make that up in the first quarter? I know there's a lot there, but if you guys can just fill in, that would be helpful."", 'John Murphy', ""Yes. Let me take the end and then I'll pass it over to James for the beginning. The mix that you refer to is timing related. And it's not unusual in the fourth quarter to have timing-related items in the deductions area, particularly. That will flow back through into next year."", 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Yes. Consumer, to -- let me go with 2 things here. One, clearly, the consumer landscape in North America, one has to not think of it in aggregate because actually, in aggregate, the U.S. consumer spending power has held up pretty strongly compared to some other developed markets. What has been important is to understand there's a section of the population that has come under pressure from disposable income, the real spending power squeeze from the inflationary effect. And there, we are very much focused on affordability, and you could perhaps argue that some of them went out less -- there was more at-home purchases, some of the certain channels. And there, we really focused with affordability both from pack size -- individual pack size and with multipack. On the other hand, there's a segment of consumers that still have plenty of money, plenty of purchasing power, and we've seen strong growth for some of the higher price point, premium segments like fairlife, Core Power, Simply, some of those ones. So there's clearly multiple things going on in the landscape in terms of categories and price points, and we've been working to address both ends of those. And as it relates to channels, I think we've seen the kind of renormalization. There has been a historic slight shift in volume consumption from at-home to away over time. Clearly, through COVID, there was a big down in the away-from-home and then a rebound in '21, the away-from-home channels. In '22, they out but they continue to outpace at-home. In '23, they were slightly ahead of at-home. If you look at the various away-from-home channels, they were slightly ahead of at-home. I would say that that's landing more in what it was previous to COVID, kind of the more normal situation. So that was kind of what I would say, strong need to focus on the different consumer segments and the sort of renormalization of some of the channel dynamics."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.', 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', ""Two questions, if I could. I know I'm supposed to have one, but one is quick. Just on the -- if you could clarify maybe for John, you called out the 2% to 3% currency headwinds for next year on the revenue but a 4% to 5% headwind on EPS. Just if you could, how much of that incremental bottom line headwind is going to show up in operating profit versus below the line given monetary asset revaluation, et cetera? And then I guess the broader question is just thinking about all the refranchising activity and the system progress that you made in '23. We talked about the financial impacts of that in '24, but I guess I'd love your perspective, James, on the importance of the steps you made in '23 in terms of just betterment of the system overall and priorities going forward from a system evolution perspective."", 'James Robert B. Quincey', 'Okay. Should I start at this time and then you go second, John?', 'John Murphy', 'Sure.', 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Sure. Look, we have been focused on our refranchising effort. And as -- I like John's phrase, our ambition is to be the world's smallest bottler. It still remains absolutely true, but we're going to do it at the pace, so to make sure we do the refranchise in the right way with the right partners. I think we can categorically say we're very pleased with the refranchise process that we have undertaken over the last number of years. Almost without exception, every time we put one of the bottling companies into the hands of the right partner with a joint vision and investment plan to take the business forward, we have stepped up performance, whether it be a straight refranchising or a combination creating new bottlers or evolved bottlers, we have upped the level of performance. And I think that is a sign of the commitment of the company to invest in what it does best, which is the branding, the marketing, the innovation, working with our bottlers to get the revenue growth management and their unwavering commitment to drive execution and build capabilities and capacities in the marketplace. And that has helped power the overall performance I talked about in the answer to the previous questions. So as -- I think we're in the penultimate chapter of the refranchising. There's only really a couple of pieces left, at the right time with the right partners, we would like to finish the play. But really, we have our eye on the prize on creating a much stronger system together with our bottling partners to continue the top of the algorithm momentum very far into the future."", 'John Murphy', ""Great. And on currency, Steve, let me just make a couple of comments in case there are other questions out there on currency overall. First of all, I think it's important to highlight the '24 guidance that we've given, it would be close to flat if we were to exclude those few hyperinflationary markets. And it just reinforces the point that we're making on that sort of distortion that those few markets have. And then secondly, with regard to your specific question, I do not have that breakdown. Today, there's just too many. There's just too many puts and takes, particularly in that -- below the operating income line as we go through the year. You've got to do a monthly remeasurement on the balance sheet items and that's just a calculation that I don't have -- I don't have the ability to predict with great detail. So just keep in mind that the overall impact, I think, is the one to focus on. In normal years, the multiplier is 1.5 to 2x. We would continue to assume that will be the case going forward. But these hyperinflationary markets have a tendency to create that distortion that we've highlighted. And we'll continue to provide guidance as we go through the year to make sure that everybody stays abreast of the latest developments."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.', 'Robert Edward Ottenstein', ""So, James, I think you made a very strong case that really over the last 5 years, if you ex out the noise, you've delivered at roughly kind of 5% top line growth, which puts you clearly in the top rankings of your other staples companies, and that's great. In terms of both '24 and looking forward, assuming a continuation of that, what can you do to both derisk that in terms of the bottom line and enhance it in terms of the bottom line, given the various macro variables?And then given that you've now delevered to 1.7, you've shown interest in buying back stock should we think of share buybacks as perhaps a greater part of the overall algorithm and value creation for shareholders going forward?"", 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Okay. So I mean, I think the derisking, I think what I would say is, look, we faced an extraordinary number of headwinds in the last 5 years and still delivered at the top end of the algorithm. Things will happen in the coming years, but there'll be tailwinds. And I think really the argument about the all-weather is, I cannot tell you what the future holds. But if you look at what we've managed to work through and deliver at the top end on the revenue, and the momentum and the capabilities that we've built in the system, and actually, if you look at the share and look at our long-term performance of also gaining share within the industry, I think you can see ahead of steam builds up on momentum. And at the scale that we operate, it's a very compelling way to drive it forward. And as that feeds down into the bottom line. Obviously, the mid-single-digit U.S. dollar EPS call for 2024 includes the disposal of 2 points of EPS from the bottling system. So kind of on an ongoing basis, that's already 6% to 7%. I think we can continue to drive some leverage from the top line to the bottom line in dollars, and that becomes a compelling compound over time.And as it relates to cash, I think that you will see we've put in a kind of a new non-GAAP metric somewhere in the ecosystem of the website, which just calls out what John was talking about, about the number of discrete items that are coming up over the next couple of years as it relates to transition tax, actually curiously, tax on the M&A transactions. If you sell a bottler, the money you get disappears into one account but the tax you pay goes into the free cash flow, curiously enough. So there's a whole set of discrete items that make the free cash flow look odd for the next few years. But if you strip that out, you see that the earnings are flowing into free cash flow. The cash conversion on that adjusted basis remains very high and is likely to do so. So on a -- in a normal world, clearly, as John said, we will continue to increase our dividend, and we would have substantive additional cash to continue to invest in the business and consider potential share repurchases. The wrinkle in the cream, if you like, is our considerations of the IRS tax case and the impending appeal. And so as we go forward for the next few years, we like our strong balance sheet. We are mindful of the likelihood of launching the appeal in the second half. We have incoming nonoperating cash flows, which as John talked about, we used to buy some shares in the fourth quarter. We're going to balance all these things particularly in the next couple of years, we'll keep everyone updated. But I think the long-term perspective is that the cash generation will continue to be very strong. John, yes, go on."", 'John Murphy', ""Just one additional point. In addition to that unwavering commitment we have to the dividend that we've talked about in the script, one of the lessons I think over the last couple of years is to be prepared to be more dynamic relative to your kind of normal view of the individual components. So as you know, our debt goal is to be 2x to 2.5x, and we're at 1.7. We think that's right for what we need going into 2024, 2025. We've taken up our CapEx for 2024 because it's the right thing to do to continue to build the growth foundations that we need in those parts of the business that need capacity. Just 2 examples. And so I think we will continue to demonstrate that as we go forward. The share repurchases in the back half of the year, again, was not something that we had necessarily considered at the start of the year, but we -- first, there was an opportunity with the bottler proceeds coming in to do so. And we continue to take that approach as we enter this coming year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo.', 'Christopher Michael Carey', ""I wanted to see if you could maybe frame the global away-from-home channel? I know you touched on it a little bit in response to Bryan's question, but we've heard about, obviously, there's a lot of pricing power in that channel. There's been a lot of pricing. You're talking about a normalization from elevated levels back to a more normal channel distribution between at-home and away-from-home. But can you maybe just give us a bit more granular perspective on what you're seeing by region and whether some of the strengths that I think was occurring in Q4 has continued into this year."", 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Yes. Sure, Chris. I'll give it a go. Look, I think the headline is the commentary about North America to some extent, applies -- to some extent, applies everywhere else in the sense that clearly in COVID, there was the closedowns, the reopening, big swings between away-from-home and at-home. But in '22, it kind of renormalized. And I think overall, in '23, you see that again. You saw that in the U.S. where the away-from-home channels in aggregate were slightly ahead of the at-home channels. You see that also in Europe, or in the EMEA segment, you see the at-home slightly, but it's only marginal. And when you break it down, I mean there's going to be the kind of continuing structural growth of away-from-home, but it's only a small fraction. If that's a sort of -- if that's the sort of leading to a question about pricing and is there some ongoing likelihood of a big upside from kind of channel mix, the short answer is no. If I were to take a proxy of immediate consumption packages and future comps and consumption packages, because channel mix becomes very different as you get to different parts of the world, particularly the emerging markets, then they became much more -- the kind of the immediate consumption came much more into balance versus the future consumption in '23 relative to '22. And that's not too surprising as we start to also think about affordability having been a strategy in 2023. So that's a roundabout way of saying we're not expecting big mix effects from channel in '24."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.', 'Andrea Faria Teixeira', ""James, can you comment a little bit about the U.S.? I understand, obviously, U.S. is not -- in terms of the volumes, it's about 20%. But within your outlook for 2024, you quoted in the fourth quarter that water sports coffee were more negative or decelerating. And how about -- what is -- of that is like mostly self-inflicted, vis-a-vis, what you're actually facing in terms of market share? And how much you expect that to be lingering into the first half of '24?And just a clarification to your comment now in terms of like the shift into on-premise and back to your comments on price mix. Out of the 9% that you got, if my math is correct, you've got about 2% or 3% benefit from mix in 2023. Should we expect that to decelerate? Or with your efforts to do more mini cans and take that more broadly, is that still going to be the projected contribution for 2024?"", 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Sure. Okay. The comments on the 2% in the fourth quarter, that was related not to channel mix, but to the rate that -- the way that deductions happen. So this is not -- this is often just an accounting treatment between the quarters within the year. So it's not mix as you would think about it in terms of package mix or channel mix or category mix. This is related to kind of the big difference between gross and net revenue. And so it's a distraction in the short term. So I would move past that one. And if you like, to me, ignore that bit, focus instead on the underlying impact in 2023 of the nonhyperinflationary pricing, which was the kind of 3.5%, which is very -- which ran through 2023 and is inherent in what we're saying, roughly speaking, for 2024. So we're expecting rate and mix whether it's channel category, geography, package, the sort of things we were saying, which in '23 is what we're expecting in '24. And again, those are all largely normalized in '23. So by inference, they're all largely normalized in '24 as well. So you kind of see a stability across channels, packages, et cetera, et cetera. As it relates more specifically to the U.S., yes, we did some deprioritization of some of the bulk water categories. And some of the advanced hydration was the normalization or restabilization of the sports drinks category. I mean I don't think there's an obvious or useful split between self-inflicted or proactive decisions versus things that were competitive, that's hard to tease apart.Clearly, from a performance point of view, when we think about it in the U.S., yes, there was a fractional softening of the volume through the year, which I think goes back to the comment I made about the different consumer segments. But if you step back and think about what was the overall impact of our marketing, innovation, RGM and execution with the bottlers, the answer is we won volume share in 2023, and we won value share in 2023. So yes, there's work to be done in the water category and advanced hydration and to a much lesser extent, in tea. But the overall picture is strong growth in sparkling, particularly Coke and Sprite, good on smart water, good on vitamin water, good on Topo Chico, very good on fairlife, good overall win on both dimensions. And that's the platform we'll be looking to drive in 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist.', 'William Bates Chappell', ""Just a question on kind of the Chinese -- China consumer and both kind of how it's progressed or how he or she has progressed over the past few months versus your expectations or just in general and kind of what you see kind of spending power and just getting back to normal consumption as we move into '24."", 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Sure. Let me put it -- '23 started very strongly in China. We had invested very heavily behind Chinese New Year. And we had -- actually, we had a very strong first quarter last year in China. And then -- which is kind of still the back end of the reopening. And while we grew volumes for the rest and for the total of the year '23 and revenues, it did soften for the last 3 quarters of the year in China. And I think what we're going to see is kind of a reverse of that in '24. We've invested strongly again in Chinese New Year this year. We won't know the results for another few weeks, net-net. But we're kind of expecting it to be a little slower in the first quarter, especially given what we're cycling from last year, and then for the year to improve. But not too hot and not too cold, if I can use that analogy. So yes, there's a little weakness in the economic system, but we expect things to get -- we get -- tend directionally to get better through the year. And we're going to keep investing behind not just key moments in the year like Chinese New Year, but restoring more momentum to sparkling and really focusing on RGM and execution opportunities."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies.', 'Kaumil S. Gajrawala', ""When we met in December, we talked a little bit about 2023, there was a bunch of testing and learning on innovation and '24 will be about scaling some of them. Both of you mentioned fairlife, Core Power, it's a big brand now. Can you maybe just talk about the scaling of that capacity expansion, and then maybe what other brands we should be considering in that same context?"", 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Yes, sure. I mean, firstly, we're going to continue to experiment and find lots of new things, hopefully in 2024. But it's certainly true, as you say, that fairlife has been on a roll, and we have been driving that. I think it's had near double-digit volume growth for as many years I can remember plus faster double digits in revenue. Clearly, as we've scaled that, we needed to put down more capacity. We have recently announced and begun the process of building a mega plant up in upstate New York. And so capacity is tight in the fairlife business and Core Power is also firing on all cylinders. We'll certainly talk about some of these at CAGNY when we'll kind of lay out some of the back story, things like fairlife, and particularly Core Power and how these brands and products have done a great job in driving from experimentation to scaling to challenging and for example, in the case of Core Power, to leading."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.', 'Peter K. Grom', ""So James, I was hoping to pick up on your commentary in response to Bryan and Andrea's question on the U.S. Maybe first, did performance in the quarter play out as you expected? You mentioned softening in the market in your response to Andrea, but was that in line with how you thought growth would evolve? Or was it a bit weaker than you would have anticipated? And then looking ahead to '24, I appreciate the commentary on expecting balanced growth at the total company level. But do you expect that balance to occur in North America as well?"", 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Yes. Look, I mean, I think it was at a macro level foreseeable that the market would get tighter through the course of 2023 as inflation ran ahead of wage growth. And so therefore, yes, it wasn't surprising, that tightness, particularly for certain consumer segments. I think all things in due proportion. I mean the growth in North America in the fourth quarter was basically the same as the growth in the full year, there's only very fractional differences. So I think these are not big changes in trends. But yes, I think there was a little softening through 2023. And I think we'll see that kind of a bit in reverse as '24 starts off, as consumers -- and you can see it in the confidence indicators, the consumers, they're starting to feel like the money coming in is starting to contain and get ahead of the inflation. So I think we'll see that improve through the year. Again, all in due proportion. There are not going to be big shifts in the volume growth rate in the U.S. business. In aggregate, we would expect to get more from price relative to volume for the U.S. business. So the balance that I talk about between price and volume applies on a global basis. Clearly, that's then made up of geographic portfolio mix. So places like the U.S. We'd expect to see stable or slightly increasing volume with decent pricing, all the way over to places like India where clearly, we're getting much more volume than price and having to invest significantly in capacity. And those 2 -- take those 2 examples, but that's true of the global portfolio. Blend it all together, and that's where the balance comes from."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn Atlantic.', 'Charlie Higgs', ""I've got a question on sparkling, please, where I mean, 2% volume growth in the quarter and the year, very strong. And I think in the '20 quarters since 2019, it's actually averaged 3% in those 20 quarters, so definitely not ex growth. And I was just wondering what your perspective is on the category going forward, maybe with the consumer weakening? And if you can just touch on the launch of Coca-Cola Spiced? So I don't think we've talked about that yet. I mean what gives you the confidence of launching this just as a permanent launch rather than a limited edition Coke Creations launch? Who is the target consumer? Is it going out of Gen Zs? Is it there to help with Coke-with-meals strategy? Just any color on that would be useful, please."", 'James Robert B. Quincey', ""Yes. I mean Coke Spiced, a bit like Coke Creations, not exactly, but is really aimed at increasing connectivity with Gen Z and the broader water consumers, driving engagement, driving reconsideration. It's part of a whole overall strategy that, as you say, we've been deploying for a good number of years that has really worked to reengage consumers with the Coke trademark, whether it's Coke Original or Coke Zero Sugar or even Diet Coke. Does that make sense? The overall strategy of an operated approach to the marketing, the innovation, whether it's Coke Spiced or some of the Creations through the RGM and the execution has allowed us to drive Coke growth across the global business. And actually, by also increasing the focus on Fanta and Sprite, even organizationally splitting them out into 2 sub teams within the organization has allowed us to bring more clarity and more focus onto Fanta and Sprite and to drive growth there, too, which has worked in Q4 in 2023, and as you say, over the last 5 years. I know that sometimes people -- well, I would say that people think about the sparkling category just through the optic of the U.S. over the last 20 years. And I would invite you to look at the optics -- or everyone to look at the optics of the sparkling category globally over time. And actually, there, you see that the category remains robust at a global scale, both in terms of volume and revenue growth. And of course, we are not just the leaders but we're the share winners. So we see, if we do the right things for our brands, we will be able to drive the category forward and benefit disproportionately from that growth."", 'Operator', 'Our last question today will come from Carlos Laboy from HSBC.', 'Carlos Alberto Laboy', ""Can you comment for us on the state of global independent bottlers CapEx or digital capabilities?

Carlos, I think it's fair to say that the overall investment levels that you referred to in Lat Am are pretty consistent across the world. Like one of the underlying tailwinds, I believe, we have is the degree to which our system is sharing in us the opportunities ahead and willing to increasingly invest ahead of the curve. So I think that's happening across the global system. One of the subsets of that, of course, is the degree to which digital in its many forms is playing a pivotal role to sustaining and indeed building advantage wherever we operate. We have CAGNY next week. And I think you'll hear more of that threaded through the conversation we'll tee up there. But safe to say, I think CapEx levels are at the highest as a percentage of system revenue that I can remember.

Joining me on the call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we will update you on the Company's fourth quarter and full year performance and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2024. I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission."", ""This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers.

Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations, with net sales for the quarter of approximately $2.6 billion, down 1.4% as reported or 4.1% on a constant and legacy basis. Lower demand in residential remodeling and new construction continued to impact our results. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.96, with benefits from cost containment, productivity and lower input costs. Pricing and product mix declined offset by lower raw material and energy costs during the quarter. Foreign exchange had an impact of approximately $22 million on operating income, or $0.27 on EPS. Turning to our full year results. Mohawk's net sales were approximately $11.1 billion, down approximately 5% as reported or 7.7% on a constant basis with adjusted EPS of $9.19."", ""Last year, interest rates increased creating challenges for our industry, which is highly sensitive to rate fluctuation. Even though we have a diversified geographic footprint, all of our markets were impacted by similar conditions. During '23, existing home sales declined substantially, remodeling projects were postponed and consumers traded down. New home construction was also constrained as rising interest rates and a weak housing market reduced home starts. Throughout the year, the commercial sector remained stronger than residential though investments began to slow as interest rates increased in lending types. These factors reduced industry demand across our business, creating unabsorbed overhead and shutdown costs. As a result, our industry reduced selling prices and we pass through declining cost in energy and materials."", ""Under these conditions, we focused on optimizing our revenues and lowering our costs through restructuring actions and manufacturing enhancement. We aggressively managed inventory levels, which reduced our working capital by over $300 million, excluding acquisitions. We also invested in sales resources, merchandising in new products with innovative features to inspire consumers to purchase flooring. As we integrate our recent acquisitions around the world, we are investing to improve their operations and product offering. In 2023, we completed two acquisitions in Latin America that extended our position as the world's largest ceramic tile producer and solidified our leadership in the region. In the year, we focused our capital expenditures on product innovation and cost reduction, as well as product categories that should have the highest growth as the economy improves."", ""In Europe, our porcelain slab and installation expansions are now fully operational, while in North America our premium laminate LVT projects are progressing. During the second half of this year, we anticipate completing expansion of laminate in Europe and quartz countertops in the United States. We closed the year with debt leverage of 1.5 times, free cash flow of $716 million, and available liquidity of $1.9 billion. We are retiring a term loan of approximately $900 million in quarter one, which has a higher interest rate. We are well-positioned to manage current conditions and emerge stronger from this economic cycle when the rebound occurs. Finally, in January, Newsweek recognized Mohawk as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity."", 'Our talented people are our most valuable asset and we are proud that our teams mirror the communities in which we operate. And now, Jim will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financials.', ""James Brunk: Thank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just over $2.6 billion. That's a 1.4% decrease as reported and 4.1% on a constant basis as price and mix pressures and unfavorable FX offset limited year-over-year volume improvement. Gross margin on an adjusted basis was 24.7% versus 22.4% in the prior year. The improvement is due to lower inflation, offsetting unfavorable price and mix along with increased productivity, partially offset by the impact of FX. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 18% on an adjusted basis, which was in line with the prior year. That gives us an operating income as reported of 6.4%. On an adjusted basis, 6.7% versus 4.5% in the prior year as lower inflation of $156 million offset unfavorable price and mix of $127 million as well as productivity gains of $57 million only were partially offset by unfavorable FX of $22 million."", ""Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.3% in the current year. We expect Q1 2024's tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22%, and the full year 2024 to be between 18.5% and 20.5%. That gives us an earnings per share on an adjusted basis for the quarter of $1.96. Turning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of just under $1 billion. That's a 0.6% increase as reported, or 4.7% decrease on a constant legacy basis, with all geographies seeing increased pressure in price and mix, driven by lower demand and decreases in energy costs. Operating margin on adjusted basis was 4.8% versus 7% in the prior year, due to unfavorable price/mix of $41 million, only partially offset by lower energy and material costs of $29 million."", ""Unfavorable FX of $13 million and a reduced sales volume of $10 million accounted for the balance of the decrease in the year-over-year margins and were only partially offset by productivity gains of $17 million. Flooring North America had sales of just over $900 million. That's a 3.6% decrease as reported, as demand levels and tight budgets continue to pressure pricing and mix. Our commercial category outperformed residential led by the hospitality channel. In this environment, we are focused on new innovative products which are being well received and position us to take advantage of the pent up demand. Operating margin on adjusted basis was 6.9% and significantly ahead of the breakeven margin in the prior year, due to lower inflation of $73 million, especially in material costs, offsetting the weakness in price and mix of $37 million."", ""Also benefiting our results were gains in productivity of $29 million. In Flooring Rest of the World, sales were just over $700 million for the quarter. That's a 1.5% decrease as reported and 4% on a legacy constant basis. Stronger volume in insulation, resilient and laminate were offset by continued price and mix pressures in all product categories. Consumer sentiment in Europe continues to be impacted by geopolitical events combined with higher interest rates, which is limiting remodeling activity and increasing the competitive environment. Operating margins on adjusted basis were 10.6% versus 7.7% in the prior year due to lower inflation of $59 million, offsetting unfavorable price/mix of $49 million. Productivity gains of $12 million and higher sales volume of $10 million also contributed to the year-over-year improvement in operating performance, only partially offset by unfavorable FX of $9 million."", 'Corporate eliminations for the quarter were $11 million. And in 2024, we expect them to be approximately $43 million to $48 million. Finally, turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $643 million for the quarter with free cash flow of $56 million in Q4 and $716 million for the full year. Inventories were just shy of $2.6 billion, with total inventory reduction of approximately $300 million, excluding acquisitions with a reduction of eight days versus the prior year to 130 days. Property, plant and equipment were just shy of $5 billion with Q4 CapEx of $240 million and the full year at $613 million and D&A of $630 million. The company plans to reduce CapEx by approximately 20% to $480 million in 2024 with D&A of approximately $610 million.', 'The balance sheet and cash flow of Mohawk remained very strong with gross debt of $2.7 billion and leverage of 1.5 times, positioning the company well for the market rebound. Now, Chris will review our Q4 operational performance.', ""Chris Wellborn: Thank you, Jim. In our Global Ceramic segment, industry volume remains low, which is compressing prices and margins. All of our geographies are experiencing similar competitive conditions and the industry passed through declining energy costs. We're managing our production to align with demand and have significantly reduced inventory throughout the year. To enhance our mix, we are introducing stylized products in large and small sizes, tailored to each market. To contain costs, we have increased productivity, reduced overhead and implemented alternative formulation. In the US, we are expanding our distribution through our local service centers and offering new collections with premium Italian styling to improve our product mix."", ""We're expanding our quartz countertop business with innovative new introductions and increasing our participation in the retail kitchen, bath and DIY channel. We've integrated Vitromex in Mexico and Elizabeth in Brazil and are enhancing our sales, marketing and operational strategy. In both countries, demand significantly declined last year due to rising interest rates and slowing economic conditions which reduced our results. Combined with our legacy businesses, these acquisitions give us leading positions in Brazil and Mexico. In Europe, gas prices have continued to decline and are improving our competitive position. We are optimizing our recent expansion of premium porcelain slabs in Italy to meet growing demand in both the residential and commercial channels."", ""In our Flooring Rest of the World business, our improved results in the quarter were driven by lower input cost and productivity gains, offsetting pricing pressure and foreign exchange. The European building product category remains under stress, with consumers remaining cautious and retailers reducing their inventory levels. We are investing in new products for 2024, while implementing tight cost control. We are reenergizing our flagship Quick-Step brand with interactive displays. We are completing the transition to rigid LVT and we have decommissioned our residential flexible line. As material and energy costs decline, we've reduced prices across our product categories in response to the competitive market. In insulation, we have recently experienced material increases and are raising our prices accordingly."", 'Our wood panels performance has declined during the year from typically high pricing to a more competitive environment with excess capacity. We continue to implement restructuring actions and enhance our smaller bolt-on acquisitions in insulation, MDF boards, sheet vinyl, and mezzanine flooring. In Flooring North America, fourth quarter profitability improved significantly over last year with benefits from decreased input costs, restructuring, and productivity gain. Reduced market volumes led to low industry utilization rate and aggressive competition in the marketplace. We are continuing to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to expand our distribution and improve our long-term growth. To enhance our business, we are making capital investments to increase our differentiated features and lower our manufacturing costs.', ""In each product category, we are introducing innovative new collections, which are being well-accepted. We have already begun installing our new displays with retailers around the country to accelerate the sales of these product launches. We have created the next generation of LVT with our SolidTech premier collection featuring new technology that enhances visuals with higher definition color and texture. We've also introduced a new flooring category called PureTech which is PVC-free. It is an alternative to LVT made from renewable polymer core that is waterproof and made with 70% recycled content. The commercial channel outperformed our expectation led by the hospitality sector. We are leveraging our customer relationships to expand our needle punch flooring and trim acquisitions."", ""With that, I'll return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks."", 'Jeff Lorberbaum: Thank you, Chris. As we enter 2024, the industry is at a cyclical low and we expect quarter one seasonality to be more aligned with long-term historical levels. Our businesses are minimizing their expenses, reducing the overhead and restructuring to adapt to the present conditions. We are continuing to invest in innovative products to increase our sales and mix. We are reacting to competitive pressures to optimize our volumes as we pass through the declines in our input costs. We continue to manage our inventory and anticipate temporary shutdowns to align with demand. Our businesses are implementing initiatives to enhance our processes to reduce the impact of inflation. Given these factors, we anticipate our first quarter EPS to be between $1.60 and $1.70, excluding any restructuring charges.', ""Over the past 18 months, we've initiated many actions across the company to improve our cost structure, manage our lower volumes, and integrate our recent acquisitions. We've closed four manufacturing facilities and a number of higher-cost production line, consolidated administrative functions and reduced overall headcount. When complete, these actions will collectively decrease our operating costs by approximately $150 million with about half of this already realized. Combined with our actions, improving industry conditions as we emerge from the bottom of the cycle should improve our results in the second half of the year. We anticipate central banks will lower interest rate, expanding home sales, residential remodeling, and commercial projects."", 'The pace of improvement of the flooring category will be dependent on inflation rates, consumer confidence and the strength of home sales. We believe the US and Latin American markets should improve sooner than Europe given the current geopolitical pressures. Historically, remodeling activity has led the flooring industry out of downturns, followed by new home construction with commercial projects taking longer, given the time to plan and complete. After past housing recessions, our industry has expanded with increased sales and margins for multiple years. Housing remains in short supply across all our geographies and increased remodeling investments will be required to update that aging housing stock. Our restructuring actions, investments in new technology, targeted expansions and recent acquisitions will enable us to further expand our business.', ""As the world's largest flooring company, we believe we are uniquely positioned to improve our results as the market recovers. We'll now be glad to take your questions."", 'See also 15 US States with the Least Debt Per Capita and 30 Most Densely Populated Cities in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of our website to find the press release, related financial tables and slides that follow today's discussion.On today's call, I'm joined by Herve, Barry, Pablo, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks and will participate in the Q&A. I would like to point out that we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.I will now hand the call over to Herve."", 'Herve Hoppenot', ""Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. So on Slide 5, we achieved another strong year with 2023 product and royalty revenues growing 14% versus 2022 to reach $3.7 billion, continuing the strong performance we have delivered since 2018.We also achieved a symbolic milestone in the fourth quarter. Total product and royalty revenue reached $1 billion quarterly for the first time, driven by the continued growth of Jakafi and successful launch of Opzelura.So moving to Slide 6. 2023, Jakafi net sales were $2.6 billion, growing 8% versus the prior year, with growth across all indications year-over-year. And Opzelura showed strong momentum in 2023, growing 162% to $338 million, driven by new patient and refills in both AD and vitiligo. We expect Opzelura to continue to be a key contributor to growth in the next year.On Slide 7, our clinical pipeline has the ability to deliver transformative therapies to patients across multiple programs and provides the opportunity for 10 high-impact launches by 2030, as presented recently in San Francisco.Importantly, some of the programs highlighted on this slide are derisked as they are post proof of concept including axatilimab, which has been submitted to the FDA for approval, RUX cream in pediatric atopic dermatitis to be submitted to the FDA by midyear, RUX cream in HS, where we have randomized Phase II data and povorcitinib, where we are in Phase III in HS, vitiligo, and in PN, where we are on track to initiate a Phase III study this year.Each of these programs has the potential to address a significant market and provide an opportunity to contribute to the top line before the end of the decade. I would also like now to highlight the recent transaction with MorphoSys on Slide 8. As described in the press release we issued last week, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with MorphoSys, which gave us exclusive global rights for tafasitamab, also known as Monjuvi or Minjuvi.This acquisition provides a number of benefits to Incyte in the short term. First, going forward, we will now record all revenues from Monjuvi in the U.S., while eliminating MorphoSys share of the royalties ex-U.S. and all future milestones to MorphoSys.Second, we will realize significant operating efficiencies and cost synergies in U.S. commercialization and in global development by removing redundant position and redundant external expenses and by simplifying the (inaudible). Therefore, in 2024, this deal will add to Incyte's revenue and will have a limited impact on operating income.For the future, while the currently approved indication of relapsed refractory DLBCL represents a smaller opportunity for tafasitamab, we see upside potential in second-line follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma with Phase III data expected later this year and in first-line DLBCL, for which Phase III data are expected in 2025.These programs have been co-founded by MorphoSys until now, and if positive, Incyte will fully benefit from the upside from this indication. And this acquisition will be value-accretive for Incyte in all scenarios.I will now turn the call over to Barry, who will discuss our commercial performance in more detail."", 'Barry P. Flannelly', ""Thank you, Herve, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Jakafi on Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, Jakafi net product revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $695 million and grew 8% for the full year to $2.6 billion. Total patients increased 6% in 2023, with growth being seen across all indications. We experienced some variation in Jakafi dynamics during the fourth quarter, including an increase in patients on free drug as well as in inventory fluctuations.Recall inventory drew down modestly in Q3 and rebounded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we anticipate the increase in patients on free drug seen at the end of 2023 to reverse and return to more normalized levels through 2024, supported by the lower out-of-pocket expenses under the Part D redesign.Christiana will provide more details on these dynamics in her prepared remarks. We continue and we expect continued growth of Jakafi and have updated the full year net product revenue guidance for 2024 to a range of $2.69 billion to $2.75 billion.As highlighted on Slide 11, Jakafi continues to maintain its leadership and market share in MF, driven by its unmatched product profile. Based on market research, other competitors have not had an impact on Jakafi in regards to total patient market share or new patients and is consistent with our expectations. Jakafi demand remains strong, and we expect continued future growth driven by maintaining its leadership as standard of care in myelofibrosis, growth opportunities in polycythemia vera and chronic graft versus host disease as well as earlier use in chronic GVHD.Additionally, we anticipate the positive changes in out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare Part D patients to contribute to the growth in the coming years with the biggest impact starting in 2025.Turning to Slide 12 and Opzelura fourth quarter performance. Opzelura net product revenues in the fourth quarter were $109 million, up 78% when compared to the same quarter last year. Total 2023 full year net sales grew 162% versus 2022 to reach $338 million. U.S. patient demand increased during the quarter with total prescriptions growing 77% year-over-year and refills growing by 22% versus the prior quarter.The weekly prescription trend, as shown on the right, demonstrates typical end of Q4 dynamics as well as the continued growth of Opzelura, which is coming from both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.In AD, growth was primarily driven by Opzelura's efficacy and impact on inflammation and itch. In vitiligo, where Opzelura is the only approved treatment for repigmentation, growth was driven largely by refills, improved access and our educational initiatives. We remain very optimistic about the long-term potential of Opzelura as we continue to see strong uptake.The launch continues to be strong and is gaining positive momentum with both physicians and patients as Opzelura becomes established as one of the best recent dermatology launches. Looking at the first 27 months post FDA approval, Opzelura continues to outperform other dermatology products on a launch-aligned basis when measured by monthly dermatologists prescribe TRxs on the left and when comparing quarterly net revenues on the right.The successful launch of Opzelura is driven by its compelling product profile, its ability to address significant unmet need in both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo and our strong market access relative to competition, where we continue to improve access and growing net sales.Turning to Slide 14. We have a number of initiatives in place for Opzelura to drive demand in 2024 in both AD and vitiligo. We know that based on Opzelura's compelling efficacy and safety, health care professionals want to use Opzelura sooner in the treatment algorithm. In addition to securing improved access for 2024, we are also continuing to look for ways to improve utilization management, and we have an exceptional value proposition that supports these advancements.For vitiligo, we continue to drive patient awareness through consistent marketing campaigns with the goal of educating and inspiring these patients with positive real-world patient experiences. We believe this will drive further demand and activate patients to discuss treatment options with their dermatologist.With that, I'll turn the call over to Pablo."", 'Pablo J. Cagnoni', ""Thank you, Barry, and good morning, everyone. I want to highlight some of the key R&D milestones that we accomplished in 2023 and to provide a framework for how we are evolving our R&D focus with the near-term goals to increase the rigor of our decision-making accelerate the progression of our pipeline and to optimize our resource allocation.As you can see on Slide 16, we have 3 areas of focus where we're building a robust and diverse portfolio of medicines for the treatment of MPNs in graft versus host disease, oncology and inflammatory diseases. We're advancing a pipeline to deliver impactful innovation with a focus on best-in-class and/or first-in-class differentiated medicines in areas with large unmet medical needs.Our discovery process is targeting pathway-centric and leverage its cross-program knowledge and deep biology expertise in our established disease areas of interest to identify and prosecute novel targets as well as disease and genotype-specific dependencies with a modality agnostic approach.In addition to our established small molecules expertise, we have expanded our drug discovery capabilities to include monoclonal antibody discovery in-house and have access to bispecific antibody discovery capabilities through a partnership with Merus.Turning now to Slide 17. We made significant advancements across all 3 priority areas of focus in the R&D portfolio in 2023. In MPNs and graft versus host disease, we submitted the BLA for axatilimab for the treatment in third-line chronic graft versus host disease.We presented updates for our BET and ALK2 inhibitors in MF and highlighted our new potentially transformative therapies for MF, PV and ET, our mutant collar monoclonal antibody, which is enrolling well in a Phase I study and our JAK2V617F inhibitor, for which we plan to initiate a Phase I study in the next month.In oncology, we initiated several monotherapy and combination studies with our small molecule oral PD-L1 inhibitor and highlighted early signs of clinical activity with our small molecule CDK2 inhibitor. Additionally, we unveiled a new program in development, our KRASG12D inhibitor, which entered the clinic earlier this year. Steven will provide more detail on the KRASG12D program in his prepared remarks.In dermatology, we continue to maximize the potential of ruxolitinib cream. In 2023, Opzelura was approved in Europe for Vitiligo as the first and only approved treatment for repigmentation. We also presented positive Phase III data in pediatric atopic dermatitis and announce that the primary endpoint was met in a randomized Phase II study in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa.For povorcitinib, we presented positive randomized Phase II data in vitiligo and initiated 2 Phase III studies for patients with extensive vitiligo. We also announced that povorcitinib had met the primary endpoint in a randomized Phase II study in patients with prurigo nodularis and we initiated 2 randomized Phase II studies, many patients with asthma and patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.We believe that with ruxolitinib cream and povorcitinib, we'll be the only company with the ability to address a broad spectrum of patients from mild to severe, potentially providing both topical and oral option for a number of indications, including prurigo nodularis, hidradenitis suppurativa and vitiligo.Apart from an exhaustive list of all the R&D achievements in the past year, this demonstrates that 2023 was a very successful impactful year for Incyte and it serves as a foundation for a number of pivotal trials that will deliver results in the next few years.As you can see from Slide 18, we anticipate that 2024 will be another very exciting year with multiple clinical and regulatory milestones. Steven will provide more details on these, but I would like to highlight certain events. Within our oncology pipeline, we believe that our potentially best-in-class CDK2 inhibitor is an active agent and we look forward to sharing data as well as our development plan later this year.In addition, the pivotal trial of tafasitamab in patients with follicular and marginal zone lymphoma, also known as inMIND, will read out later this year, and we look forward to sharing those results. We submitted a BLA for axatilimab late last year and we look forward to working with the FDA to make axatilimab available to patients with chronic graft versus host disease later this year and to initiate additional combination studies in patients with less pretreated chronic graft versus host disease. Within our dermatology portfolio, we expect to submit the sNDA for Opzelura for pediatric atopic dermatitis and expect multiple data readouts throughout the year.With that, I would like to pass the call to Steven, who will provide further details on our clinical development pipeline."", 'Steven H. Stein', ""Thank you, Pablo. Starting on Slide 20. In December, we presented more than 40 hematology and oncology abstracts, including a plenary presentation at the ASH Annual Meeting. Key highlights included a plenary scientific session, which featured the full data from AGAVE-201 evaluating axatilimab, an anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody in patients with chronic graft versus host disease and additional data from the Phase I/II study of zilurgisertib. Phase I data from our BET inhibitor and preclinical data of the JAK2 V617F inhibitor.While BET inhibitor, dose escalation is ongoing in monotherapy and in combination therapy we are seeing reductions in spleen length and volume as well as improvements in both symptoms and hemoglobin, suggesting that this is an active compound. We plan on advancing this program to Phase III later this calendar year.As we get closer, we will provide additional details on study design and timing. Based on the efficacy and favorable safety profile, seeming the Phase II AGAVE-201 pivotal study, the BLA for axatilimab was submitted to the FDA for approval for the treatment of patients with chronic graft versus host disease. We anticipate the decision by the FDA in the second half of 2024 and are excited by the possibility of bringing a new treatment option to these patients.We continue to expand and advance our IAI and dermatology portfolio, as seen on Slide 22. For ruxolitinib cream, we recently presented positive Phase III data in pediatric patients, where RUX cream meets its efficacy endpoints for both investigator global assessment treatment success and EZ75. We expect to submit the sNDA by the middle of 2024 with potential approval in 2025.We also disclosed that RUX cream met the primary endpoint in the Phase II study in mild to moderate hidradenitis suppurativa and we expect to present those results at a medical conference later this year, while a Phase III study has been evaluated. Ruxolitinib cream is also currently being evaluated in 3 Phase III studies in prurigo nodularis and 2 Phase II studies in lichen planus and lichen sclerosus with data expected for both later this year.Povorcitinib, our oral JAK1 inhibitor is currently being evaluated in Phase III studies in hidradenitis suppurativa and vitiligo, and we have recently announced that povorcitinib met the primary endpoint of a greater than or equal to a 4-point improvement in the itch NRS across all 3 treatment groups in a Phase II study in prurigo nodularis.We expect the full data set at a medical conference later this year and Phase III planning is underway. Our earlier stage dermatology program, our IL-15 receptor beta antibody has begun evaluation in healthy volunteers.Moving to Slide 23. Last week at the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation Conference, we presented additional data from the open-label extension of the Phase II study of povorcitinib in HS. As a reminder, povorcitinib demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in patients with HS during the initial placebo-controlled period at week 16.The data presented demonstrated that treatment with povorcitinib through week 52 resulted in a decrease in disease severity, as classified by the international HS Severity Scoring System, or IHS-4. At week 52, a significant decrease in disease severity was observed with approximately 25% of patients achieving an IHS4 score of 0, which represents the complete resolution of abscess, nodule and draining tunnels.On Slide 24, an additional analysis was maintenance of response, which demonstrates that povorcitinib treated patients who achieved a response at week 16 were likely to maintain the HiSCR response through week 52. Both of these data sets build upon povorcitinib's potential as a best-in-disease medicine for patients suffering from HS. As a reminder, 2 Phase III studies evaluating povorcitinib in HS stop HS1 and stop HS2 are ongoing and enrolling very well.Our high potential oncology pipeline is currently focused on 3 advanced programs. The first is tafasitamab, which has currently been evaluated in 2 Phase III studies in patients with follicular and marginal zone lymphoma and in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We're expecting Phase III results for follicular and marginal zone lymphoma or the inMIND study in the second half of this year with a first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or Front-MIND study readout in 2025.The second is our small molecule oral PD-L1 program. We have multiple ongoing studies as monotherapy or in combination with other agents such as axitinib, adagrasib and ipilimumab. And we expect to have combination data later this calendar year. And the third program is our small molecule CDK2 inhibitor, where we recently announced early signs of clinical activity with multiple patients demonstrating partial responses. We expect to share data as well as the development plan later this calendar year.On Slide 26, we recently announced that INCB161734, a potent, selective and orally available KRASG12D inhibitor, recently entered the clinic in a Phase I study. This program has shown encouraging preclinical antitumor activity in xenograft models with no currently approved G12D targeting agents could address a high unmet need.As a reminder, the KRASG12D mutation is found in approximately 40% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 15% of colorectal cancer and 5% of non-small cell lung cancer and could thus represent a significant opportunity for Incyte, if successful.In summary, we anticipate a number of upcoming pipeline updates in 2024, including sharing top line results from both the Phase II studies in RUX cream in HS and povorcitinib in PN at a medical conference in the first half of this year. The second half of the year is looking to be a catalyst-rich period as highlighted on Slide 20 that we anticipate includes, but is not limited to an approval with axatilimab, Phase III results from tafasitamab and the initiation of a number of Phase III studies, including with our BET inhibitor.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update."", 'Christiana Stamoulis', ""Thank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was another year of strong financial performance with total product revenues of $862 million for the fourth quarter of the year and $3.2 billion for the full year, representing a 13% and 15% year-over-year increase, respectively.Total royalty revenues, which are primarily comprised of royalties from Novartis for Jakavi and Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly for Olumiant were $150 million in the fourth quarter and $523 million for the full year, up 13% and 8%, respectively, compared to 2022. Total revenues grew 9% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, reaching the $1 billion mark, an important milestone for Incyte. For the full year, total revenues were $3.7 billion.Turning to Jakafi on Slide 30. Jakafi net product revenues were $695 million for the fourth quarter and $2.6 billion for the full year 2023. In 2023, Jakafi net sales grew 8% compared to the prior year. Jakafi sales were negatively impacted by a significant increase in free drug in the fourth quarter of the year, driven by an increase in the number of patients seeking support from Incyte's patient assistance program.The impact of the increase in free drug was more than offset by an increase in channel inventory levels. This increase was in anticipation of patients moving into paid demand starting in Q1 of 2024. The increase in Q4 channel inventory levels represented $46 million in sales.Turning now to Opzelura. Net product revenues for the fourth quarter were $109 million, representing a 78% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by increased patient demand. For the full year, total Opzelura net product revenues were $338 million, representing a 162% increase compared to the prior year.Moving on to Slide 32 and our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Total R&D expenses were $444 million for the quarter, representing an 11% year-over-year decrease, which was primarily as a result of the $70 million upfront payment made as part of the Villaris acquisition in Q4 2022 and partially offset by the $20 million development milestone payment to former Villaris shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2023.For the full year 2023, total R&D expenses were $1.6 billion, representing a 3% year-over-year increase. This increase was primarily due to the progression of our pipeline and was mainly offset by lower upfront and milestone expenses in '23.Total SG&A expenses were $294 million for the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion for the year. The year-over-year increase of 8% for the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year were mainly due to increased sales and marketing activities for Opzelura in both the U.S. and Europe, unfavorable effects and timing of certain G&A-related expenses.Moving on to 2024. I will now discuss the key components of our guidance on a GAAP basis, which includes revenues and expenses related to the recent acquisition of the exclusive global rights to tafasitamab, but excludes any potential impact related to the accounting treatment of the $25 million purchase price paid.For Jakafi, we expect net product revenues to be in the range of $2.69 billion to $2.75 billion on track to achieve our long-term guidance of over $3 billion in net product revenues by 2028. We expect net product revenue growth to be driven exclusively by continued demand growth and be partially offset by lower net pricing as a result of IRA imposed price increase caps and continued growth in 340B volumes.As in previous years, we expect the gross-to-net adjustment to be higher in the first quarter of the year relative to the previous quarter and subsequent quarters due to the higher deductibles and our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients, which are primarily impacting the first quarter of the year.While for Opzelura, we will not be providing full year guidance at this point, in the first quarter, we expect to see again the effects of typical Q1 dynamics on net sales, including higher patient out-of-pocket costs due to the planned deductibles resetting at the beginning of the year and the impact of holidays, medical conferences and other events on dermatology product sales.As of a result, Q1 Opzelura net product revenues are expected to be below the previous quarter and the subsequent quarters and represent a smaller share of the full year net product revenues consistent with what we saw in 2023.For other hematology/oncology products, which now include Iclusig, Pemazyre, Monjuvi and Minjuvi, we expect total net product revenues to be in the range of $325 million to $360 million, which at the midpoint represents approximately 47% growth over '23.Turning to operating expenses on a GAAP basis. We expect COGS to range from 7% to 8% of net product revenues, which is in line with 2023. R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.76 billion, representing 7% growth at the midpoint versus 2023, primarily driven by the progression of our pipeline.We expect SG&A expense for the year to be in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.24 billion, representing 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint primarily driven by the inclusion of sales and marketing expenses associated with Monjuvi in the U.S. under SG&A whereas prior to the acquisition of full product rights, they were included under the collaboration profit or loss share.Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call to Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Srikripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities.', 'Srikripa Devarakonda', 'On Jakafi and myelofibrosis, thank you so much for providing the market share details on our patients and the share in your patients. I was just wondering if you anticipate stabilization of classified share at these levels? And if collaborative were to be approved in combination with rock assuming it happens sometime next year, should we expect to see an inflection point.', 'Barry P. Flannelly', ""So stabilization of market share in myelofibrosis. So Jakafi, as you know, is the leader in myelofibrosis because of its safety, efficacy, overall survival and really tolerability, which is really a big advantage. We think that myelofibrosis will continue to be the largest portion of our patient share until polycythemia vera patients ultimately take over because as you know, those patients stay on for a long period of time.Your question around parsaclisib if and when gets approved in combination with Jakafi. Of course, that's a good thing for us. If in fact, the profile of the drug is as it appears or the combination as it appears, then many physicians may choose to use that combination and Jakafi will only benefit, but we have to wait and see what happens with the approval process."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Andrew Berens from Leerink.', 'Andrew Scott Berens', ""Wondering if you guys could expand upon the development of Jakafi XR in light of the recently announced bid by Novartis from MorphoSys. Does Novartis' control of Jakafi outside the U.S. impact how you're thinking about developing your BET inhibitor. Do they have any direction or say in any of the directions of the XR version of Jakafi? And then also just wondering if you think that an add-on drug to Jakafi and MS still requires a symptomatic improvement as an endpoint for regulatory endorsement. Or do you think that there's been a material change in thinking at the agency?"", 'Herve Hoppenot', 'So let me take the piece about our agreement with Novartis on Jakafi and Steven can speak about the development of XR. So the agreement is such that both parties can be co-developing new formulations of ruxolitinib in oncology, including the once a day. It has not been the case yet, but there is still an optionality for Novartis to co-develop XR if they wish, and that would mean that they would be able to commercialize the XR formulation outside of the U.S. but not in the U.S. where, obviously, it will be commercialized by Incyte.', 'Steven H. Stein', ""And then, Andy, I'll take the other part of your question. So for RUX XR, as Pablo communicated at the ASH Investor event, we have now clear feedback from the FDA that we need to do a new formulation strength, which are already developed, which are slightly higher and then demonstrate the EBA with those primarily around (inaudible) and AUC. That's the clear guidance from the FDA. And we estimate this should be completed in a 2-year process so well before the LOE. It doesn't affect our development of FTCs, fixed-dose combinations with any of our products. So that continues.For our BET inhibitor, again, we showed data at ASH and alluded in my prepared remarks, we have clearly an active compound showing in very good rates of spleen reduction, both volume and length, very good symptom improvement and occasional hemoglobin increases, just like seen with the other BET inhibitor.We have been operating like other companies under the assumption that at least in first line, you need SVR35 and symptoms to date to get approvals. I can't comment on where they are in their regulatory progresses or how the FDA may change in that regard. But that has been the standard to date."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today is coming from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim.', 'Michael Werner Schmidt', 'I had 1 on povorcitinib. So as we think about the opportunity for this drug in multiple indications, I believe the HS Phase III trial is most advanced. Could you talk a bit about your expectation on how the drug may be positioned relative to some of the biologics in HS, be it Humira or some of the IL-17 antibodies.And then also in PN where you had the positive top line data last year, Dupixent is obviously approved here again, could you talk a bit about how the drug might be fitting into that treatment paradigm relative to Dupixent?', 'Steven H. Stein', ""Michael, it's Steven. I'll start with your question. Thank you for the question. So povorcitinib HS, we think we have outstanding efficacy data, which we've now updated with a 52-week data that shows prolonged effect that's maintained and so remember, this is a JAK1 specific agent, about 50-fold selective for JAK1 has a long half-life and a very high volume of distribution, which may translate to more penetration in the skin, which is why we see this degree of efficacy showing to date. Both Phase III STOP-HS1 and HS2 are enrolling very, very well.So that probably speaks to also some of the belief out there in the agent, and that is clearly our lead indication as you alluded to. It's hard to always cross-compare with many caveats to other studies where the drugs aren't directly compared and you spoke about the IL-17 here and the biologics, and clearly, there's some variable activity there.You have to look at placebo corrected rates. But I think tackles multiple aspects of the disease pathophysiology, not just 1 interleukin. And as I said, the drug profile with a long half-life and high volume of distribution may lend itself to increased efficacy here.Obviously, time will tell with the Phase III data. It will be a once daily oral tablet, which offers that sort of convenience. In PN, when patients suffer from primarily is intense itching. And again, our Phase II proof of concept data is very strong in terms of the itch relief here and the ability to eliminate that symptom pretty quickly as well as over time, disease resolution in the actual skin manifestations.There is, as you allude to an approved agent there in Dupixent but that has provided us the regulatory pathway on the way to go in terms of itch resolution and skin change resolution. And again, we'll offer the once-daily oral convenience, we think we'll have a really good agent in terms of high efficacy there. So we're excited about this program as well."", 'Operator', 'Your next question today is coming from Vikram Purohit from Morgan Stanley.', 'Vikram Purohit', ""We had 2 on the pipeline. So first, for the ALK2 program, you've guided to POC data by mid-'24. We were just wondering what we can expect to learn with this update and what you will be reviewing specifically to decide what the next step of development could be for this program? And then secondly, for the mutant CALR antibody. When can we expect to see initial Phase I data there? And what are you hoping to establish to get conviction that the program is headed in the right direction."", 'Pablo J. Cagnoni', ""Yes. Thank you for the question. This is Pablo. So for the ALK2 inhibitor program, what we're in the process of doing, and we need to establish is efficacy in a larger number of patients with newly diagnosed MF in combination with ruxolitinib. And that's what the team is focused on right now, and as we mentioned, at ASH last December.So we continue to push the dose. We need to get to doses of around 400 to 600 milligrams a day in order to get the maximum effect on hepcidin. Two, we need longer duration of therapy in a larger group of patients in combination with RUX.So that will happen over the course of the year. We haven't provided a specific time line for when we're going to disclose the data. But as we mentioned at ASH last year, it would happen this year. And we'll provide clarity on what the next steps for that program are.On the second question for the mutant CALR antibody program, we started dose escalation very recently. As you know, that study is accruing very well. The initial goals like for any first-in-human study, obviously, to establish that this monoclonal antibody is safe, get a good view of the pharmacokinetics in this first-in-human study and establish initial evidence of efficacy, which, in this case, will be by traditional endpoints in MPNs and also potentially a view on the effect of the mutant CALR or monoclonal antibody on a real burden in some of these patients. That will happen over the course of the year. We haven't decided yet when we're going to present data, whether it's this year, whether at some point in 2025."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.', 'This is (inaudible) on for Salveen. We had 1 question on Opzelura outside of the 1Q dynamics that you spoke to. Can you help us understand the forward launch trajectory in AD and vitiligo in the context of reimbursement and access and also gross to net in order to be fully able to capture the opportunity as you have additional indications coming in, in the coming years.', 'Barry P. Flannelly', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. So of course, as far as launch trajectory, we're continuing to launch very well in both AD and vitiligo. We continue to expect growth in vitiligo just based upon our educational efforts directed both at patients and health care professionals. We know that the profile in AD in terms of its itch relief and clearance of the skin is unmatched for any therapy, topical therapy.We even believe that in AD, for example, the profile is so good that as far as payers are concerned, they're interested in the fact that more than 80% of the patients will be clear and have their itch relieved and can delay or not even go on to biologics.So we think those dynamics are good for both AD and vitiligo going forward and we can -- we're looking forward to future growth. I'll turn the call over to Christiana to talk about gross to net."", 'Christiana Stamoulis', ""So in terms of gross to net, first of all, when you look in 2023, the average gross to net was around 55%. Our goal is to maximize the value of Opzelura and maximize net sales. If going forward, we make the decision to provide any additional discounts, it would be because we expect that this will improve access and we'll have a disproportionate impact on volume and thus lead to higher net sales. So as such, our comments are going to be focused on net sales versus gross to net in isolation."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from Derek Archila from Wells Fargo.', 'Derek Christian Archila', 'So 1 just piggybacking on the last. Just in terms of Opzelura, is there 1 -- any chance we get an update in terms of potential guidance this year? And then will you ever look to kind of break out both kind of the vitiligo and AD kind of scripts or sales, if you could figure that out? And then secondly, just on tafasitamab I guess, can you quantify maybe the incremental growth opportunities you see for this assay in the follicular and marginal zone lymphoma indications.', 'Barry P. Flannelly', ""So as far as breaking out AD versus vitiligo, I think we've said before, it's about 60% currently for AD, 40% currently for vitiligo, it could be changing a little bit. Ultimately, we expect vitiligo total tubes perhaps surpass AD. AD patients are many new patients who have come on for atopic dermatitis and in vitiligo, it's about continued use and refills.As far as Monjuvi tafasitamab goes, obviously, we're looking forward to, hopefully, positive data in follicular lymphoma, indolent lymphoma and in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. So we think there's great opportunities ahead for these 2 indications. We think it's a great drug for lymphoma. Obviously, it's a crowded marketplace, but we think the profile of the drug and the trials we put together for those 2 new indications are going to serve us well in the future."", 'Herve Hoppenot', ""But in terms of calibration of follicular lymphoma, we need to see the Phase III data. It's a fairly competitive place. There are a lot of new products. So we need to see the Phase III data before we can give you a good calibration of that. I mean the number of patients we are speaking about in the U.S. is around..."", 'Barry P. Flannelly', ""There's 39,000 patients in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. There's about 13,000 patients in second line plus in follicular lymphoma in the United States."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from David Lebowitz from Citi.', 'David Neil Lebowitz', ""You said that the fourth quarter revenues were negatively impacted by the number of Medicare Part D patients receiving free product. Could you perhaps elaborate on this? And also looking ahead to 2024 and '25, you've spoken about how IRA dynamics could shift, which will drive PV share. Could you possibly give us some way to quantify the potential impacts of this shift over time?"", 'Barry P. Flannelly', ""So to answer the first question. In Q4, we saw a significant increase in patient seeking assistance from Incyte in the form of free drug, of course. We know that these were paid patients who had Medicare Part D and our assumption is these patients were receiving financial assistance from independent charitable foundations to cover their out-of-pocket expenses.This assistance was no longer available to them apparently at the -- towards the end of the year. And of course, they came to us and they met our eligibility criteria for free drug. With the changes in Medicare in 2024, as you know, the out-of-pocket in 2024 for Medicare Part D is greatly reduced. Therefore, we expect these patients to return to being paid patients.And in fact, we know already that many of these patients already have. In terms of 2024, 2025 and the changes to Medicare Part D, we think it's been very positive. We've been saying it for a long time that these co-pays out-of-pocket cost for patients -- cancer patients who are in Medicare Part D was very much too high and should be reduced. And in fact, they probably are still too high. But because of the way it happens in 2025, $2,000 maximum out of pockets, they can spread that out over throughout the year.So they pay about $167 per month for a 12-month period. We think that there's lots of patients perhaps over the years who have walked away who have abandoned drug because they could not afford these out-of-pocket cost. We think that there's an opportunity at least for those patients who abandon drug or just thought they could not afford the drug. Now that the Medicare Part D is greatly reduced, they could come back. So come back or option into drug therapy now. So..."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Jessica Fye from JPMorgan.', 'Jessica Macomber Fye', ""A couple of follow-ups on some of the previous questions. What's your expectation for the proportion of Jakafi patients receiving free drug in 2024? And then on Opzelura for Europe, how are you expecting the average price to shake out for vitiligo, and can you recap your latest thinking on pursuing AD there? And then in the U.S. I think you mentioned that recent script trends reflect kind of normal year-end seasonality. Is that to say you expect a volume reacceleration near term? I wasn't sure how to reconcile that with some of the other 1Q comments you made about Opzelura."", 'Barry P. Flannelly', ""Okay. I'll try to answer the first and third question, maybe ask Herve to talk about Europe. So the expectation for free drug is easy for Jakafi. It's been 3% to 4% of our volume for years and years and years. So we expect it to go back. We think this is a one-time exceptional thing that happened because of the changes coming from Medicare Part D. So again, no more than it has been historically, which is around 3% or 4% of our volume.As far as what we talked about seasonality. We do expect that the first quarter be down mostly because of out-of-pocket expenses, because of deductibles, because of resetting of the co-pays but then we should go back to our acceleration in volume in second quarter, third quarter and so on. And Herve, Europe?"", 'Herve Hoppenot', ""So in Europe today, Opzelura is launched in Germany and Austria, in fact, where it's commercially available. The price there is EUR 750 per 100-gram tube. And then we recently received reimbursement in France under the process called AXA Direct, which is a way to make -- it's one of the first product. In fact, it's the second product to get AXA -- to be part of that program. And that gives access to patients through a special distribution system and while the price is being discussed.So the price discussion will probably take 10 months and we will start booking sales or recognizing revenue in France when the price is finally approved. So that should be late this year in the best case. And then we are also in the process of getting reimbursement in other countries in Europe. So hopefully, we will get multiple countries launching in '24 and '25.Regarding atopic dermatitis, we decided, obviously, to start with vitiligo for reimbursement, reason because it's a better case leading to a better price in most of these countries. And we have ongoing studies that have been, in fact, started relatively recently that could be used if we want to have a limited level in atopic dermatitis, which would be required to be able to maintain the price. So that process is ongoing, and it's not going to lead to a new indication in the next 2 years. It will be coming October."", 'Operator', 'Next question is coming from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America.', 'Tazeen Ahmad', ""I was just curious as to the payer mix differences, if there are any for Opzelura between the AD indication versus vitiligo. And then secondly, as both of these launches start to mature a bit, do you have a better sense of how you're going to land a number of tubes on average use per patient for a full year."", 'Barry P. Flannelly', ""As far as the payer mix goes, there's no real difference between payer mix for AD. More patients perhaps have step therapies in the vitiligo. More patients don't have any steps or have 1 step. In terms of the number of tubes we've said in the past that for AD, it's around 2 tubes or a little bit more. We think that will continue to grow as people use the drug over larger portions of the body, obviously, they -- they can go up to 20% of their body surface area, which is a very large body surface area.Some people start out in sensitive areas and now they'll continue to use it over a larger area of their skin. For vitiligo, it's just too early. We'll figure out. But we're anticipating, obviously, as we've said, the refills will be much greater in vitiligo compared to AD."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from Marc Frahm from TD Cowen.', 'Marc Alan Frahm', ""Maybe following up on a couple of the payer dynamic questions. Just on Jakafi, can you quantify the level of kind of script abandonment and things like that, that you are seeing and kind of what this opportunity is for volume gains with this redesign, recognizing, yes, some of it's not going to play out over just in 1 year.And then similarly, in for Opzelura, you had some formulary wins late last year that came into effect at the beginning of the year. Christiana, to your comment of only wanting to give price concessions to see enough volume benefit to end up with a net sales benefit. Are you seeing early returns from that, that are consistent with that view? Or do you kind of need to recalibrate? How you do those negotiations for next year to make sure that, that trend is kept."", 'Barry P. Flannelly', ""Sure, Mark. Barry first. So quantified a level of script abandonment for Jakafi, we don't actually know. We know that it's at least 10% just because we know when we go to specialty pharmacies, the patients who go through specialty pharmacies, it's a little -- we have a little bit more data there or clarity there and it's at least 10%.But we don't know, people who -- scripts never get sent to a pharmacy. We don't know about that. So we're not exactly sure, but we think there's a significant portion of patients that could benefit from these -- from Jakafi specifically that aren't because of the out-of-pocket cost, and that's getting better and better all the time, we hope, in 2024 and 2025.As far as Opzelura goes and formulary wins, it's for example, CBS, Aetna, that got changed this year to preferred status with 1 step therapy for AD, no step therapies for vitiligo, it's a little bit too soon to see anything because obviously, when CBS makes a decision with us, it takes a while to funnel down to the various plans at the local level."", 'Operator', 'Next question today is coming from Ren Benjamin from Simpsons JMP.', 'Reni John Benjamin', ""Given the rumors of your bid for MorphoSys, are you considering any other acquisitions in the MS space? Or was the rumor incorrect the whole time and you were just going after TAFA that's question #1.Question #2, back to Steven on the Jakafi XR. I'm still -- I'd love to get a little bit more color on the 2 years that it takes to get to the end of this to solve this issue. What really is kind of involved? And is the probability of success, I would think it would be just quite high. It's just for the lack of a better word, an engineering problem, but maybe I'm thinking about this wrong."", 'Herve Hoppenot', ""Yes. Maybe on the first question, as I said, I think the TAFA acquisition for us is an excellent deal. It's, in fact, very, very asymmetric because it's, as I said, with all of the synergies we can realize in the short term, it can compensate for what is left in terms of development costs in these 2 indications or in fact, most of the development has already been paid for in the past year. So it is a case where the actual impact on the bottom line will be very minimal in the short term and very positive in the long term, whatever the scenario of the new indication.Now, if any of this new indication is hitting and its positive then it becomes obviously a super deal because we get all the benefit in terms of top line. So that's the aspect. Now in the field of myelofibrosis. As you can see from our pipeline, we have a number of projects that we are pursuing ourselves.We have our own bet. There is still the ALK2 program where, as Pablo was saying, there is some additional data that we need to get certainty, but it's very promising. And obviously, we have the (inaudible) program on top of the XR formulation. So all of that is giving us a very full pipeline in the field of myelofibrosis. So that would not be the first priority for acquisitions."", 'Steven H. Stein', ""And Ren, your question on XR. So just to go back to the CRL, Remember, when we did the submission, we missed on (inaudible) to a small degree that per the FDA resulted in a theoretic concern on efficacy. And then we tried to do some more population PK analysis in that to reassure them, but their pathway didn't work. And as we gave more granular detail at the end of last year, the route forward is new formulation, slightly larger tablet size and then repeat (inaudible) work -- and you're right, it's not -- doesn't take a great length of time.But to get that data in, analyze it, put it into a package and send it to the FDA and then have the discussions, an approximation of best guess is an approximately to your journey from the beginning of this year to get it done. And that, we feel, has enough conservatism in it that we should make it.In terms of probably of success, we can model from the formulations, what we will likely achieve in terms of area under the curve, (inaudible) and even actually Cmax as well. And we think that is relatively high. Obviously, that's why we're doing it. and we'll share that data as it becomes available and then take it to regulatory agencies."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets.', ""This is Navin on for Brian. We just had a couple of questions on our part. So on Opzelura, what is the latest that you're kind of seeing on patient retention so far? How many patients persisted through the 6 to 12 months so far to kind of see the benefit versus how many are kind of dropping off or perhaps seeing early efficacy. And then if you could speak to a little bit of the education around the retention strategies as well.And then a second question on the MF space. So as you kind of see the entry of additional competitors into the space, do you potentially foresee an expansion of the market as these competitors entered?"", 'Barry P. Flannelly', ""Sure, Navin, this is Barry. So -- as far as patient retention, I guess what you mean is (inaudible). So obviously, the vitiligo patients stay on for a much longer period of time. Of course, atopic dermatitis patients, patients with eczema, they have flares, they use Opzelura, it goes away, and it's very effective. So some patients get immediate relief. Obviously, we talk about the itch relief all the time, they get good itch relief and then the skin begins to clear over time.So these patients will come back, we think, year after year as long as they have their eczema and use the drug when they see the flares until it goes away and then start using it again. Vitiligo patients we've seen from our long-term data. Patients can use the drug for 2 years and continue to get benefit. So that's what we keep on reinforcing around education so that patients understand how to use the drug, what they're going to see in 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months and beyond, and that's how we'll continue to retain them.Yes, it's very important. The strategies around patients' adherence, particularly for vitiligo. And particularly, we know we can make improvements around what health care professionals, dermatologists in their offices are telling the patient how to use the drug and then the patients themselves understanding how to use the drug.As far as competitors in the MF space, I mean, there are 3 other JAK inhibitors approved for myelofibrosis, where we continue to be the market leader in myelofibrosis, will continue to be. As far as the combinations that have been studied recently, we'll see.But it certainly does expand the market because you have the opportunity of going early, earlier patients starting. We know if they start early with Jakafi, their survival advantages could be better. And then, in fact, they'll go to second-line drugs and third-line drugs. So yes, we created the market, and it could expand if there are good drugs approved after Jakafi."", 'Operator', 'Our final question today is coming from Matt Phipps from William Blair.', 'Matthew Christopher Phipps', ""I'll just ask 1 on the CDK2 inhibitor. Curious if you can comment on the safety profile you've seen so far, if you're seeing any (inaudible) cytopenia."", 'Pablo J. Cagnoni', ""Matt, thank you for the question. We have not. We are happy with the safety profile so far, which is consistent with the mechanism of CDK2 inhibition. And we have not seen ocular toxicity, which, as you know, led to a clinical hold in one of our competitors. So we're very excited about the early data of our CDK2 inhibitor as we mentioned. And we look forward to sharing data over the course of the year as well as our future development plans for the CDK2 inhibitor program."", 'Operator', ""We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments."", 'Ben Strain', ""Thank you for participating in today's call and for your questions. The IR team will be available for the rest of the day. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference webcast.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the robotics industry, head directly to 5 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Right Now.\xa0', ""In 2023, the global robotics market was valued at $46.0 billion. IMARC Group anticipates substantial growth, projecting the market to reach $169.8 billion by 2032. This forecast indicates a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.1% during the period from 2024 to 2032. The robotics market's expansion is attributed to significant technological advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, a surge in demand for automation due to increasing labor shortages and rising labor costs, government initiatives and funding, and the expanding application areas of robotics."", 'The adoption of robotics has, in fact, doubled in the last six years, setting the stage for further acceleration. According to a 2022 report by the International Federation of Robotics, at least 3.5 million industrial robots were operational in manufacturing factories worldwide as of 2021, and industrial robot installations reached an all-time high. The investment in industrial robots has been on an upward trajectory since 2010, driven by manufacturers aiming to reduce production costs. Recent developments indicate that the impact of robotics is poised to extend beyond manufacturing into different industries. Notably, in the health sciences and wellness sector, robots are increasingly being deployed in operating rooms, clinical settings, and research laboratories to automate manual, repetitive, and high-volume tasks. With evolving technologies, robots are expected to operate more autonomously, eventually performing certain tasks entirely on their own.', 'The high capital expenditure and retraining costs associated with automation through robotics have historically limited efficiency gains to larger companies. However, this scenario is changing, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The average price of an industrial robot has decreased by half over the last decade, dropping from $47,000 in 2011 to approximately $23,000 in 2022. Forecasts by ARK Invest suggest a further 50% to 60% reduction in costs by 2025. Moreover, new business models, such as robotics-as-a-service, are enhancing accessibility by mitigating upfront capex costs through lease agreements.\xa0', 'The past five years, marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, have underscored the vulnerability of globalized supply chains, especially for businesses relying on intricate components like semiconductors. In response, a significant number of European (74%) and US (70%) businesses intend to reshore or nearshore their operations, as indicated by a 2022 survey by ABB Robotics. A substantial portion of these businesses (75% in Europe and 62% in the US) plan to invest in robotic automation within the next three years. Legislative acts like the US CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act further signify the trend toward reshoring manufacturing, either through incentives or mandates. Amid widely reported labor shortages, particularly in manufacturing, there is a clear opportunity for automation and robotics. China, aggressively pursuing robotics in the last decade, surpassed the US in technology adoption in 2021, illustrating the impact of this trend.', 'Bill Gates discussed some groundbreaking robotics initiatives in a GatesNotes blog post at the beginning of 2024. The Microsoft co-founder considers developing machines that mimic human body functions, such as walking, jumping, touching, and gripping objects, to be a greater challenge than advancing artificial intelligence, which already demonstrates daily progress. Gates highlighted his enthusiasm for five robotics startups, starting with Agility Robotics, an American startup that has developed a human-centric, multipurpose robot tailored for logistics work. This robot, approximately the size of a human, can handle heavy loads and express ""emotions"" through LEDs on its face, enhancing interaction with human colleagues. Another notable initiative is from Tevel, an Israeli startup deploying autonomous flying robots for continuous selective fruit picking, ensuring ripe apples are harvested around the clock. Gates also mentioned Apptronik, whose robots have the potential to assist astronauts on Moon or Mars missions. Gates also praised the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory (RoMeLa) at UCLA for its robot capable of navigating rocky, unstable terrain without falling. Lastly, he acknowledged Field AI, a company developing AI-powered software for robots, enabling complete autonomy in various missions. Gates envisions robots, including humanoid models, playing crucial roles in responding to future natural disasters or major health crises like the Covid-19 pandemic. They could manually weed on farms, carry heavy loads in factories, and become essential in healthcare, hospitality, and household settings.', 'To benefit from the growth potential in the robotics industry, some of the best stocks to invest in include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

We recently wrapped our 2023 health tour, a mobile health screening and kidney care education program supporting local communities across the country. Today, 15% of our U.S.', 'population has kidney disease, which often goes undiagnosed and untreated until symptoms become severe.

These improved trends, combined with the strong operating performance and the positive impact on the initiatives we implemented, resulted in a 20% year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income, 28% growth in adjusted EPS, and a return of our leverage ratio back to the target range."", ""I'll share three points for additional color. First, on volume. We entered 2023 with a 2% growth headwind due to the annualization of excess mortality from prior year. Since then, successive COVID surges have been weaker in magnitude with lower mortality."", 'At the same time, we were able to produce four consecutive quarters with year-over-year growth in new patient admits. Adding these factors together, 2023 saw increased patient census for the first time since COVID started, and volume that was approximately flat year over year, landing at the top of our guidance range. Second, our labor performance in 2023 was better than 2022. We cut our reliance on contract labor more quickly than anticipated and improved staffing in our centers.', 'On the other side of the ledger, teammate turnover has remained elevated in line with the strong healthcare labor markets. Looking forward, improved retention and training costs represent an opportunity for improvement in the years ahead. Third, independent of these trends, we drove strong operating performance through our differentiated platform and capabilities. Most notably, we invested in our revenue operations to achieve sustainable improvements in our collections.', 'This resulted in an additional $3.50 in revenue per treatment for the full year while reducing more than 12 days from our U.S. day sales outstanding. Adding to this, we executed against our cost-saving initiatives related to pharmaceutical spend and further consolidated our facility footprint. Finally, we exceeded our annual profitability targets for Integrated Kidney Care, which I will cover more in detail in a moment.', 'To summarize, we entered 2024 with more visibility and confidence that we have had since the start of COVID in 2020. Our ability to invest in our people, process, and systems, despite the operational and financial challenges of the last few years, has positioned us well for the years ahead. On that note, let me transition to our value-based care business, which we will call Integrated Kidney Care or IKC. We have consistently urged our investors to assess this business on an annual basis rather than focusing on our quarterly results.', ""Now is a good time to pause and reflect on our performance and outlook of IKC. At a high level, we assess IKC performance based on three primary metrics: one, total medical expense and patients in our IKC programs, which represents growth; two, our clinical performance or effectiveness of reducing total medical costs; and three, per member per month spend on our model of care and G&A, which indicates cost management. I'll walk through each in a bit more detail. First, total medical expense of patients in our IKC programs grew to $4.6 billion, reflecting approximately 30% growth year over year."", 'This represents care for 58,000 patients as of year-end, a 38% increase from 2022. Then our traditional value-based care programs, we continue to be disciplined, prioritizing profitable growth. For 2024, we expect growth in excess of 25% for total medical expense and covered lives. Second, our model of care has proven effective in helping our patients lead healthier lives and reducing medical costs, reflecting in a net savings rate that is slightly ahead of our expectations.', 'Largest driver is year-over-year reduction in hospitalizations, especially readmission rates. This relies on our collaboration efforts between our care teams and physician partners to prevent rising acuity and address the needs of our most complex and vulnerable patients. And finally, our per member per month cost continue to trend down as a result of the program growth and improved fixed cost leverage. In 2023, our per member per month cost declined by 7%.', 'We expect per member per month cost to further decline by approximately 15% in 2024. The result of these efforts is that we outperformed our 2023 adjusted operating loss forecast, and we believe we remain on track to deliver breakeven or better performance by 2026. Beyond the core metrics, we can further break down our performance based on three primary components of our IKC business: special need plans, our value-based care portfolio focused primarily on Medicare Advantage patients and the CKCC demonstration project for our Medicare fee-for-service patients. Within that portfolio, after many years of investment and consistent year-over-year improvements in cost savings, our MA contracts and Special Need Plans have now reached profitability.', ""Keep in mind that the third component, CKCC, represents approximately 50% of our value-based care census. We adjust the changes from CMS and further optimize our model of care, we expect this program to become profitable in 2026 time frame. Before we get into 2024, I'll offer a quick comment on GLP-1. To be clear, none of our thinking has changed since our last earnings call."", 'Shortly after our call, results for the select clinical trial were released. As expected, the trial confirms certain cardiovascular benefits in people with obesity and cardiovascular disease, including a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality. Next on the near-term horizon will be the FLOW study, which we anticipate will demonstrate efficacy on multiple endpoints, including slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease. As a reminder, such efficacy that may be demonstrated in the FLOW study is already incorporated into our GLP-1 base case, Flex, a net neutral impact to dialysis volume growth as adoption ramps up over the next decade.', ""Shifting to 2024. We're setting guidance for adjusted operating income growth of 10% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%, reflecting the midpoint of our respective guidance range for each metric. This incorporates our expectations of a more predictable operating environment, continued returns from our revenue cycle investment, and further progress in IKC. This guidance demonstrates the resilience of our business and our ability, despite external challenges, to provide high-quality care while delivering strong financial results."", ""Let me touch on a few drivers of our forecast. First, 2024 adjusted operating income will benefit from the full-year impact of positive development in 2023, including the annualization of revenue cycle improvement, our transition to MIRCERA, and savings related to our center consolidation. Second, as noted, we're demonstrating progress in our IKC business and continue to expect breakeven by 2026. And finally, adjusted earnings per share will benefit from our share repurchase program, offset by other factors below the OI line, including other losses, higher interest expense, and higher effective tax rate."", ""As we turn the page to 2024, we have a great opportunity to drive operating advancements that further differentiate DaVita within kidney care. I'll now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."", 'Joel Ackerman -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Javier. In Q4, we delivered $415 million of adjusted operating income and $1.87 of adjusted earnings per share. Our strong performance for the quarter puts us just above the top end of our updated full-year guidance range from the Q3 call. Our outperformance in the quarter relative to our expectations was primarily related to prior period development in our special needs programs in our IKC business, plus revenue per treatment growth from continued improvements in our revenue cycle management.', 'In the U.S. dialysis segment, fourth-quarter treatments per day were flat versus the third quarter. As a reminder, mistreatment rates are seasonally higher in the winter months, which was offset by an improvement in our day-of-week mix relative to the third quarter. Revenue per treatment was up approximately $6 quarter over quarter.', 'About half of this was due to normal quarterly fluctuations. The remaining increase was driven equally by continued improvements in our revenue cycle management and typical fourth-quarter seasonality related to higher acute mix and reimbursement for flu vaccines. Adjusted patient care cost per treatment was up $13 sequentially, driven primarily by seasonality, including higher benefits expense and continued investment in our teammates. This sequential increase was higher than typical for Q4 but in line with our expectations described on our Q3 earnings call.', 'In our IKC business, adjusted operating results were down $39 million sequentially due primarily to timing of shared services revenue recognized in Q3 primarily from arrangements from 2022. Additionally, in Q4, we recognized incremental shared savings revenue of $55 million associated with Medicare Advantage value-based care arrangements for plan year 2023. This is earlier than we had previously anticipated recognizing revenue for 2023 arrangements and is the result of the clearing of several revenue recognition hurdles earlier than otherwise anticipated. This revenue would have otherwise been recorded in 2024.', 'As a result, we now anticipate that our recognition of shared savings revenue for our Medicare Advantage contracts in 2024 and beyond will generally align with the plan year in which they are earned. Although there will likely continue to be updates in our estimates during each planned year and beyond until final reconciliation. This $55 million shared savings revenue recognized in 2023 has been excluded from our adjusted operating income as it represents earnings incremental to what would have been expected in 2023 absent the change. International adjusted operating income was down $18 million quarter over quarter.', 'The largest component of this sequential change was driven by an increase in bad debt reserves. Transitioning to capital structure. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares and since the start of 2024, we repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares. We ended 2023 with zero balance on our revolving credit facility and our leverage ratio declined slightly to 3.15 times consolidated EBITDA, below the midpoint of our target leverage range.', 'The strong free cash flow was partly the result of continued reduction of our U.S. dialysis DSOs, which ended the quarter at 54 days, down three days from last quarter and 12 days below the level at the end of 2022. Turning now to detail on 2024 guidance. Our adjusted operating income guidance for the year is $1.825 billion to $1.975 billion, representing 9.6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.', 'This is above our long-term expectation of 3% to 7% growth in adjusted operating income, driven by higher revenue per treatment growth in typical as a result of our investments in our revenue cycle management and cost savings in our nonlabor patient care costs due to annualization of MIRCERA and footprint-related cost savings. To give you more detail, let me first cover the three main drivers of U.S. dialysis growth versus 2023. First, we expect treatment volume growth of 1% to 2%.', 'This is the result of continued new patient admissions growth on par with pre-pandemic averages, partially offset by mortality that is expected to remain slightly higher than pre-COVID levels. Second, we anticipate revenue per treatment growth of 2.5% to 3%. Approximately two-thirds of this growth is due to rate increases. The remaining third of the expected increase is primarily from annualization of the revenue cycle management improvements we saw in 2023.', 'Third, we expect adjusted patient care cost per treatment to increase 2.5% to 3%. We continue to expect wages to increase at rates above pre-COVID levels. Savings to offset this include leverage of fixed costs as treatment volume grows and annualization of cost savings initiatives in 2023, including our conversion to MIRCERA for anemia management and our center consolidation efforts. Let me mention a couple of other items to help your thinking with U.S.', 'dialysis. We expect adjusted depreciation and amortization to decline by approximately $10 million to $15 million, a marked change from historical increases of approximately $20 million annually. This is the delayed result of our consistent effort over many years to increase our capital efficiency. As it relates to policy matters, we do not expect to spend the $50 million to $60 million related to ballot measures that would have been typical of past election years.', ""For IKC, our guidance assumes an adjusted operating income loss of approximately $50 million. This reflects our expectation of continued growth in total medical spend and covered lives within our IKC programs, improved shared savings performance, and further fixed cost leverage, as outlined in Javier's earlier comments. In our international business, we incorporated in our guidance continued growth in adjusted operating income of approximately $20 million year over year. Below the OI line, we expect losses of approximately $60 million, largely as a result of our share of the losses in Mozarc, our co-investment with Medtronic in kidney products."", 'We expect interest expense of $100 million to $110 million per quarter in the first half of the year and $130 million to $140 million per quarter in the second half of the year. This increase is due to expiration of our 2% interest rate caps at midyear. We expect an adjusted effective income tax rate of 24% to 26%. For free cash flow, we expect $900 million to $1.15 billion, approximately 125% of adjusted net income.', 'Consistent with our long-term capital strategy, we expect to deploy the vast majority of our free cash flow toward either capital-efficient growth when such opportunities exist or otherwise return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. We anticipate ending the year within our long-term target leverage ratio range of three to three and a half times. That concludes my prepared remarks for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&A.', '', 'Operator', 'Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions] One moment please for the first question. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research, you may go ahead, sir.', 'Dean Rosales -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Hi. This is Dean Rosales on for Justin. My question is on your Medicare risk businesses. Wondering what you're seeing there in terms of trend through 2023."", ""And then specifically on special needs products, how many members do you have there exactly? And how much revenue is in those products? And could you speak to what you've seen in terms of costs year to date and then specifically Q4? Thank you very much."", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Dean. So, what I'd highlight on the risk side of Medicare Advantage is, I think it's important to realize that the ESRD population is different than the broader MA population. And some of the trends you might be seeing with other payers, which we certainly watch very carefully don't necessarily apply to our population. I'd highlight three things."", ""First, the needs of these patients and the medical costs that they bear are very different than a population given the high acuity of these patients. So, that's one. Second, I would also note the reimbursement for this population runs differently, and it's a separate reimbursement rate that comes out in both the preliminary and the final rule. And third, that the coding changes that apply to the broader MA population do not apply to the ESRD population."", ""So, with that, we're -- I think it's early for us to really have a full view on what 2023 is. That said, we're feeling pretty good about where our net savings came in, both on the SNP side and on the Medicare Advantage population within our value-based care. In terms of just some of the cleanup, we have about 3,000 members in our SNP products. And in terms of revenue, it's somewhere north of $300 million."", 'Dean Rosales -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next caller is Pito Chickering with Deutsche. You may go ahead, sir.', 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Yeah, good afternoon guys. Looking at 2024 guidance, you're assuming a loss of $50 million in IKC. Can you refresh us what that was in 2023? And then in the script, I think you talked about 25% growth in revenues of IKC and a 15% reduction of PMPM. I would have noted it shifted from a loss to gain in 2024 of those metrics."", ""So, if you can sort of help bridge that. And then I think you're shifting from a cash accounting to an accrual accounting. That seems like a pretty big shift for you guys. I guess, what's giving us comfort that that accrual makes sense at this point?"", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. So, a lot in there, Pito. Let me try and take this in the logical order. So, first, on revenue accounting.', ""What -- historically, we did not record revenue until we were comfortable that we could reasonably estimate what our share of the shared savings would be. And that was true for both our MA population and our Medicare fee-for-service population, the CKCC program. The SNP product, we've always accounted for in, I'll use your words, in an accrual method. The change we're talking about is about the change in the timing of when we get comfortable with those estimates."", ""And you asked why. It's really three things. One is we've made some changes to the contractual language that gives us earlier clarity on attributed lives. So, that's one."", ""Second, we're getting our data earlier, which obviously helps us do some of the calculations earlier. And then third, just with the experience we've had, we've got better actuarial models. And putting those three things together, we're comfortable now that we can reasonably predict our share of the shared savings revenue which ultimately turns into revenue in the plan year. So, that's on the change in the estimates."", ""In terms of you asked about 2023. So, we're guiding to a loss of $50 million for 2024. Our non-GAAP number for 2023 is a loss of $94 million. The thing to realize about that $94 million is it includes the revenue from the value-based care products from plan year '23, which is the result of this estimate change that I mentioned as well as the revenue from that product line for 2022."", ""So, I think the way to think about 2023 to make it a little bit more apples-to-apples with '24 would be to back out somewhere around $25 million, $25 million, maybe $30 million to make it a bit more apples-to-apples. And then what was your other question? There was a PMPM question in there."", 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Yeah. So, you're taking a loss of $94 million after you back out the $25 million to $30 million. I think you guided to in the script sort of growth on IKC of 25% and then a 15% reduction of PMPM in '24. So, I would assume that that growth and those reductions would have resulted in a higher in operating -- conversion operating loss."", 'So, kind of how can we sort of take those growth metrics and those cost reduction metrics and still get to a $50 million loss?', 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So, a few things. First, just to clarify that. As the change I referred to only is true of the Medicare Advantage business, the CKCC business is still new enough that we're not comfortable estimating the savings in the plan year."", ""So, that part hasn't changed. In terms of your question. So, the cost savings we're referring to is only related to our model of care in our G&A. It's not what you'd call the MLR in a health plan business."", ""It's not that equivalent for us. Second, there are some -- there was a significant amount of positive period development in 2023, in particular in the SNP business that we're not forecasting to recur. So, that would be another adjustment, which I think would help bridge the question of why aren't we getting to profitability next year or this year in '24."", 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""OK. And then on treatment growth, you're looking at the normalized growth in 4Q of 70 bps, you grew 50 bps in the third quarter. Is a key driver in fourth-quarter new patients? Is it lower mortality? And also, when you close a center, those patients to win another center, is that organic growth at the new center as old as the one as your discontinued ops, even though the patients don't actually change the numbers?"", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So, no on the last one. If patient moves from one clinic to another, it doesn't show up as any sort of growth anywhere. It's still our patient."", ""In terms of the volume growth. I would point to Q4 over Q3 as effectively being flat, treatments per day were flat. And that's really a combination of a small census decline, which is not uncommon in Q4 offset by a better treatment mix day. So, more Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, Fewer Tuesdays, Thursdays."", 'So, Q4 was really, I would call, a flat volume quarter over quarter.', 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Great. I'll jump back in. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.', 'Joanna Gajuk -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good evening. Actually, this is Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. Actually, first question is just a follow-up on the volume discussion and it sounds like flattish sequentially, but I guess year over year, up less than 1%.', ""And your guidance for '24 assumes 1% to 2% volume growth. So, kind of how do you build to that growth, especially to the higher end of 2%? What gives you confidence that, I guess, you could get to that volume growth for the year?"", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Joanna. So, I'd start with the fact that the single biggest impact on volume year over year is census. And remember that census builds over the course of the year."", ""So, if you look at the '23 growth, which was effectively flat, that was burdened by the fact that the census declined over the course of 2022 and only started building in '23. So, a lot of the zero in 2023 is the annualization of the negative impacts of 2022. As we think about '24, I'd really break it down into two components. First is new to dialysis admissions and we've watched that build over the course of 2023."", ""And we feel comfortable that that growth rate is back to pre-COVID levels. Where -- the reason we don't get back to what you'd call a 2% number pre-COVID or that would be the high end of the range is mortality continues to run higher than it did pre-COVID. It is way down off its COVID peak but it's still running a bit higher than a typical pre-COVID year, remembering that mortality moved around in pre-COVID years, primarily as a result of the severity of the flu season. So, if you take a more normal new to dialysis admit outlook and then a slightly negative mortality outlook, that's how we get to the 1% to 2%."", 'Joanna Gajuk -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Thank you for that. And another follow-up on the guidance, I guess. You talked about your outlook for revenue per treatment. So, specifically, can you talk about the build, I guess, for that? How much, I guess, is the commercial rate increases? And I guess last quarter, you mentioned there there's some larger contracts up for renewal."", ""So, any color in terms of these rate increases you're seeing there? And also, inside that, your mix, commercial versus government? And then specifically MA, where you stand on the MA mix. Thank you."", 'Joel Ackerman -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Great. Let me grab that, Joanna. A couple of things because I think underlying those questions, there's usually -- is there something unusual in the payer dynamics, and let me go ahead and start by no, we are in a normal period. And of course, we're trying to make sure that rates reflect the inflationary pressures that we are receiving."", 'To you direct question on what percent of that -- what part made out of the rate. Roughly two-thirds of the increase will be rate and one-third remaining. A good chunk of that is the annualization of the reimbursement operation improvements we saw in 2023, and the remaining is mix. As you have seen, our mix is trending on MA slightly above the market.', ""So, our MA mix finished the quarter around 52%, and we expect that number to be a couple of points higher at the end of '24. So, somewhere in the 54%, 55% range, depending on open enrollment."", 'Joanna Gajuk -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""And I guess on this commercial plan that you mentioned some larger plans up for renewal, any update there in terms of the rate increases you've seen?"", 'Joel Ackerman -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Commercial -- on the negotiations, we're not going to go into specifics. We continue to see that our commercial patients value their private insurance and commercial mix is flattish. So, nothing to report on that. And of course, that's embedded in the guidance of the RPT that we gave you."", 'Joanna Gajuk -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you so much for taking that question.', 'Joel Ackerman -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Joanna.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. A.J. Rice with UBS, you may go ahead, sir.', 'A.J. Rice -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Hi, everybody. I can't let you get through the call without asking one GLP-1 question. So, in your prepared remarks, you're saying that for the FLOW study, you anticipate efficacy on multiple endpoints, including slowing CKD for digression."", ""I think that's generally where the market is at. I wondered, given your analysis that you've offered, and seems to have really gotten traction in the financial community, are there anything -- is there anything that could come out of the FLOW study at least in the high probability range that would make you revisit? It seems like you've covered most of what you expect in your analysis, but I'm wondering is it something that makes you more optimistic, less optimistic about how this will all impact your business."", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks for the question, A.J. And as you know, last quarter, we had sort of a dissertation on GLP-1 that's gotten a lot of conversation. At the end of the day, we, of course, wanted to make sure that our shareholders and others were really well versed on it. And I think that while there could be an unusual surprise because you never want to say that the chances are zero, highly, highly improbable that we didn't capture in our range, what is likely to play out."", ""And so that is -- that at the end of the day, we expect a net neutral impact on dialysis volume over the next decade. And we did a lot of probabilistic adjustments and weighted as to how many people would participate in all the normal math that we discussed. And we don't want to change our position a bit."", 'A.J. Rice -- UBS -- Analyst', ""OK. That's great. Maybe if I could pivot and ask you about your assumptions around labor going into '24. I know there's the underlying what you're banking on for wages and benefits for your permanent workers."", ""I believe you still should have a tailwind from contract labor, at least annualizing where you're ending the year. And then there's the whole issue of the California minimum wage for low-wage healthcare workers. I know you said you wouldn't be spending for election spending, but I wonder what you're factoring in for that when you anticipate it to start to have an impact."", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. A.J., thanks for that. So, for labor for the year, we called out 2.5% to 3% of patient care cost growth per treatment. I'd break that down."", ""That's roughly half labor and half other stuff. On the labor side, we're thinking something around 5% for the year in that and California would be baked into that. We called out a few months ago, something around $30 million to $40 million as the net impact of that once it's fully rolled out in a number of 20 to 25 for 24. We've been rolling it out a little bit quicker than we anticipated."", ""So, I would expect the number will probably be somewhere in that 25 to 30 range, and that's baked into our number. The reason we're comfortable with the patient care cost being only 2.5% to 3%, given that half of it is labor, which is growing at 5% is we've got savings from the annualization of both MIRCERA -- the ship to MIRCERA as well as some of the clinic footprint actions we took. We've also got fixed cost leverage as we add volume without adding centers. And a lot of those other costs are fixed costs that don't grow with volume and are under long-term contracts."", 'So, we feel like despite a 5% wage pressure, we can get to that 2.5% to 3%.', 'A.J. Rice -- UBS -- Analyst', ""OK. That's great. Thanks a lot."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next caller is Gary Taylor with TD Cowen. You may go ahead, sir.', 'Ryan Langston -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Hi. This is Ryan Langston on for Gary. I think Dean touched on it earlier, but maybe just to go back, how is the higher sort of Medicare Advantage trend we saw in the back half of the year impacting the accruals, I guess, not only for '23 but sort of your guidance for '24? And Joel, can you remind us when you anticipate to have the final reconciliation with your plan partners? Thanks."", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So, the final reconciliation will depend. It's plan by plan. It can often take three or four quarters, and that will be -- ultimately be baked into prior period development in the IKC business."", ""In terms of the impact of some of the costs on the broader MA population in Q4. Again, we -- I think it's too early for us to say whether we think that's going to impact us. But again, I'd reiterate that our population is very different than the broader population. In terms of 2024, we're keeping a careful eye on it to see how it plays out, and it's built into our range."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next caller is Lisa Clive with Bernstein. You may go ahead.', 'Lisa Clive -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""Hi. Just two questions for me. Number one, we're 18 months since the Marietta ruling, your commercial mix and pricing seems pretty stable. So, just wanted to know if you have any thoughts on what that ruling has meant over the last few years and whether you're expecting any changes."", ""And then also just a clarification in terms of the fact that you don't need to spend on a ballot initiative and obviously, your wages are going up in California. So, seems like a reasonable truce with the SEIU. Is this something that we should expect to continue? Or is it really just this election cycle? Or it would be obviously nice for you guys to be out of this two-year cycle of fighting ballot initiatives. Thanks."", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""All right. Thank you, Lisa. So, let's start with Marietta. As we have discussed in the past, we have not seen a lot of employer groups change benefits, which is absolutely great."", ""It would be terrible for employers to not give their employees that have end-stage renal disease choice. That said, we continue to be very mindful and of course, work at the kidney community and disability groups because it is sort of a dangerous risk out there that we want to make sure has not taken advantage of. And so the analogy I say in a town hall when someone asks me if I have -- why I have so much passion on it, it's like saying the door in your house, the lock is broken. And you said, yes, but no one's broken in or very little."", ""And you say, well, you still want to fix it. And so, from our perspective, it's something that the Supreme Court said. It needed to be clarified and the champions and Congress and others believe it should be clarified. Now, we just got to work the process."", ""I also think, and we've discussed that our verification process admissions has helped in that we had an example of an employer group that actually did apply this. And when they found out that their employees didn't actually have a network, then they change their benefits again and basically reverted back to a network benefit. So, I think sometimes, people explore ideas without really understanding the full ramifications, and in that case, it worked out well. And so, we will continue to put a lot of energy on that."", ""Your second question was around the ballot. Of course, what we liked about it is that we were spending money on making sure that our patients and our teammates didn't suffer from what we call a very dangerous ballot process, but it takes a lot of money to educate the broader state on how to think about that. And so, we are extremely happy that at the end of the day, instead of spending the money on that, our teammates get the benefit of that. As it relates to, is it just this election cycle, we talked about two election cycles and that that would be a good time to hopefully iron out and revisit our relationship with labor."", 'Lisa Clive -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for the clarification.', 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Lisa.', 'Operator', 'And our next caller is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.', 'Dean Rosales -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Hi. This is Dean on again for Justin. My question is on center closings. And I'm sorry if you've touched on it already, but how much more is there to do here? And could you speak or can you parse out the impact to the P&L from the center closing, right? So revenue versus cost savings from lower fixed costs and efficiencies."", 'Thank you.', 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yes. So, I appreciate the question. We are thinking that the year will have roughly 50 centers, either closed or merged into other centers. And thinking about roughly in the ZIP code of 20 new centers, so net 30.', ""As it relates to the P&L, I'm not sure I understood your question. Could you try it again?"", 'Dean Rosales -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'More just the moving parts impact to the P&L. Just could you speak to how you guys -- one center closing.', 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', 'A good healthy way to think about it is you will have a little volume loss on patient choice. But when you strip all of that, these centers tend to be inefficient. And so, what you do is you consolidate the management and the leadership. And then you have some savings on fixed expense, in particular, rent and medical director fees.', ""And so, at the end of the day, that's where the savings come from, inefficient center with some fixed expenses that get eliminated."", 'Dean Rosales -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thank you so much.', 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Pito Chickering with Deutsche, you may go ahead, sir.', 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Hi, guys. If you could just – follow-ups here. To Joanna's question, what was the commercial mix in the quarter? And what are you seeing for 2024?"", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Commercial mix for the quarter was 10.9%, and we expect it to stay flattish.', 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""All right. Great. And then free cash flow conversion was very strong in '23 guidance is about 54% in '24. Is there anything changing within cash flow conversion? Or is this simply the DSOs that you got, what, 12 days in '23 which won't repeat in '24?"", 'Joel Ackerman -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. You've got it right. '23 was a really impressive decline in DSOs. '24, the free cash flow conversion remains well above net income, and that's really driven by two things."", ""One is just structurally our capex is lower than our depreciation and amortization. And second is share-based comp, stock-based comp. And those two things should persist, and that's why, call it, 125% of net income that we're driving in free cash flow for this year, we would expect to persist for some time."", 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'OK. Like any updates on AB 290?', 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""There is a little update. There is some activity on it. But at the end of the day, maybe the best way to summarize it is that the judge hasn't had a final ruling but gave some color. And in that color, basically, both parties won some points, and both parties lost some points."", 'And so, therefore, the odds of an appeal are quite high when there is a final ruling. And so, the next question is probably if you were to say what will be the financial impact we had guided to in the past, something in the $25 million to $40 million range. And as less people are on the AKF, I think that number is likely to be lower, more like a $0 million to $25 million would be a good range.', 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""OK. Great. And then last question, I'm going to ask the center closure question differently. What was center in liquidation at the end of -- I guess, in the fourth quarter of '23."", ""And what do you assume that goes in fourth quarter of '24?"", 'Joel Ackerman -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I'm sorry, Pito, did you say capacity utilization?"", 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Yes. I mean, just thinking about a combination of centers closing and patients coming back and there's overall center legalization. Where do you exit the year in '23? And where do you think that can get to by the end of '24?"", 'Joel Ackerman -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, we're exiting the year at about 58%. And I would expect picking up a point, maybe a little bit more over the course of the year."", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""And just as a point of reference, like if you want to go back, pre-COVID, I'm going to go back several years in the 2016 or so range, we would be in the 65-or-so percent range. And then just so you see the impact of all of this California conversation that we've had, California because how difficult the operating environment is, is roughly in the 70% range because people aren't opening centers. So, all these very expensive propositions and poor conduct have had an impact, and the people do not want to open centers there."", 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'And then just out of curiosity, if over a multiyear period to get back to 65% kind of, is this worth like 300 bps of G&A leverage here and kind of if you can size up that for me, that would be wonderful.', 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So, the leverage you'd see would be in our patient care costs, it's not in the G&A because there's a fixed cost associated with the clinic that's in the patient care cost. So, you'd see it there. I think the best I can do to help you with that math would be to think about our patient care cost per treatment number, right? So, running at $255 2023."", 'That is roughly two-thirds variable, one-third fixed. So, if you imagine us growing that volume without building as many centers, and just to be clear, we would have to build some centers because even though capacity utilization is low, the capacity may not be exactly where in the country you need it to be. So, depending on what assumption you make there, recognizing that – a third of that PCC per treatment is fixed, I think that will give you everything you need to do to do the math on what it could be worth.', 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'OK. Great. Thanks so much, guys.', 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Pito.', 'Operator', ""And at this time, I'm showing no further questions."", 'Javier Rodriguez -- Chief Executive Officer', 'OK. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for your interest in DaVita. Just in summary, we had a strong close to the year and that, combined with our guidance for 2024, we are now back on a path to recuperate our pre-pandemic financial trajectory.

403,b8e4bebf-b876-317f-9416-19b781f7bc9e,IR,2024-02-14,Here's What to Note Ahead of Ingersoll Rand's (IR) Q4 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-note-ahead-ingersoll-rands-132600136.html,1707830760,STORY,['IR'],"['Ingersoll Rand Inc. IR is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 15, after market close.The company has a stellar earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 16.1%. Its bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10% in the last reported quarter.Let’s see how things have shaped up for Ingersoll Rand this earnings season.', 'Solid demand and higher orders within the Industrial Technologies & Services segment are expected to drive Ingersoll Rand’s fourth-quarter results. Strong orders across its product portfolio of compressors, vacuum and blowers, and power tools are likely to have driven revenues for the segment.Synergistic gains from the acquisitions of Howden Roots (August 2023) and SPX FLOW’s Air Treatment business (January 2023) are expected to have boosted revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. We project the Industrial Technologies & Services segment’s quarterly revenues to increase 7.2% from the year-ago levels.Strength in the industrial businesses along with pricing actions and contributions from acquisitions is likely to have been key growth driver for the Precision & Science Technologies segment. However, weakness in the life sciences business due to continued softness in oxygen concentration and biopharma end markets might have marred segmental performance in the quarter under discussion.Nevertheless, the acquisition of Dosatron International (October 2022), which expanded its digital technology portfolio, is likely to have augmented the Precision & Science Technologies segment’s top-line growth. Also, the Westwood Technical Limited buyout (September 2022) expanded the segment’s IIoT offerings.

On the other hand, Republicans generally maintain the status quo, which involves adherence to traditions and homage to ideological heritage. Of course, the concept of election stocks is tricky because of significant overlap. For example, companies tied to physical infrastructure can do well under either a Biden or Trump administration.', 'However, because Democrats value kinesis over stasis, most Joe Biden stocks will organically incorporate forward-thinking concepts. Obviously, clean-emissions-related measures stand out. But so do enterprises that foster equity and diversity in education and advanced technical fields. Granted, companies are already moving in that direction anyways. Still, governmental tailwinds wouldn’t hurt.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Finally, let’s not forget that election stocks are also about responding to consumer behaviors. If Biden wins, roughly half the country would be unpleased. And that may yield counterintuitive results.', 'What am I talking about exactly? Read this list of Joe Biden stocks to find out!', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'Presumably, if the current president wins a second term, one of the best Joe Biden stocks to buy would likely be Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC). That’s for obvious reasons. As the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates – mainly crushed stone, sand and gravel – it will likely play a vital role in any infrastructure development policies. Call it Build Back Better, part two.', 'Of course, for Vulcan to have the best chance of upside, the Democrats need to win down ballot as well. That’s far from a given based on the contentious nature of American politics at the moment. However, Vulcan represents one of the safer election stocks because no president can afford to give up on infrastructure. If Trump wins, he will need to make America great again.', 'That has Vulcan Materials written all over it.', 'Looking ahead, analysts rate VMC a consensus strong buy with a $253.88 average price target over the next 12 months. Further, the high-side target lands at $279, implying solid, reliable growth potential.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'Should 46 get four more years, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) needs to be on your short list of Joe Biden stocks to buy. It really hits all the right notes that the administration and Democrats in general seek. Primarily, Microsoft is a technology giant and that’s exactly what the Biden-Harris administration is seeking to bolster.', 'The White House isn’t just interested in forwarding science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education but also eliminating barriers so that all students can benefit. Not surprisingly, Microsoft has stepped up big time, launching various global diversity and inclusion initiatives. As well, the company seeks to cultivate girls’ growth in STEM subjects. These are all strong left-leaning talking points, making MSFT a compelling example of election stocks to consider.', 'If that wasn’t enough, the company also laid out aggressive climate goals, such as being carbon negative by 2030. And by 2050, it will remove its historical emissions since its founding in 1975. Oh yeah – analysts love MSFT because it just keeps winning. Look for shares to hit $469.45 within the next 12 months.', 'Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.com', 'A British multinational consumer goods company, Unilever (NYSE:UL) makes for an excellent candidate for election stocks. Why? Because no matter what happens come November, people will still buy baby food, beauty products, bottled water, breakfast cereals and cleaning agents, among many other necessary products. Indeed, if Biden doesn’t pull it off, there could be a huge spike in ice cream sales as Democrats turn to coping mechanisms.', 'So, Unilever should win irrespective of the results. However, an argument could be made that UL stock could win bigger if Biden receives a second term. During the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, the company stepped forward, acknowledging systemic inequities and seeking ways to even the playing field. As well, the company has made huge strides in terms of holistic sustainability. That includes gaining approval from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).', 'Ultimately, then, 46 getting another four would\xa0 be delightful for Unilever, making it one of the Joe Biden stocks. Also, since November, the company secured two analyst buying ratings.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'As a healthcare giant best known for its insurance products, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) represents a viable example of election stocks. Bottom line, it really doesn’t matter who becomes POTUS. Healthcare is a necessity and that goes for Republicans and Democrats. Now, the political angle comes in the form of the challenges (or opportunities) a company like UnitedHealth may face depending on the November results.', 'If we’re going to talk about Joe Biden stocks, then UNH should be on your radar. Assuming that Biden wins reelection, the company could potentially benefit from various healthcare expansion initiatives and reform. For example, it could see upside opportunities with the possible expansion of Medicare or Medicaid. As well, regulatory changes may materialize that could favor managed care organizations.', 'Certainly, UNH isn’t a name that will make you rich. Over the past year, it’s only printing a modest return. However, with analysts rating shares a consensus strong buy with a $593.13 price target, it’s a good idea to have in your portfolio.', 'Source: Errant / Shutterstock.com', 'Okay, you’re going to have to bear with me here. When we discuss Joe Biden stocks, we shouldn’t just focus on the companies the president would appreciate. Instead, we should discuss enterprises that could perform well because he’s in office. If there’s any an ironic stock to be had during this election cycle, it would be Smith & Wesson Brands (NASDAQ:SWBI).', 'Let’s think about this now. If Biden were to pull off a victory and he helped down-ballot Democrats to win big, SWBI should jump higher. How come? Simple – people would rush to the gun store to pick up firearms they fear may become illegal. Plus, with the nation grappling with so much firearms-related violence, a liberal or progressive administration can’t punt the issue.', 'No, Democrats would have to come down hard on the second amendment. And that means SWBI should fly higher, contradicting its modest moderate buy target. However, it’s also one of the riskiest election stocks. If Trump wins, the subsequent conservative relief may cool firearm sales.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'Moving into the higher-risk component of Joe Biden stocks to buy, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) should be earmarked for speculation. During the final days of 2022, ENPH peaked then collapsed and then collapsed some more. Indeed, its trailing 52-week loss will raise more than a few eyebrows. And if we’re being blunt, we’re not off to a great start in 2024.', 'In fairness, Enphase will need certain elements of the economy and monetary policy to move in its favor. Specifically, the elevated inflation rate combined with onerous borrowing costs imposed devastation on Enphase’s business. As well, it impacted the underlying solar energy industry. With consumer sentiment deflated last year due to broader jitters, Enphase suffered a significant de-risking.', 'At the same time, if Biden wins, his administration will likely push various clean and renewable energy initiatives. Moreover, if the Democrats win alongside the president, that should be a huge bonus for ENPH. Analysts peg shares a consensus moderate buy with an average $127.50 price target.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'Currently, the electric vehicle market is suffering from turmoil so betting on a related enterprise might seem risky. However, if you really believe that 46 will get another crack at the White House, then Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) should be one of the Joe Biden stocks to buy. Yeah, the specialty chemicals firm has also suffered alongside the EV market. Indeed, ALB and the negative performance of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) this year are almost identical.', 'However, at some point, you got to figure that EVs will work its way out of its funk. And while integration may be more difficult in certain parts of the country, powerhouse states like California – where the weather is much more temperate – should be a boon for the sector. Plus, if Biden wins, we could see more incentivization programs to push EV adoption.', 'As well, supporting Albemarle has a geopolitical connotation in that the U.S. will be competing with China in the EV space. So, while ALB is hitting every branch of the ugly tree, a Biden reelection could turn things around. Subsequently, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $152.89 price target.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

On the other hand, Republicans generally maintain the status quo, which involves adherence to traditions and homage to ideological heritage. Of course, the concept of election stocks is tricky because of significant overlap. For example, companies tied to physical infrastructure can do well under either a Biden or Trump administration.', 'However, because Democrats value kinesis over stasis, most Joe Biden stocks will organically incorporate forward-thinking concepts. Obviously, clean-emissions-related measures stand out. But so do enterprises that foster equity and diversity in education and advanced technical fields. Granted, companies are already moving in that direction anyways. Still, governmental tailwinds wouldn’t hurt.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Finally, let’s not forget that election stocks are also about responding to consumer behaviors. If Biden wins, roughly half the country would be unpleased. And that may yield counterintuitive results.', 'What am I talking about exactly? Read this list of Joe Biden stocks to find out!', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'Presumably, if the current president wins a second term, one of the best Joe Biden stocks to buy would likely be Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC). That’s for obvious reasons. As the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates – mainly crushed stone, sand and gravel – it will likely play a vital role in any infrastructure development policies. Call it Build Back Better, part two.', 'Of course, for Vulcan to have the best chance of upside, the Democrats need to win down ballot as well. That’s far from a given based on the contentious nature of American politics at the moment. However, Vulcan represents one of the safer election stocks because no president can afford to give up on infrastructure. If Trump wins, he will need to make America great again.', 'That has Vulcan Materials written all over it.', 'Looking ahead, analysts rate VMC a consensus strong buy with a $253.88 average price target over the next 12 months. Further, the high-side target lands at $279, implying solid, reliable growth potential.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'Should 46 get four more years, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) needs to be on your short list of Joe Biden stocks to buy. It really hits all the right notes that the administration and Democrats in general seek. Primarily, Microsoft is a technology giant and that’s exactly what the Biden-Harris administration is seeking to bolster.', 'The White House isn’t just interested in forwarding science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education but also eliminating barriers so that all students can benefit. Not surprisingly, Microsoft has stepped up big time, launching various global diversity and inclusion initiatives. As well, the company seeks to cultivate girls’ growth in STEM subjects. These are all strong left-leaning talking points, making MSFT a compelling example of election stocks to consider.', 'If that wasn’t enough, the company also laid out aggressive climate goals, such as being carbon negative by 2030. And by 2050, it will remove its historical emissions since its founding in 1975. Oh yeah – analysts love MSFT because it just keeps winning. Look for shares to hit $469.45 within the next 12 months.', 'Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.com', 'A British multinational consumer goods company, Unilever (NYSE:UL) makes for an excellent candidate for election stocks. Why? Because no matter what happens come November, people will still buy baby food, beauty products, bottled water, breakfast cereals and cleaning agents, among many other necessary products. Indeed, if Biden doesn’t pull it off, there could be a huge spike in ice cream sales as Democrats turn to coping mechanisms.', 'So, Unilever should win irrespective of the results. However, an argument could be made that UL stock could win bigger if Biden receives a second term. During the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, the company stepped forward, acknowledging systemic inequities and seeking ways to even the playing field. As well, the company has made huge strides in terms of holistic sustainability. That includes gaining approval from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).', 'Ultimately, then, 46 getting another four would\xa0 be delightful for Unilever, making it one of the Joe Biden stocks. Also, since November, the company secured two analyst buying ratings.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'As a healthcare giant best known for its insurance products, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) represents a viable example of election stocks. Bottom line, it really doesn’t matter who becomes POTUS. Healthcare is a necessity and that goes for Republicans and Democrats. Now, the political angle comes in the form of the challenges (or opportunities) a company like UnitedHealth may face depending on the November results.', 'If we’re going to talk about Joe Biden stocks, then UNH should be on your radar. Assuming that Biden wins reelection, the company could potentially benefit from various healthcare expansion initiatives and reform. For example, it could see upside opportunities with the possible expansion of Medicare or Medicaid. As well, regulatory changes may materialize that could favor managed care organizations.', 'Certainly, UNH isn’t a name that will make you rich. Over the past year, it’s only printing a modest return. However, with analysts rating shares a consensus strong buy with a $593.13 price target, it’s a good idea to have in your portfolio.', 'Source: Errant / Shutterstock.com', 'Okay, you’re going to have to bear with me here. When we discuss Joe Biden stocks, we shouldn’t just focus on the companies the president would appreciate. Instead, we should discuss enterprises that could perform well because he’s in office. If there’s any an ironic stock to be had during this election cycle, it would be Smith & Wesson Brands (NASDAQ:SWBI).', 'Let’s think about this now. If Biden were to pull off a victory and he helped down-ballot Democrats to win big, SWBI should jump higher. How come? Simple – people would rush to the gun store to pick up firearms they fear may become illegal. Plus, with the nation grappling with so much firearms-related violence, a liberal or progressive administration can’t punt the issue.', 'No, Democrats would have to come down hard on the second amendment. And that means SWBI should fly higher, contradicting its modest moderate buy target. However, it’s also one of the riskiest election stocks. If Trump wins, the subsequent conservative relief may cool firearm sales.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'Moving into the higher-risk component of Joe Biden stocks to buy, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) should be earmarked for speculation. During the final days of 2022, ENPH peaked then collapsed and then collapsed some more. Indeed, its trailing 52-week loss will raise more than a few eyebrows. And if we’re being blunt, we’re not off to a great start in 2024.', 'In fairness, Enphase will need certain elements of the economy and monetary policy to move in its favor. Specifically, the elevated inflation rate combined with onerous borrowing costs imposed devastation on Enphase’s business. As well, it impacted the underlying solar energy industry. With consumer sentiment deflated last year due to broader jitters, Enphase suffered a significant de-risking.', 'At the same time, if Biden wins, his administration will likely push various clean and renewable energy initiatives. Moreover, if the Democrats win alongside the president, that should be a huge bonus for ENPH. Analysts peg shares a consensus moderate buy with an average $127.50 price target.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'Currently, the electric vehicle market is suffering from turmoil so betting on a related enterprise might seem risky. However, if you really believe that 46 will get another crack at the White House, then Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) should be one of the Joe Biden stocks to buy. Yeah, the specialty chemicals firm has also suffered alongside the EV market. Indeed, ALB and the negative performance of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) this year are almost identical.', 'However, at some point, you got to figure that EVs will work its way out of its funk. And while integration may be more difficult in certain parts of the country, powerhouse states like California – where the weather is much more temperate – should be a boon for the sector. Plus, if Biden wins, we could see more incentivization programs to push EV adoption.', 'As well, supporting Albemarle has a geopolitical connotation in that the U.S. will be competing with China in the EV space. So, while ALB is hitting every branch of the ugly tree, a Biden reelection could turn things around. Subsequently, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $152.89 price target.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price.

And if you believe that the stock is really worth $127.01, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Estée Lauder Companies’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy.

So, what have we learned so far this earnings season about the state of the consumer and any sort of trade offs we're starting to see?"", 'OLIVIA TONG: Sure. Thanks again for having me. I think a couple of things to keep in mind. Organic sales is still very strong. You see very strong sales growth across consumer staples, across beauty, particularly in the US. The consumer has been pretty resilient.', ""They've stuck to their brands and they are looking for value, but continue to look for growth, both in terms of price and mix. Volume is starting to recover off of some pretty tough comps, but we continue to be quite bullish on the sector."", ""BRAD SMITH: Where is the strongest element within this sector as of right now? As we're starting to-- and as Rochelle was mentioning, some of the reports that came through this morning really kind of giving us a sense of where these companies are continuing to push price through versus where they're just trying to make sure that they're maintaining market share."", ""OLIVIA TONG: Sure. I think quite frankly, we like the multinationals or the domestics. We went into the year thinking that. And you're seeing that play out. Colgate grew faster than P&G this quarter. Coke over Pepsi."", 'Now that said, the other area that we do like is companies that cater to either the tail end-- either tail end of the income spectrum versus in the middle. So you think about a company like e.l.f., for example, in beauty. Their average price points are in the $6 to $7 range.', ""They grew sales 85% in the quarter. So you're really seeing consumers look for value at both ends of the spectrum. Either if they're willing to pay a premium, they want some value add associated with that or a fairly low price point and, quite frankly, value associated with that as well."", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: So Olivia, in terms of your top pick in staples and discretionary here, what are the standouts and why?', 'OLIVIA TONG: Sure. We do like Colgate. We do like Procter. And we do like e.l.f., as I mentioned earlier. With respect to Colgate and Procter, we think that they will continue to grow faster than their peer set. Colgate, in particular, has a lot of international exposure, 80 plus percent international exposure.', 'So as you see disproportionate amount of pricing, Colgate will benefit from that. Whereas P&G, as sort of your steady Eddie, continue to grow price and mix. Very strong in terms of innovation and very strong gross margin and operating margin improvement.', ""And quite frankly, the gross margin has been so strong that they've been able to spend a lot of that back in terms of advertising and other brand support.

On the call today from management for our opening comments are Steven Roth, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Franco, President and Chief Financial Officer. Our senior team is also present and available for questions. I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth."", 'Steven Roth', ""Thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. We ended the year on a high note with a good fourth quarter. The quarter and the year were right on target. Although as expected, our results were negatively affected by the dramatic increase in interest rates. This will carry through next year but I expect will reverse as interest rates recede. It's important to note that our business has continued to perform well. Michael will review the quarter and the year with you in a moment. This year, our New York City office leasing team won the Gold Medal. In the fourth quarter, we leased 840,000 square feet. For the full year, we leased 2.1 million square feet. Average starting rents for the quarter and the year were record-breaking at $100 and $99 per square foot, respectively. In more gold medal stuff, for the year, we leased 1.2 million square feet at over $100 a square foot rents. The office leasing market is on the foothills of recovery but the capital markets still remain challenged and are even tightening -- and even tightening slightly as we speak. Foreclosures and givebacks are still in front of us and, therefore, so is the opportunity. As Michael and I have said on the last few calls, retail in New York City has bottomed and is recovering rapidly. While rents have a way to go to reach peak pricing of 5 years ago, we feel very good about the activity level and strength of the retail recovery. And there's more big retail news. In 2 blockbuster deals announced in December, major global luxury retailers, Prada and Kering bought prime Upper Fifth Avenue properties for their own use as stores. One deal was $835 million and the other was $963 million. So in round numbers, call it about $900 million for a half block front on Upper Fifth Avenue. So we now have the most important retailers in the world investing aggressively in real estate for their own use on the most important retail street in our country. This is only happening in the most important world cities, New York, London, Paris. Now we take this mark very personally because we own in our retail joint venture, so 52% our share, a 26% market share of available Upper Fifth Avenue in 4 blocks -- half blocks -- in 4 half blocks of similar AAA quality. I'm sure you can all do the math here. We also own in that same joint venture, the 2 best full blocks. So that would be 4 half blocks in Times Square and we have the largest sign business in town. It's been a long ride and we announced just about completed construction of our renovation of the double block-wide PENN 2 and we are about 90% complete with the surrounding plazas. The huge plazas in front of PENN 2, combined with the 33rd Street promenade and the 33rd Street setback at PENN 1 have created an enormous open public space, which I might say will be quite majestic. Directly across Seventh Avenue, the Hotel Penn is now down to the ground, creating our PENN 15 site. All this, taken together is for sure a game changer. If you are a shareholder of Vornado or are interested in Vornado, this is an immediate must go see. The world turns in funny ways and creates opportunity. The retail apocalypse is now passing, having handily survived the e-commerce attack. But now we have a CBD office apocalypse involving the work from home threat and the total blacklisting of office in the capital markets. In the end, the major cities of America will continue to grow and thrive, with New York, our hometown leading that. Office workers will gather in offices with their colleagues rather than be alone at home at their kitchen table. And in the end, the supply-demand equation will come into balance and bring on a landlords' market (inaudible) by a total cutoff of new supply. You can't build anything in these frozen capital markets and in New York, the evaporation or irrelevance of, say, 100 million square feet of old, obsolete, unrentable space. This cycle is not over yet. There remain challenges but for forward-looking investors, the time is now. My colleagues and I at Vornado are optimistic and excited. Now over to Michael."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. Though 2023 was a challenging year, our core office and retail businesses proved to be resilient. Our overall New York business same-store cash NOI was up a healthy 2.8% for the year and was up 2% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Comparable FFO as adjusted was $2.61 per share for the year, down $0.54 from 2022, largely due to increased interest expense, which is in line with the expectations that we previously communicated. Fourth quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.63 per share compared to $0.72 per share for last year's fourth quarter, a decrease of $0.09. Overall, the core business was flat and the entire decrease in the quarter was driven by increased G&A and lower FFO from sold properties. We have provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge in our earnings release and in our financial supplement. We recorded $73 million of noncash impairment charges during the fourth quarter, primarily related to joint venture assets that we intend to exit in the next few years. It should be noted that in accordance with NAREIT's FFO definition, this impairment charge is not included in FFO. Now turning to 2024. While forecasting remains challenging in the current economic environment, we expect our 2024 comparable FFO to continue to be impacted by higher interest rates and be down from 2023, which already seems to be in the market. We project a roughly $0.30 impact from higher net interest expense due to extending hedges at higher rates on our variable debt. Additionally, there will be a ding to earnings as we turn over certain spaces. Primarily at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 770 Broadway and 280 Park Avenue. This is temporary as we have already leased up a good chunk of this space but the GAAP earnings in these leases won't begin in 2024. We expect 2024 will represent the trough in our earnings and for earnings to increase meaningly from there as rates trend down and as income from the lease up of PENN and other vacancies come online.Now turning to the leasing markets. New York is clearly leading the leasing charge nationally as the city continues to experience strong employment growth. 2023 leasing in Manhattan ended on a strong note. And as we enter 2024, market conditions are more favorable than any year since the pandemic ensued in March 2020, providing support for the continued recovery in Class A office market. The economy is healthy, most employers are back in the office, at least 3 to 4 days per week. Competitive sublease space is thinning and the market for higher-end space is tightening, fueled by a decline in the new development pipeline. Now that companies have greater clarity on their space needs, tenant demand is growing, which is translating into more leasing transactions. With new supply evaporating, tenants are increasingly focused on the highest quality redeveloped Class A buildings near Penn Station and Grand Central Station, as they seek to attract and retain talent. Activity in the best buildings has been strong with vacancy at less than 10% and rents rising. Our best-in-class portfolio has been a major beneficiary of this trend, the stats bear out this, that we consistently outperform the marketplace, as Steve mentioned earlier. In 2023, we leased 2.1 million square feet and average starting rents of industry-leading $99 per square foot with 1.2 million feet at triple-digit starting rents. Importantly, we made significant strides in addressing our upcoming vacancy in tenant roll at some of our most important assets with leases with the following important customers. Citadel at 350 Park Avenue, PJT Partners and GIC at 280 Park Avenue, King & Spalding, Selendy Gay and Cushman & Wakefield at 1290 Avenue of the Americas and Shopify at 85 Tenth Avenue. Additionally, at PENN 1, we maintained strong momentum with another 300,000 square feet of deals, highlighted by new leases with Samsung and Canaccord Genuity. Just as a reminder, since we started our redevelopment efforts in the PENN District, we have leased over 2.5 million square feet of office at average starting rents of $94 per square foot, a significant increase on what these buildings achieved previously. Our fourth quarter activity led the overall market's leasing volume upturn as we completed 17 leases comprising 840,000 feet at starting rents of $100 per square foot. Even with our very strong close to 2023, our leasing pipeline heading into 2024 is robust. We currently have almost 300,000 feet of leases in negotiation with another 2 million feet in our pipeline at different stages of negotiation, including a balanced mix of new and renewal deals. Turning to the capital markets now. While the financing markets for office remain very challenging as banks continue to deal with problem loans, we are starting to see some stability with the Fed potentially cutting rates in 2024. Fixed income investors are constructive again on high-quality office and unsecured bond spreads for office have tightened significantly over the past couple of quarters. That being said, we are still away from a healthy mortgage financing market in office. And most office loans will have to be restructured or extended as they aren't refinanceable at their current levels. More broadly, lenders have no appetite for construction financing across most property types which should keep a lid on new supply. Conversely, the financing market for retail is now wide open, now that the sector has bottomed. As always, we continue to remain focused on maintaining balance sheet strength. Even in this challenging financing environment, our balance sheet remains in very good shape with strong liquidity. We are actively working with our lenders and making good progress pushing out the maturities on our loans, which mature this year. Our current liquidity is a strong $3.2 billion, including $1.3 billion of cash and restricted cash and $1.9 billion undrawn under a $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""I guess first question for Michael or maybe Glen, just kind of on that, I guess, pipeline, the 2 million square feet that you talked about, could you maybe tell us a little bit how much of that is for kind of the existing portfolio, how much of that is for the development such as PENN 2? And in that discussion, can you just talk about the upcoming expirations in '24? Are there any large known move-outs this year that you might know about that you could share with us?"", 'Glen J. Weiss', ""Steve, it's Glen. So of the pipeline that we mentioned in the opening remarks, there is a good spread in there, that's including PENN 1 and PENN 2. So activity continues to strengthen at both properties. The reception at PENN 2 has been better than excellent, tour volume is off the charts. Everyone thinks this thing is a wow, nothing they've ever seen. So the pipeline does include activity at both PENN 2 and PENN 1. As it relates to the bulge in '24 the expirations that we were facing, we've attacked it, I think, very well thus far. At 1290, we've already leased more than 50% of the space that was expiring in '24 between (inaudible) and Equitable. At 280 Park, we re-leased over 200,000 feet of the 275,000 feet expiring 24 and '25 and put away PJT, which was expiring in '26. On 770 Broadway, we continue to be in the market with -- now that building, of course, is more of a big tech, big media building but we expect that building to perform as we move along here, given its great location and great bones."", 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', 'Just a quick follow-up. Are you saying 770, does that have a Meta expiration that...?', 'Glen J. Weiss', 'It does. It is a Meta expiration of 275,000 feet in June of this year.', 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""Of what's left, the rest is Meta."", 'Glen J. Weiss', ""Yes. So, Meta, after the expiration, Steve, we'll have another 500,000 feet long term in the building."", 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""Okay. Great. And then just on the second question, I noticed that you pushed out the stabilization of PENN 2 by a year, which certainly makes sense just given the challenging market today. But you guys, also kept the -- I guess you kept the yield unchanged. So just can you kind of help us think through that? And I guess, from an accounting perspective, if leasing doesn't occur this year somewhat soon, does that begin to create a potential earnings drag in '25 just from the lack of ability to continue to capitalize costs on that project?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Steve, it's Michael. The answer with respect to stabilization is, we did push it out to '26. It's taken a little longer to get going on take-up there. But as Glen just referenced, the reaction as it's gotten to delivery here has been outstanding. So we expect that to pick up. But that being said, we're trying to be realistic as well and so we pushed it out. The yield is based on the [$759 million] odd cost, does not include carry. So that's base NOI over the original cost. So that's a simple math for you. We feel it'll drag beyond '25, if it's not done, I guess, potentially but we feel good about the pipeline and what we have baked in right now."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Griffin of Citi.', 'Michael Anderson Griffin', ""Steve, I know in your opening remarks, you talked about the stressed opportunities you're seeing out there in the market. Can you maybe quantify kind of what those opportunities could be? And when you look at kind of capital allocation priorities, would it make sense to take advantage of those, maybe relative to buying back your stock or starting new developments?"", 'Steven Roth', ""There are 3 opportunities, buying back our stock is the first one or usage of capital allocation. The second is paying off debt and deleveraging a little bit. And the third is offensively acquiring new assets. We are only interested in acquiring new assets at distressed prices. And I think as I've said, the foreclosures and the givebacks have not really -- have been at an accelerating -- accelerated pace, so the opportunities are still in front of us. I don't have any comments as to what we might do. But I think our #1 priority is the debt that we need to -- the debt expiries. And then after that, we go on the assets. The stock, we will react opportunistically to the stock price over time."", 'Michael Anderson Griffin', 'Great. And then I was wondering if you could comment on the recent news about a rent reduction from a tenant at 650 Madison. I know you only own 20% of this building but is there a worry that we should extrapolate this in terms of kind of future rent roll and maybe a sign of things to come from a leasing and rent perspective?', 'Steven Roth', ""The interesting thing is, some of the industry papers, they always get it right. But this case, they got it dead wrong. I think the facts are that the $60 number was a net number. So if you gross it up, it's about $100 a foot. Glen is telling me, it's a little less than $100 a foot but -- so it's in the low $90s, I guess."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Camille Bonnel of Bank of America.', 'Jing Xian Tan Bonnel', ""Can you talk a bit more to the retention levels of the overall portfolio in 2023? How did it track versus your expectations? And with the lack of new supply on the horizon, do you think this will pick up in '24?"", 'Glen J. Weiss', ""It's Glen. Our retention rate was strong. As I mentioned, the leasing that we've gotten done, the renewals, that thing went better than we originally had thought at the beginning of '23. And in our pipeline that we referenced, we have very good activity on forward lease expirations. We're definitely finding that CEOs, the decision makers of these tenants who are expiring forward, are now coming to us earlier than they have been over the past few years because there's less and less quality blocks of space available to them. So I would say definitively, the renewal program is stronger than it had been. We're in very good talks with many of our tenants going forward and I think it's showing in our leasing activity numbers, especially with the volume we had during '23 and what we're now seeing in '24 already."", 'Steven Roth', ""You make a good point. I think you said with the lack of supply. So the dynamics which are going to cause the office market, they get very, very healthy, pretty soon or you can't build anything in this capital market. So there will be no new supply coming on stream. The supply of buildings that were built in the last cycle over the last number of years, that space is all being eaten up. And the next trend is that tenants seem to want high-quality buildings, which are either brand new or buildings which have been completely retrofitted, which is -- and so the older buildings, and I think I said the stock of those are somewhere around 100 million to 150 million square feet. Those are just obsolete and irrelevant and will evaporate. So what we're dealing with is not a 400 million square foot marketplace, we're dealing with something which is somewhere in the high 200 million square foot, which is a totally different supply-demand equation."", 'Jing Xian Tan Bonnel', 'Appreciate the color there. And given retail seems to be a bit of a bright spot in your portfolio, can you also talk about how your leasing pipeline is looking for that side of the business?', 'Michael J. Franco', ""Sure. I appreciate you recognizing that retail is a bright spot. I think it feels like investors wrote it off and with everything that's happened in the marketplace, forgotten that we still own the most and the highest quality retail in New York City, as Steve alluded to in his opening remarks. So these are scarce property assets. I think the value is being recognized. We've talked about the last couple of quarters and it continues in our leasing pipeline. We got activity across the board, really on all the spaces. Where there's vacancy or rollover occurring, we have tenant activity, in some cases, multiple tenants for those spaces. And rents are clearly rebounding. So I would just sort of say, stay tuned. We're optimistic in terms of what's coming down the pipe based on what we're working on right now."", 'Steven Roth', 'There is definitely a finite supply of the highest quality retail space, which is what the marketplace wants. And then I hope you noticed, I have a new financial metric for retail, which is called half block price. And we got a lot of half blocks in the best place.', 'Jing Xian Tan Bonnel', ""I appreciate that. And just finally, on the G&A side, you've managed to control those costs quite well since the pandemic but it did pick up last year due to some additional stock expense. Is this a reoccurring event going forward? And are there any key considerations for '24 that will keep your G&A at the current or higher levels? Just for instance, less capitalized interest from your development program now that PENN 1 is out of the pool."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""No, capitalized interest will be comparable. G&A, some of that will roll off given that was a onetime event. But I think what you're referencing generally is the compensation plans put in place which we felt important to retain our talent in a difficult environment. And so we implemented those, 1 in June, heavily tied to -- entirely tied to stock performance over the next 3, 4 years. And if the shareholders do quite well, then the employees will do quite well. So that expense was elevated in '23. And that will start to, I think, normalize as we get into this year."", 'Steven Roth', 'Tom, how many years are we writing off the expense for the comp plan?', 'Thomas Sanelli', ""So it's 4 years (inaudible) accelerated."", 'Steven Roth', 'So, say it again...', 'Thomas Sanelli', '(inaudible) accelerated.', 'Steven Roth', ""So the expense we're writing off the equity comp plan that we issued in June is over a 4-year period. So the G&A will benefit enormously shortly as that rolls off. And I think I said in my remarks, you climb the mountain and then you go to the other side of the mountain. So the rise in interest rates had penalized our earnings, actually pretty substantially. That is going to reverse somewhere as the government begins to reduce rates, which they will. And then similarly, well, I guess that's the big -- but those are the 2 -- that's the big thing. Now similarly, Michael said that our earnings were going to be hit or dinged, I think, was his word, by turnover independent from the (inaudible) and expiry -- lease expiry of that. Once again, those spaces will fill up, income will come on board. So these are temporary reductions in our earnings which will absolutely reverse."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from John Kim of BMO.', 'John P. Kim', ""Given all your commentary on street retail and how it's recovered, the pricing has been very strong. Are you going to be looking to sell into this strength? Or do you think market rents are going to improve? Or is this really just telling us to update our -- and the estimates?"", 'Steven Roth', ""Hi, John. Well, the first thing is we're enjoying the bounce back from the retail. I mean, retail had a target on its back threatened by e-commerce, et cetera. And that has all evaporated and now retail has become the vogue. We believe that the asset prices of the assets that we own has increased dramatically from the bottom. And we may take advantage of those prices by selling assets from year-to-year, from here every once in a while. We've already sold a chunk of assets that we really thought were not part of our core. So we've sold some, we may well sell some more and we're absolutely convinced that rents are going to rise. Will they rise to the peak pricing that they were 5 years ago? Probably not but they're certainly going to rise from here."", 'John P. Kim', ""Okay. Do you think you'll get the same pricing you got originally when you established that joint venture? In other words, have its pricing and assets reached peak level from...?"", 'Steven Roth', ""We're delighted with the pricing that we were able to achieve in our last joint venture. We're not going to speculate on what the pricing will be."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""John, it's -- that's speculation. I think if you look at the pricing that Prada and Kering paid and Steve talked about the half blocks. And you analyze what our portfolio could be worth, then it's not a stretch to say that we're back at those levels or will get back to those levels, right? Now -- and who knows over time. But I think what you're seeing is, I think the most important thing is, you have 2 of the most important retailers in the world who are saying Fifth Avenue is critically important to us. We want to be there forever. We are prepared to pay a meaningful price to be there. And I think the history of these things is, the animal spirits get going. You don't think that other retailers are behind them saying, maybe we need to make sure we have a place on Fifth and secure our position. So I don't think it's a stretch to think that these aren't the last 2 transactions that occur on Fifth."", 'John P. Kim', ""And Michael, you mentioned an impairment that you've taken this quarter related to joint venture assets you're looking to exit. Is it this retail joint venture that you're discussing? Are there other assets? And if so, which ones are they?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Yes, not the retail. Retail, the worst is past us, as we've said. Now these were just a handful of smaller -- generally, they're really all office assets, they're in joint venture. The accounting treatment, as you guys should know well by now, given the Street retail events, the accounting treatment, the impairment methodology is much different from joint ventures than for wholly owned assets. And this is a handful of assets that we intend to exit over the next 2 to 3 years and that results in a different accounting approach and thus the impairment. It's an accounting convention, what the ultimate proceeds will be realized, TBD. But again, it relates to a handful of smaller assets."", 'Steven Roth', ""But there is no doubt that in this cycle, values have fallen. So when interest rates go from 3.5% to 8% that has an enormous effect on value. And so therefore, I'm very pleased that the impairments were as small as they were actually."", 'John P. Kim', 'And just to confirm, this does not include 1290 or 555 Cal?', 'Michael J. Franco', 'No.', 'Steven Roth', ""That's correct."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Dylan Burzinski of Green Street.', 'Dylan Robert Burzinski', 'Okay. Just 2 quick ones on occupancy for both the office and retail side of things. So it sounds like for New York office, that occupancy should bottom throughout 2024. And as you guys have started -- already leased up some of the move-outs that -- it should see a pretty swift recovery as we look out into 2025 and beyond? Is that sort of a fair characterization?', 'Glen J. Weiss', ""It's Glen. I think that's fair. I think you'll see it dip over the coming quarters based on what we talked about earlier. And based on the pipeline, we'll come right back up. I think it's fair what you characterize it. Yes."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Probably flattish for '24 though overall."", 'Steven Roth', ""Just a word there on -- hang on, hang on, just a word about occupancy. So the market occupancy is in the high teens. So our occupancy is, give or take, around 90% (inaudible) south of 90%. If you look back over our history, our normal occupancy is a hair over 95%, 96%, they call it 96%. The difference between 96% and 100% is kind of like structural vacancy, you never get to 100% on a large over 20 million square foot portfolio. So our occupancy is really the difference between -- our vacancy is really the difference between 96% and 90%, let's say 6%, which we think is -- we can do better, we will do better but we think that's pretty good performance in a soft market. Now the next thing is that when we ramped up the space, as the markets revert to normal, from 90% to 96%, that's a very significant increase in our earnings. So we have that in front of us for sure."", 'Dylan Robert Burzinski', 'Great. And I think that kind of sort of leads into my next question, is on the retail side of things. As we look at the portfolio today, I think in your disclosure, you guys say, occupancy is high 70s, pre-COVID you were mid-90s. I guess just, how do we think about the recovery there given some of the comments that you guys laid out regarding the leasing pipeline?', 'Steven Roth', ""Well, the retail occupancy is really sort of an anomaly. It includes the Manhattan Mall, JCPenney (inaudible), who vacated made a couple of years ago. And that's 11 points of occupancy. Is that right? And what's the next -- what's the second one, Tom?"", 'Thomas Sanelli', 'We have Farley, the retail there.', 'Steven Roth', ""And then Farley, we have (inaudible) on the Ninth Avenue side, so between those 2, we're somewhere in the probably mid-80s."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Mizuho.', 'Vikram L. Malhotra', ""Just, I want to just go back to your comment about FFO troughing in '24. So just 2 clarifications to what you've said first was the Facebook lease, 770, is it -- was it clear that the 200,000 or so square foot expiring, they're going move out but then the rest is there long term, #1. And #2, could we just roughly quantify the move-outs you mentioned, what is the FFO impact this year to that?"", 'Glen J. Weiss', ""On the first question, the remaining Meta 500,000 feet is long term. That's correct."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Right. So the -- yes, so the 270,000 feet is just one component this year. And the remainder, Vikram -- but we don't give guidance, right? There's a number of ins and outs. Yes, you can just quantify the specific 3 situations we mentioned but there's other things that are going on as well. So I don't want to isolate and say, on these 3, this is the impact because that doesn't give the full picture. Net-net, we expect it to be negative. How big? We have to see what transpires across the whole portfolio."", 'Vikram L. Malhotra', ""And so I guess just a second question is to clarify. You're basically saying with the move outs, with the interest rate impact, et cetera, the ins and outs, you think FFO will go -- occupancy will dip. You're assuming the least rate will eventually come back, is what I'm assuming you're referring to. And then the impact of all that leasing will help '25 recover FFO wise. Is that fair? Is there any other big moving piece to that equation?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""No, I think that's fair. Obviously, look, as we leased up Penn, which is -- which and some of the other vacancy that Steve mentioned that's not just natural turnover, it's going to power that as well. But I think your general comment is accurate."", 'Steven Roth', ""I agree it's accurate. So to summarize. Interest rates have gone up and have been painful. They will go down. They're not going to go down all the way to 0 but they will go down. And so that's going to increase our earnings from here. Our occupancy is going to climb from, say, 90% to whatever. And so that's going to increase our earnings. And then the big thing is, over the next 2 years, 2 PENN will rent, the income from that will come online. Now that's probably over $100 million. So these are fairly substantial numbers. But -- so overall, you're 100% correct."", 'Vikram L. Malhotra', ""Okay. Great. And then, Steve, just last one. You mentioned external growth opportunities at some point, obviously paying -- delevering. I'm assuming FFO growth is important. But -- so if you look to maybe as the Board and yourself, you look -- we look to award executives LTIPs going forward, what are maybe 1 or 2 of the top metrics that could be different the next 5 years versus the last 5 years in terms of gauging those LTIP awards."", 'Steven Roth', ""I don't know how to answer that. We don't give guidance for next quarter and it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen over the next 5 years. But a couple of -- to talk around that very sophisticated question, Vikram. We are a New York-centric company. I don't imagine that we will open up a new beachhead where we don't have the same kind of depth of experience, knowledge and franchise that we have. So basically, we're a New York company, my guess is, is that unless something but I'm not contemplating comes up, we will stay a New York company. Now we opened up a beachhead in Washington some years ago, spun that off into a separate company, which I think is a terrific opportunity. And then we had a large Northeastern shopping center company, which we also spun off. So we have experience with different geographies. But my guess is that the main company will continue to be New York-centric. The likelihood is, we will continue to be a large aggressive office company. But I think I've said this before, we will not make acquisitions of conventional office at full pricing. We will only be a buyer at -- I don't want to call it distress, what's the right word, Michael? Okay, at distressed prices for office buildings. And we will only buy the finest office buildings.We have some residential. I'd like to do a little bit more of that. And then what we will develop in the PENN District is an extraordinarily important part of our company and maybe arguably the most important development in the country as we go forward. But you can't build anything in PENN District today because of the frozen capital markets. You cannot do it. The math doesn't work. But as that begins to thaw, we will consider residential -- building and developing residential in that marketplace. And we might even sell a piece of land through a residential developer. So we can't predict what's going ahead to happen. But in 5 years, we will be New York-centric. We will be majority an office company and the PENN District will be really important 5 years from now."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.', 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Steve, just talking about the comp plan that you guys put in place around 350 Park at the year-end. Obviously, in the middle of last year, the stocks were on their back and you guys revised your comp plan, understandably just given how the stock was depressed and I think we all understood that. At the end of the year, though, the 350 comp plan definitely surprised and especially that shareholders have to wait till the end of this year to figure out their dividend for 2024, the stub -- the (inaudible) stub aside. So can you just walk through how we should think about that comp plan for a development project that doesn't deliver for another decade while you're talking about earnings still going down this year and shareholders having to wait another year for the dividend. Just want to understand that, especially in light of the midyear update that you guys did for the senior executives and upper generation last summer."", 'Steven Roth', ""Sure. Alex, the -- let me go backwards first. Your comment about the dividend. We have had an enormous number of incomings from shareholders, analysts, et cetera and industry peers, saying what we did with the dividend was correct. And to continue to pay, by the way, we will rightsize the dividend but to continue to pay and overpay a dividend, et cetera, in this capital markets is just not the most efficient use of capital. So you seem to be on the other side of that. I can tell you that most of your friends and peers are -- think that what we did was the correct thing. Pardon me. Now let's talk about the development fee comp plan. So this is something that we've been thinking about a long time. So the first thing is, its objective is retention, reward, to increase motivation and to incent our most important employees. Retention, reward, motivation and incent.So the first thing is that anything that is paying out on that comp plan comes from joint venture development projects. Now we don't do a lot of those. 350 Park is probably in my memory, the first one. We did -- we did 220, 100%. So we don't do a lot -- and we own the PENN District is 100%. So this doesn't come into being until there is a joint venture partner that pays a development fee. Now I talked about incentives and motivation. We think that it's, shoulder to shoulder with our shareholders that we do this kind of investing. And we think it's also shoulder to shoulder with our shareholders that we bring in outside third-party capital, the funds, which has become -- most of our peers in the industry are using outside capital. We haven't done that in the past. So we want to do that in the future. So that's the beginning of it. By the way, it's a very small plan. We don't expect it to be substantial in any way. And as we look at it and as we review our senior management compensation and even down the line, we find that our compensation is lower than almost all of our peers. So this is a way to have performance-based comp, a small amount of -- a small amount, by the way. And this is other than stock-based comp because we can't control the stock price. But we can control our performance in joint ventures. It's only payable out of third-party development fees, not development fees that Vornado would be paying. And we think it's highly appropriate. We probably made a mistake. We did a good job of socializing the June comp plan. We sort of didn't do it with this development comp plan because we thought it was very small. We thought shareholders would get it. And frankly, I made a mistake. We should have told our shareholder base what we were going to do. I myself have -- hang on, I myself, I'm extremely unhappy to get any negative comments about that. And -- but there it is. We think it's right. We think it's a good way of comping our people. We don't -- I think our people are underpaid, certainly at the highest level and at the highest level. And by the way, doing a 2 million square foot building in New York City is backbreaking work. It's nights, it's weekends, it's backbreaking work. And we think that the team deserves it."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Steve but to that point, if it's a small amount, it would seem like something that's just part of the annual comp committee, like, hey, you, guys, did a great job, as part of your bonus for your 2023 or 2024, we're rewarding. So if it's a small number, it doesn't seem like that much of an incremental incentive. And two, it just seems like ordinary course that management is expected to do to drive value for shareholders and would be part of their regular course compensation. It's not clear why it would be a stand-alone."", 'Steven Roth', ""Obviously, I don't want to agree with you. But this is -- I would like to agree with you. I would like you to agree with me but I'd like you to agree with me, rather than me agree with you. But anyway, the -- no compensation plan is paid unless it goes through the comp committee of the Board and they take all circumstances into account. So there you have it."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', 'Okay. Let me switch. Glen, on PENN 2, I believe you guys switched brokers from your original one to a new one. Just curious, the progress that you guys had on PENN 1 seemed pretty good. You toured us last year of the project, it certainly seemed to impress what you guys have done with PENN 1. It seemed like leasing was going well. What happened with PENN 2 that you found it necessary to switch brokers and is that sort of a repositioning of the asset, different tenants? Or was there something else that you learned through the process that caused you to switch brokers on PENN 2?', 'Glen J. Weiss', ""So we did not switch brokers. The Cushman & Wakefield team is additive to my team. Something we do not do often, as you know but here we decided to do it to cover the entire market, both regionally, locally and nationally. We brought in a great team. The team had just done all leasing over in Manhattan West, so it's additive, not a switch. PENN 1 remains the Vornado team and that was the reasoning for doing the PENN 2, add Cushman & Wakefield but no switch, no change, normal course of business."", 'Steven Roth', ""Alex, I'm confident that the gold medal team of Glen and the rest of his team in-house has the strength and the ability, the franchise to do the job. But we're in the no stone unturned business. And so we thought that adding Cushman to have that extra look into the marketplace was a good piece of insurance and it's working out."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs.', 'Julien Blouin', ""This is Julien Blouin on for Caitlin. Steve, regarding the dividend and adding to Alex's question, last quarter, you provided a really helpful breakdown of your 2023 expected taxable income. I was wondering if you could provide the same for 2024. And should we assume that the fourth quarter dividend will be again at sort of the minimum required taxable income level?"", 'Steven Roth', ""The answer to that is that we have a broad idea of what the 2024 taxable income will be, as you would expect. But it is not a number that we are comfortable enough with disclosing publicly. So that's the first one. The second point is, at this time, it's a financial policy of our Board to pay out the minimum dividend because from a capital allocation point of view, that's the right decision. We have had, as I said before, numerous investors, shareholders, analysts, peers tell us that's the right decision. The dividend, the most interesting part of the dividend, however, will likely be gains on asset sales because all of our assets have very low basis. So if we choose to sell an asset or 2 or 3 or 4, in '24, that will determine more than anything, what the dividend would be."", 'Julien Blouin', ""That's really helpful. And then maybe switching gears. To PENN 1, the ground lease renewal. I think you mentioned at the beginning of last year, that you thought the final number could come in lower than the original $26 million estimate just based on evolving sort of market conditions. Is that still your expectation? And I guess what is the latest update on that process?"", 'Steven Roth', ""Well, that's absolutely my expectation but there's somebody on the other side that disagrees with that. So we're in the middle of the process -- the arbitration process to determine what the number will be. And that's something we can't speculate on."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.', 'Nicholas Philip Yulico', ""Just first, a question on PENN 1, based on the incremental yield you gave last quarter in the sup, I know it's now in the, I guess, more stabilized pool. But it looks like there was eventually $59 million of future NOI, I assume they're on a cash basis. Can you just let us know like how -- any of that's already been captured yet and just how to think about the impact of any of that, if there's any of that benefit assumed for this year?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Nick, it's Michael. I can't give you the exact numbers off hand. The answer is some of that is back in '24 but this is a rolling program and so it will continue to come in next year as well. Obviously, there's vacancy there. As that gets leased up, that will come online as well. So the answer is some of that's there. I can tell you is and it's not in the development yields anymore. This project is done. But our -- the last one we had published, we're confident in terms of hitting that and hopefully exceeding it. But we can sort of circle up and get to more specifics. But some of that's in '24 but it will roll in over the next 1 year or 2 years as well."", 'Steven Roth', ""I'd like to make a couple of comments. The first is that all of us focus on what the initial yield is on an asset. I think it's a very interesting exercise to say what can that asset produce in terms of revenue 3, 5, 7 years out. So we believe, for example, in the PENN District, we believe in the west side of Manhattan. We believe that when you combine PENN District with Manhattan West and Hudson Yards, I mean that's a hell of a neighborhood, highly sought after and whatever. So we believe that these assets will return a very satisfactory return at the get-go and will grow from there as we continue to own them over the next period of time. So there's that. We also believe that -- I mean there's some question about which is more important, Penn or Grand Central? Well, the answer is obviously, Grand Central is at the foot of Park Avenue. So that's very important. And I think everybody considers Park Avenue to be the principal business boulevard in the country, maybe even in the world. We have a representation of multiple assets on Park Avenue too. But it's interesting to note that New Jersey Transit comes into only Penn Station. And New Jersey is the fastest growing suburb of New York. So we are very, very happy with our position."", 'Nicholas Philip Yulico', ""Okay. Just second question is on PENN 1 and PENN 2. You, guys, give only the occupancy numbers in South. And I'm just wondering if there's any way that you can give us a feel for like a leased rate for those assets or even think about how much of the leasing you've achieved so far of what your ultimate plan is on getting to these stabilized cash yields you talk about for the projects."", 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""So much you're going to do -- how much PENN 1 (inaudible)"", 'Glen J. Weiss', ""I mean, as Michael said, PENN 1 is a multiyear program. When we set out on the project, there were over 200 tenants in the property, which we're rolling over the next, call it, 5, 6, 7 years. We've leased a considerable amount of space in PENN 1 to date and we continue to cycle through as these tenants expire year-to-year. And it's been very successful. We've leased over (inaudible) feet this year, it rents north of 90% and we have a lot of action in the pipeline now. Similarly, at PENN 2, we talked about the pipeline. We have deals coming to fore at PENN 2 as we speak. And you could stay tuned on that activity as we roll into the first, second quarter of '24."", 'Nicholas Philip Yulico', ""Okay. Yes. And I appreciate all the commentary on the re-leasing. It's just honestly a little bit hard to understand where you guys are at in terms of the re-leasing of those projects? And at what point you're getting the NOI benefit because there's no like bridge provided anymore about the rolling out and the rolling in of NOI. So it's honestly very difficult to quantify what the benefit to the company is going to be over the next couple of years."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""I would say, Nick, let's go through it, right? PENN 2, we've got [$1.4 million] to lease up, okay? PENN 1, we've probably taken care of. I'm going to rough guess about half the square footage to date, right? So there's probably another 1 million to go in terms of rolling that up to market -- that to market, right? Between those 2 assets, in a short period of time and let's call it -- let's use the asset, 3 years, right? There's going to be an incremental $200 million that comes from -- in NOI that comes from those assets, maybe a little less from Farley too, in terms of remaining retail. But the bulk of that is PENN 1, PENN 2. That's probably a net of capitalized interest, another $150 million, right? So that's as crisp as I can give it to you, whether I'm a little bit early or a bit late on the timing, that's the magnitude and it's going to happen."", 'Nicholas Philip Yulico', 'Great. I appreciate that extra commentary, Michael.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan.', 'Anthony Paolone', 'I just have one. Michael, if I got your comment right earlier, I think you mentioned debt markets are pretty open right now for retail. And so I was wondering if that creates any opportunities for you all to get paid back on your [prep] interest in the JV in the near term at all.', 'Michael J. Franco', ""Tony, the -- we're pleased that the markets are opening. And the answer is, we're starting to look at it. But -- we've got some leasing to do on a couple of those assets as well, right? If you think about a 689 or Fifth or the old space at 1540. So there's a little bit of leasing as we had accomplished, stabilized 2 or 3 of the assets. But as opposed to something that was sort of not on the table as a possibility, I think it's emerging as a possibility. And as the markets continue to improve, the answer is, we are absolutely focused on it. And we're sort of gathering data and looking at it. But it's one of those things where we got to do leasing. There's also a size limitation in terms of how much you can put through the system. But our goal is to repatriate that capital over time when that -- when the opportunity is emerging."", 'Steven Roth', ""I look at it differently. The markets are open, which really means that lenders are prepared to give you money at 8%. That's not open to me because the cost of that capital is just too high. And it will -- this is not the time to be aggressively borrowing unless you absolutely need it. So the answer is, we look at it from an academic point of view but it would be very surprising to see our company aggressively refinance the preferred or anything else at these interest rates. Now just a minute about our liquidity. We have a big amount in cash. We consider at some point in time that the preferred is a source of liquidity. Not at 8% but lower. But if we had to, it's a source of liquidity and that's $1.8 billion. And the next is, remember that Penn Plaza has no debt on it. So we've got PENN 1 debt-free, PENN 2 debt-free, Farley debt-free and Hotel Penn site debt-free. So we have an enormous source of liquidity which we think is pretty interesting."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.', 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Great. Just one for me as well. I was just looking at the 10-K, in the footnote you put some really helpful details about where you expect to release some of the maturities on the office portfolio. I think it looks like flat or in some of the retail at sort of over 30%, which I thought was helpful. But trying to connect the dots between those re-leasing spreads. I think we talked earlier on the call about occupancy potentially dipping in the first -- back part of the year before picking up, can you put that all together for us and into a same-store NOI number? I know you don't give guidance but is there some broad strokes that we should be thinking about same-store NOI? Is it flat? Is it slightly down? How should we think about those pieces?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""It's probably a little bit down in the aggregate. But again, it depends a little bit on what basis and when happens. So hard to give you any more guidance than that. But I think your overall characterization in the office on an average basis, flat is probably accurate. But as Glen and his team has a history of doing -- we'll pull forward a number of leases that are going to roll and deal with those. So it's sort of hard to give you that number."", 'Operator', 'The next question is a follow-up from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""Just 2 quick follow-ups. Michael, I think on the G&A, you and Steve had provided some color. But I just wanted to -- so are you saying that in '24, you think that G&A will be flattish with '23 or it actually comes down in '24 versus '23?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Well, it's going to come down. The developments we're done are not going to be there, right? I mean that was a last year item, that's not going to reoccur, this item, so that's going down. So the answer is yes, we think it will be down."", 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""Okay. But just basically stripping that out, that's really the only kind of one-timer that would sort of come off the '23 number?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Yes. There's a little more in terms of things that were accelerated that aren't going to reoccur just based on historical vesting for certain people. But -- so the answer is, net-net, between development fee that -- I don't know, is Tom, we're talking $10 million or so, that neighborhood, probably somewhere in the neighborhood that comes off, of course, in '24."", 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""Okay. Great. And then just second follow-up, just on -- I think you've got a big refinancing that you're working on with your partner at 280 Park Avenue. Just any kind of color, I think, that might have gone into special servicing. I assume that, that was maybe part of the mechanics of getting that loan refinanced. But just any color or commentary you could provide on that refinancing would be great."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Sure. I'm not going to say too much given we're still in the middle of the process but it is a CMBS loan, going into special servicing, is part of the process of working that out. And we and our partner are making good progress on that and we expect to get to a successful resolution with terms that we think are attractive. So more to come shortly there. But we've been hard at work for the last 6, 9 months. The CMBS loans are painful, complicated, given the way they're set up. But you have the right sponsorship and I think they recognize that. So we're getting closer to the finish line."", 'Operator', ""That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steven Roth for any closing remarks."", 'Steven Roth', ""Thank you, everybody. We appreciate your interest in our company. We learn from you every call. This was an interesting call. And we -- it's snowing -- and we'll see you at the next call. When is the next call?"", 'Unidentified Company Representative', 'May 7.', 'Steven Roth', 'On May 7. Have a good day.', 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.""]"

Dan?"", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""Thanks, Humphrey, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I will discuss key milestones and highlights from the fourth quarter and full year 2023 as we continue to execute our strategy with discipline and focus and deliver strong results for our customers and shareholders.Deanna will follow with additional details of our results, the investment portfolio, our capital position as well as our 2024 outlook. 2023 was a great year for Principal. We delivered on our ambitious outlook for the enterprise despite a wide range of macro issues, including significant geopolitical events and global inflation. These factors resulted in elevated market and interest rate volatility, which impacted investor risk appetite and increased allocations to cash and cash equivalents.Our diversified and integrated business model continued to prove resilient despite these challenges and generated robust fourth quarter and full year results.Starting on Slide 3, we reported $1.6 billion of full year 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings or $6.55 per diluted share. Excluding significant variances, earnings per share increased 6% over 2022 at the top end of our 2023 outlook. Our strong capital position and full year free capital flow enabled us to deliver on our capital deployment strategy.We invested for growth in our businesses and returned more than $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchase and common stock dividends, nearly 90% of net income, excluding exited businesses.As shown on Slide 4, we reported $441 million of non-GAAP operating earnings or $1.83 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. We ended 2023 with $695 billion of total company managed AUM, up over 9% from 2022. While markets were volatile throughout the year, they finished the year strong, market performance and foreign currency tailwinds more than offset outflows on a full year basis.Adjusting for the large withdrawal as we discussed last quarter, we generated a positive $350 million of PGI institutional net cash flow in the fourth quarter, driven by real estate and fixed income flows. Retail net cash flow for us and the asset management industry remains challenged as approximately $6 trillion of assets remain in money market funds or cash equivalents.We continue to benefit from diversification of distribution channels among institutional, retail, retirement, private assets and international geographies. Our organic growth rate measured by net cash flow as a percentage of beginning-of-period assets has proven more resilient than our active management peers over the last 12 months.As interest rates retreat from their peak, we were well positioned with the right strategies as investors begin to reallocate back into risk-based assets. The pipeline of committed yet unfunded real estate mandates remain strong, currently over $6 billion that will put to work opportunistically.We continue to grow our in-house capabilities, including Principal Alternative Credit, our direct lending franchise that recently surpassed $2 billion in borrower commitments since we launched in 2020. We have generated an 11% IRR since inception and the current portfolio yield is 13%, making this a compelling offering for our clients. This is yet another testament of our dedication to providing differentiated investment capabilities to clients across all asset classes.Turning to Slide 6. Investment performance improved significantly across Morningstar rated funds and composites, particularly in our retirement focused asset allocation strategies. While there have been some quarterly fluctuations, we are focused on generating consistently strong long-term performance for our clients.In Principal International, we ended the quarter with a record $180 billion of total reported AUM. The increase was driven by a combination of market performance, foreign exchange tailwinds and over $2 billion of positive cash flows through 2023, evenly split between Latin America and Asia. While the Asia economy continues to face headwinds, we are still confident about the region's long-term potential.We welcomed a new President of Latin America in November, Pablo Sprenger. Pablo joins Principal with more than 20 years of industry experience, most recently as CEO of SURA Investments. His deep knowledge of our markets and the customer segments we serve will be valuable in driving growth across the region.Turning to U.S. retirement. We generated strong growth in revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter. Our focus on revenue generation and continued expense discipline helped drive the full year margin above the top end of our guidance range, while we continue to invest for future growth.Business fundamentals remain very healthy. We generated a strong growth in transfer deposits over the fourth quarter of 2022, including a 9% increase in fee-based and 36% increase in spread-based transfer deposits. These strong results were driven by growth in the retirement plan sales as well as robust pension risk transfer sales, which exceeded targeted returns.Total RIS reoccurring deposits increased 12% over the year ago quarter, including a 14% increase in the SMB segment. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in participant deferrals and employer matches and retirement plans. While we are pleased to see planned lapses moderate in the fourth quarter, which is typically an active quarter for planned transitions and lineup changes, participant withdrawals increased over the year ago quarter.All in, we saw a significant improvement in account value net cash flow compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, RIS sales increased 9% over 2022, driven by a 17% increase in fee-based transfer deposits and nearly $3 billion of pension risk transfer sales.We continue to leverage our favorable market position with a full suite of retirement and workplace solutions and like the good momentum we're seeing in our retirement platforms heading into 2024, and Specialty Benefits of record full year sales as well as strong retention, employment and wage growth contributed to a 9% growth in premium and fees over both the fourth quarter of 2022 and full year.Attractive segments within the SMB market remain underpenetrated, and we are confident in our ability to serve these customers with a meaningful value proposition. Sales and specialty benefits so far this year are tracking to our expectations, and importantly, retention is also strong. These factors give us confidence we will continue to grow faster than the market in 2024.In Life, premium and fees for the total block increased 5% over the fourth quarter of 2022, including a 26% increase in the business market segment. Our focus on the business market is resonating with distribution partners and has more than offset the runoff in our legacy retail block.I'm excited about the growth opportunities across Principal and remain confident that our focus on higher-growth markets, combined with our integrated product portfolio and important distribution partnerships will continue to create value for customers and shareholders.At our core, we remain committed to providing individuals, businesses, communities and markets access to essential financial tools, products and guidance, and we see strong demand for our brand of expertise and support in today's environment.Before turning it over to Deanna, I'd like to highlight an important recognition we received this quarter, included on Slide 5, along with other 2023 awards in recognition. For the 12th consecutive year, Principal Asset Management was once again named a Best Place to Work in Money Management by Pensions & Investments, earning this recognition every year since the inception of the award. Recognition like this helps us benchmark progress, attract and retain talent and stand out in the marketplace.I'd be remiss if I didn't also take a moment to recognize Pat Halter, President of Principal Asset Management, who announced his retirement after 40 years with the company. I will miss Pat as a business leader and also as a very trusted adviser. I wish he and his family much success in the next phase of their life. He has guided Principal Asset Management through significant growth, including further diversification of its active specialty investment capabilities into private markets and new geographies.I'd also like to congratulate Kamal Bhatia, who has assumed the role as President of Principal Asset Management. Kamal joined the company in 2019 as an industry veteran with significant experience in investment solutions, business strategy, client engagement and product development.We closed 2023 with momentum across our diverse portfolio of businesses. Our success is a testament to the focus and hard work of our nearly 20,000 dedicated global employees, their ongoing commitment to excellence and to our customers enable us to seize opportunities and set the stage for future growth. Deanna?"", 'Deanna Dawnette Strable-Soethout', ""Thanks, Dan. Good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I'll share the key contributors to our financial performance for the quarter and full year updates on our investment portfolio, our current capital position as well as details of our outlook for 2024.Full year reported net income was $623 million. Excluding exited business, net income was $1.5 billion for the full year with credit losses of $81 million. Fourth quarter net income, excluding exited business, was $299 million, with $27 million of credit losses. As a reminder, the income from exited business is noneconomic and is driven by the change in the fair value of the funds withheld embedded derivatives. It doesn't impact our capital or free cash flow and can be extremely volatile quarter-to-quarter. Full year credit drift and losses were modest and better than our expectations at the beginning of the year.Excluding significant variances, full year non-GAAP operating earnings was $1.7 billion or $6.92 per diluted share. This was a 6% increase in EPS over 2022 at the top end of our 3% to 6% outlook and included $436 million in the fourth quarter or $1.81 per diluted share. As detailed on Slide 24, significant variances impacted fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings by a net positive $5 million on both a pretax and after-tax basis and $0.02 per diluted share.The significant variances included strong encaje performance, largely offset by lower variable investment income. Looking at macroeconomics in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 daily average was slightly higher than the third quarter of 2023, and 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. While the S&P 500 Index increased 24% from the end of '22, the daily average increased just 4% from the 2022 daily average. In addition, the S&P 500 performed better than mid-cap, small cap and international equities as well as fixed income and alternatives.Relative to our 2023 outlook, the daily average increase was lower than our typical 6% price appreciation assumption, but it was higher than expected heading into the year. Foreign exchange rates were a headwind relative to the third quarter, but a tailwind compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and on a trailing 12-month basis.Margins across the enterprise remain strong as we took actions to reduce expenses to align with revenue while investing for growth and increasing scalability.On a full year basis, compensation and other expenses increased modestly over 2022 despite elevated severance expense of $20 million in the fourth quarter and $30 million for the full year.Turning to the business units. The following comments exclude significant variances and demonstrate our ability to meet or exceed most of our 2023 guidance ranges. Starting with RIS, fourth quarter pretax operating earnings were very strong and increased 22% over the fourth quarter of 2022 and driven by growth in the business and strong revenue retention, higher net investment income and favorable markets.Full year net revenue growth of 4% and the 39% margin were at the high end of our guided ranges. Our focus on profitable revenue growth is paying off and was aided by favorable macroeconomic impacts. PGI's pretax margin of 35% for the full year was within our guided range, a strong result compared to many of our peers, reflecting disciplined expense management while navigating a pressured revenue environment.PGI's full year revenue growth was slightly below our guided range given the market volatility as well as the industry trend of money moving to money market funds in 2023. At $34 million for the full year, performance fees ended the year in line with our outlook despite a pressured real estate market. This compares to a very strong year in 2022, which had $70 million. Performance fees are dependent on market conditions as to when we can optimize asset generation in the portfolio.Principal International ended the year strong with full year revenue growth of 9%, a 32% margin and an 11% increase in pretax operating earnings over 2022.Results benefited from growth in the business, higher AUM, positive net cash flow and foreign currency tailwinds. Both revenue growth and margin were within our guided ranges.Specialty Benefits continued to deliver in 2023 with a 9% growth in premium and fees, a 15% margin and a 17% increase in pretax operating earnings compared to full year 2022. This was fueled by another year of record sales, strong retention and employment and wage growth as well as a more favorable loss ratio. All of our metrics for Specialty Benefits were within our guided ranges.In Life, growth in premium and fees was within our guided range as our focus on business solutions is outpacing the roll-off of the legacy block. Margin was slightly below our guided range, primarily due to lower net investment income as we rightsized the assets backing the business post-transaction.Shifting to our investment portfolio, it remains high quality, aligned with our liability profile and well positioned for a variety of economic conditions. We revalued the office real estate portfolio again in the fourth quarter, as we have done quarterly throughout 2023.The commercial mortgage loan portfolio remains healthy. The average loan-to-value of 49% increased modestly throughout 2023, as we expected, while the debt service coverage ratio remains stable at 2.5x, reflecting the quality of our portfolio and our disciplined investment approach.Specific to our office exposure in the CML portfolio, there were 10 loans that matured in 2023, reducing our office loan exposure by 12%. All loans were paid off and resolved. We did not have any loan extensions or foreclosures in 2023.Looking at the 2024 office maturities, the underlying metrics are generally strong, with an average loan-to-value of 66% and debt service coverage ratio of 3.8x. We only have one maturity in the first quarter and it paid off in January. We're actively managing and remain confident in the outcome of the remaining 10 maturities, 8 of which are slated for the second half of the year.Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the year in a very strong position with $1.7 billion of excess and available capital, including approximately $935 million at the holding company, which is above our $800 million targeted level, $375 million in our subsidiaries, and $375 million in excess of our targeted 400% risk-based capital ratio, which was 427% at the end of the year.Our capital position and free cash flow reflect robust fourth quarter results and actions we took to increase capital efficiency, including the establishment of an affiliated Bermuda reinsurance entity and the closure of certain guaranteed retirement products in Hong Kong. Combined, these actions freed up more than $200 million of capital in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, we delivered 100% free capital flow conversion, including organic generation within our 75% to 85% targeted range.As shown on Slide 3, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in 2023, including $700 million of share repurchases and $625 million of common stock dividends. This included more than $400 million of capital returned to shareholders in the fourth quarter with approximately $250 million of share repurchases and $160 million of common stock dividends.Last night, we announced a $0.69 common stock dividend payable in the first quarter, a $0.02 increase from the dividend paid in the fourth quarter and in line with our targeted 40% dividend payout ratio. This demonstrates our confidence in continued growth and overall performance.We remain focused on maintaining our capital and liquidity targets at both the life company and the holding company, and we'll continue a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment.Turning to our outlook for 2024, starting on Slide 13. We are well positioned to deliver on our enterprise long-term financial targets in 2024, with 9% to 12% growth in earnings per share and 75% to 85% free capital flow conversion. In regards to EPS, benefits from growth in the business, favorable macroeconomic tailwinds and higher share repurchases are expected to more than offset continued pressure on real estate, Asia and a higher effective tax rate.Our higher growth, higher return and more capital-efficient portfolio will continue to drive an increase in return on equity, and we expect to achieve our 14% to 16% targeted range in 2025.We remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders and are targeting $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of capital deployments in 2024. This includes $800 million to $1.1 billion of share repurchases and a 40% dividend payout ratio.Our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization for $1.5 billion, this is in addition to nearly $300 million remaining under the prior authorization at the end of the year.Our guidance assumes run rate variable investment income. As usual, we'll quantify the impacts to reported results from higher or lower-than-expected variable investment income as a significant variance on our earnings calls throughout the year.Slide 21 provides details of our alternative investments. Our portfolio is more heavily weighted to real estate with a smaller allocation to private equity and hedge funds. Variable investment income is difficult to predict, but if the current macro environment persists throughout 2024, we expect continued pressure on prepayment fees and real estate returns.Turning to our business units. Our outlook for 2024 is grounded in our long-term guidance. We included some modeling considerations on Slide 14, noting where we expect to perform on an adjusted basis relative to our targeted long-term ranges.In RIS benefits from macroeconomic tailwinds and growth in the business are expected to drive revenue growth at the high end or slightly above our long-term guidance and margin at the upper end of our range.In PGI, revenue growth is expected to be at the lower end of our long-term guidance as benefits from market tailwinds are partially offset by continued pressure on real estate revenue and impacts from recent redemptions.In Principal International, margin is expected to be in line with 2023, and we're expecting low single-digit revenue growth, reflecting the impact of foreign currency translation and continued macro headwinds in Asia. While the closure of the guaranteed retirement products will impact revenue and earnings in Asia, Latin America is expected to continue to deliver strong earnings growth.In Benefits and Protection, we expect favorable loss ratios and Specialty Benefits to persist in 2024 and expect to be toward the lower half of our long-term range. The margin for life insurance is expected to be slightly below the long-term range but improved from 2023.Before opening for questions, I want to remind you of a few seasonality impacts. In PGI, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter for earnings due to the seasonality of deferred compensation and elevated payroll taxes. And in Specialty Benefits, dental claims are typically higher in the first half of the year. These factors contribute to the pattern of free capital flow, which is typically lightest in the first quarter and increases throughout the year.We have good momentum as we start 2024 with a strong capital position, and we are well positioned to deliver on our long-term financial targets. We are grounded in our growth drivers of retirement, asset management and benefits and protection and executing on a strategy focused on continuing to drive long-term shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Joel Hurwitz with Dowling & Partners.', 'Joel Hurwitz', ""Wanted to start on PGI and the outlook for the net revenue guidance. So you talked about being at the low end despite some of the market tailwinds and you referenced some of the real estate headwinds. I guess, can you just talk about your expectations for real estate-related activities in '24 and how that compares to what you experienced in 2023?"", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""Yes. I'll have -- thanks, Joel, and thanks for joining the call. I believe this is your first time to call in. It's great to have you cover PFG. And so with that, let me have Pat and Kamal (inaudible) response."", 'Patrick Gregory Halter', ""Yes, Joel, this is Pat. And great to have you on board here. I'll just make a couple of comments and then let Kamal talk a bit more, maybe specifically about flows because I think that's probably the nature of your question.As we kind of look forward relative to this year, we are starting to be more cautiously optimistic about our outlook relative to flows, Joel. We started to see more investors in the fourth quarter move into a little bit more of the risk side of the creation versus keeping money in cash and cash equivalents. I think that was predominantly driven by the fourth quarter in terms of improvements, both in the equities and the fixed income market.And our belief that with potential Fed easing later this year, we continue to see a trend, which we are seeing in the first part of this year of investors starting to engage again in some of our higher value investment activities. But Kamal will provide more input on and specifics on that."", 'Kamal Bhatia', ""Thank you, Pat. Thank you, Joel. Let me tee off where Pat left it on net cash flow because that's a big driver of your question. So as you heard Dan mention earlier in his comments, our organic growth rate was very resilient in 2023, particularly when you compare it to other active management peers over the last 12 months.As we look forward in 2024, we are encouraged by some key signals. I'll start off first with our real estate pipeline. I think we have discussed this before with you, but I'll reiterate that we have a strong $6 billion real estate pipeline, which is ready to go to work as conditions allow us.In particular, I would highlight for you, we see the greatest opportunity in 2024 of almost, I would say, roughly $1 billion of capital that we could put to work in 2 critical areas. One is private debt as the market stabilizes here, we continue to see more opportunity emerging there. And as you know, we've had a strong legacy of operating growth on the debt and equity side.And then another area where we continue to see client engagement is on the growth and income side, which is really anchored on our strength in data centers. So I would highlight those 2 areas for you on the real estate side, but there's more to it. If I look at our search activity, particularly in our specialty fixed income area, it's continuing to increase. And even in our 4Q results, we did see improved net cash flow in that area, as Dan mentioned in his opening comments.And then the last speech, which may be slow to come by, but we are seeing good progress on is clients are looking for more diversification, and our strength in small and mid-cap equities is going to be -- is a conversation, we are continuing to have with a lot more clients now. So I hope that helps you with the question you asked."", 'Joel Hurwitz', ""That was very helpful. And best of luck with the retirement, Pat. I wanted to move to pension risk transfer. So you did $2.9 billion in '23, which I think is above the $2.3 billion or $2.5 billion level that you guys had recently talked about a quarter or so ago. So just any color on what you saw in the market in Q4. And I guess what's the outlook for 2024? And how does the Bermuda subsidiary impact your growth targets on your more capital-intensive new business?"", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""I'll pass this to Chris quickly, but just to be on the record, that PRT business continues to be a strong contributor for profitability and growth of the organization with really favorable return profiles. But Chris, some additional color, please?"", 'Christopher James Littlefield', ""Thanks, Joel. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter in PRT and a very strong year overall in our PRT business. We did about $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, and that's really because we saw an opportunity. There were both capital and onboarding constraints in the industry, and we were able to take advantage of those constraints and put on some really nice PRT business at well above our targeted return levels.So really, really a great opportunity. We continue to believe we have great advantages in the PRT market, both because of our expertise in DB, the scale that we have, our focus on the small- to medium-sized type PRT opportunities, as well as our ability to capture our DB clients when they decide to do a planned termination. So if we look at the overall sales in 2023, about 20% of the premium and about 50% of the cases actually came from existing PFG customers.And so that really gives us a nice opportunity to grow our PRT business. And the team is just doing an excellent job. As we look forward to 2024, the funding levels of plans remain robust at about 107% as estimated by Mercer at the end of the year. And so we continue to expect to see strong industry sales across PRT. I think the industry is projecting something in the neighborhood of about $40 billion.We're targeting somewhere in the sort of $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for 2024, and that really is focused on as much about the returns that we're able to get. We're not trying to maximize overall PRT premiums, we're trying to get the best return on the capital that we're returning -- that we're investing in that business. So I feel really, really good about where we sit on PRT.Your last question on Bermuda, I mean, Bermuda is -- Deanna can provide more details. But Bermuda is a nice opportunity for us that we opened up in the fourth quarter. It gives us an additional ability to look at capital efficiency and again, continue to think about how do we get good returns on the capital we put in that business. So hopefully, that answers your question, Joel."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW.', 'Ryan Joel Krueger', 'My first question was on Hong Kong. Could you provide some additional detail, some of the impact specifically to the exit of the guaranteed product? And also maybe a little bit more color on why you decided to do this?', 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""Yes. I'll hit that at a high level and then pass it to Deanna. Just note that principal remains supportive of the [EMP] business reform that's going on there. Our focus continues to remain on our customer experience and making sure that we're providing fee-based investment options that are most attractive in that marketplace. But this guaranteed component was one that we didn't necessarily like to return profile, and I'll have Deanna give you some more insights on the implications on the business."", 'Deanna Dawnette Strable-Soethout', ""Yes, Ryan, just a little bit more color there. This was kind of a legacy product that we offered as part of our MPF retirement plans. But as Dan mentioned, it was more capital intensive than other investment options, and it was not meeting the return thresholds that we really wanted. So we looked at an opportunity to exit that business.And just to talk a little bit about the impact, those products had about $1 billion in AUM. We actually retained about $800 million to $900 million of it in other asset classes that did not have the same capital implications to it and $200 million actually left Principal. If you actually look at the AUM roll forward, you'll see $200 million in that operations disposed line, which is really the impact of that.From a financial perspective, it had the benefit of releasing some capital in the fourth quarter, think about magnitude of $30 million to $40 million. We actually expect a similar amount of relief on that same block early in 2024. Obviously, that is positive from a capital implication perspective, but it does have an impact on our revenue and operating earnings as we think of 2024 and will pressure on a pretax basis, our Hong Kong earnings at about $10 million."", 'Ryan Joel Krueger', 'Great. And then the other question was just on, can you give a little more information on how RIS fee flows looked in 2023 as in the SMB market and key trends you see there?', 'Daniel Joseph Houston', 'Yes. Another key market for PFG for sure. Chris, do you want to provide some additional insights there?', 'Christopher James Littlefield', 'Yes. I mean, I think we would say that SMB continues to be very resilient in overall fundamentals. Our SMB transfer deposits in SMB were up 12% on a trailing 12-month basis. When we think about recurring deposits, the SMB was up 14%. So again, we just -- we see very healthy fundamentals coming out of our small to medium-sized clients. So really, really healthy.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.', 'Suneet Laxman L. Kamath', ""Maybe just to start again on the Bermuda subsidiary. Are you looking at opportunities to put some of your in-force business in there to generate some capital efficiencies? And, if so, can you give us any kind of ballpark in terms of what you're looking to target for '24 in terms of capital free?"", 'Deanna Dawnette Strable-Soethout', ""Yes. I'll just step back a little bit, Suneet, and talk about the purpose for that entity. Again, we constantly evaluate opportunities to create value for our customers and our shareholders. That led to us setting up the entity and that was -- we did receive approval in the fourth quarter. The ultimate focus of that is to support our PRT and our term life insurance business with the ultimate focus on new sales.But to kind of start the company, we did see some in-force business to that, both on the PRT and the life side. And that did benefit us about $200 million in our free capital flow in the fourth quarter.For '24, we'll again be much more focused on using this, as Chris mentioned already for a new sale, providing us capital flexibility, allowing us to take advantage of growth at more capital-efficient levels. And ultimately, we'll assess if there's other uses there, but our focus is on that new sale other than what was needed to [save] the company."", 'Suneet Laxman L. Kamath', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess shifting to RIS fee. So one of the things that we're hearing from, I guess, one of your peers is that as participants reach retirement age, they're actually starting to take money out and put it into products that have higher yields, I'm assuming it's rollover into fixed annuities or fixed indexed annuities. So can you -- I know you gave us the lapses and the withdrawals on a consolidated basis. Can you just give us some color on what you're seeing at kind of the participant level? Are you seeing a pickup in withdrawals and maybe how current trends compared to recent years?"", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', 'Chris, please.', 'Christopher James Littlefield', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, I would say that we saw in '23 a modest increase in participant withdrawals, primarily due to overall retirements, then due to either loans or withdrawals. And so we are seeing a modest increase in the withdrawal rates there on the participants. But that being said, again, when you look at the participants, we're also seeing really healthy underlying fundamentals. We're seeing deferrals are up significantly over 8%. Matches by employers are up. So we're seeing a lot of things that are feeding overall, growing the recurring and account value growth, but we definitely are seeing an increase in some retirements, a modest increase in retirements."", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""I mean one thing to sort of note about these deposits for those people who oftentimes keep their money inside the existing 401(k) plans, it's because -- think about those as being institutionally priced. They like those investment options, so leaving money in the plan is clearly one of those options.For those that want to distance themselves from an employer, they can still obtain a rollover IRA with Principal. And again, that's a very active part of our strategy. But we also have to remember that there's a lot of people that are literally drawing down their 401(k) account balances of retirement to live off of, and that's the business that we're in.And we're fortunate also to be able to have a competitive annuity income options for these individuals. So we're not surprised. But at the same time, there's a lot of effort that goes into retaining these assets because, again, we believe we have great solutions for those individuals. But I appreciate the question."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler.', 'John Bakewell Barnidge', ""My question is around the severance. Was there a lens towards looking to more greatly unify operations of PI and Principal Global Investors now that we're further into the shared umbrella of Principal Asset Management?"", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""Yes. The reality is we always align our expenses with our revenues. And this severance is really spread across the organization in its totality. There's not a lot of fanfare around that, but it's making sure that we're just aligning expenses accordingly. So there isn't any one spot and it's Principal's ongoing efforts to manage its expenses. And again, that's no different than what we've done previously, John. So hopefully, that helps."", 'John Bakewell Barnidge', 'It does. My follow-up question. Lots of companies have been calling out the opportunity for supplemental voluntary products as a growth vertical. Can you maybe talk about the opportunity set for your company as well as general product development pipeline for benefits?', 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""Yes, I'll throw that over to Amy, just a second. I was actually looking back at our Principal well-being indexed that was done back in November. And again, it was ironic, the SMBs actually have a 65% favorable outlook from a financial perspective. 73% [fee] looks getting better from here, and they also cite specifically benefits as a way to attract and retain talent. So again, it's a very favorable environment for SMBs and of course, Amy is one of our best subject matter experts on this. Amy?"", 'Amy Christine Friedrich', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. And Dan, you've got it right. There's an appetite for these products. There's a need for them. What I would say is most people see the use of these supplemental products, not as a replacement for some of the core coverages they're putting in place. So we're still seeing a high interest in getting core income replacement products done.Small and midsized businesses are still taking care of their major medical needs. But we're adding on these critical illness, the accident, the hospital indemnity to help cover the things that aren't covered by some of the other pieces of insurance. So when you look at like high deductible plan that you'd have to get up to $7,500 before the plan would kick in to help pay, it's helping meet some of those expenses. So what I would say is these products in our portfolio make a ton of sense. And you've seen us add critical illness, you've seen us add accident, and you've seen us add most recently, hospital indemnity.That's giving us the ability to have a worksite portfolio that helps complement the things that they're doing. We're expecting and are seeing growth in excess of 15%, up to 20% on those product sets now are based on those sets is pretty small, but it's responsive to the marketplace.The last point I would offer is those are also giving us the ability to put the type of financial security in place that if people have those benefits in place, they're better able to participate in some of the other programs like saving in a 401(k). We're investing in the places that make sense for them as an investor so that if you've got these products in place, then our ability to extend to other pieces of Principal's great product set is even higher."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.', 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""Let's see, a couple of questions. First is just on alternative returns. I think you're assuming in line with your long-term expectation, but then there was a footnote just saying if current conditions persist in real estate, in particular, you would -- I guess, potentially you're going to come in below that. Can you just sort of clarify what you're thinking on that? Do you -- would you expect alternatives to be softer in 1Q or 2Q based on what you're seeing today?"", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""This is where you wish you had a great crystal ball of which we don't. Deanna, do you want to provide some additional color?"", 'Deanna Dawnette Strable-Soethout', ""Yes. Tom, thanks for the question there. The first thing I would reiterate is our ranges that we put out there for margin and revenue growth are all on an ex significant basis. And obviously, the last few years, variable investment income has been one that we have called out as it has run below our actual level. Just to put that in a little bit of perspective, our run rate return for our portfolio is in that 8% to 8.5% range. And we actually came in, in '23 more in that 6% to 7% level. And we did provide on the slide deck an actual breakdown of our alternative portfolio, which is about -- a little over a $5 billion portfolio.So given the kind of the difficulty in actually predicting that we felt it was prudent to give you guidance on a run rate basis and also because we actually see a path to getting to that run rate basis, either late in '24 as we think about 2025 and I know you're aware, but our portfolio is more weighed or heavily concentrated in real estate and has less allocation to private equity and hedge funds.If we think of '23, we actually -- the places where we fell below our expectations was prepays, not surprising given the interest rate environment and the elements of our bond portfolio and also real estate, which, again, more of ours comes from real estate transactions and '23 was obviously not a time to actually take advantage of that.Our all -- our private equity and hedge actually performed better than we expected and again helped to offset some of the impact that we saw there. So one of the things that, again, it's probably easier to think about the next quarter or 2 than it is the full year. Prepays and real estate transactions will probably run below our expectations. But it's interesting, if we actually did have VII be at the same level that we experienced in '23, our reported EPS would actually be in that 9% to 12% growth rate as well as our adjusted and our outlook. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color."", 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""That does. And just for a follow-up, just could you provide what's embedded in your guide related to both net flows in RIS and PGI?"", 'Deanna Dawnette Strable-Soethout', 'Yes. I think probably Kamal and Chris would be in the best position to talk through that.', 'Patrick Gregory Halter', ""Yes. So I think from a look forward perspective, Tom, we're seeing improvement from 2023. As Kamal highlighted, we're seeing improvement in our broad range of investment activities, starting with fixed income. And we think fixed income is going to be a benefactor and a recipient of the Fed policy actions that we believe and are assuming to occur later this year in terms of -- sort of about Fed, that easy.So that's the first sort of protocol relative to, I think, flows coming in a more positive direction in 2024. Come highlight real estate. We still have a very balanced approach in terms of what we can do in real estate. Both in terms of the pipeline and the opportunities, both in debt and data centers and other specialized investment activities. We don't talk about this enough, but Europe is actually a very active place for us right now also in terms of real estate. And so that's the area just to highlight, and we have some emerging opportunities in Asia in future to talk about.And then I think in terms of what Kamal highlighted, just to sort of, again, reiterate, we see some really strong interest in equity activity, particularly in the small and mid-cap. So -- but to round it out, I'll let Kamal sort of finish out sort of the things that we didn't discuss."", 'Kamal Bhatia', ""Sure. So Tom, I think Pat covered it well. The only other data point I'd add for you, you asked about NCF. From where we sit in asset management, I think we are managing the whole business for revenue and margin as well. It's critical, as you know, we have a very large book of business across retirement, wealth and institutional.And as you'll see in our stable fee rate both in 4Q, we are acutely focused on retention. But as Pat mentioned and I mentioned earlier, we do see growth on our institutional segment. So I think as we have guided in Deanna's comments, I think we are looking at a stable margin guidance at this stage, where we obviously make sure our expenses are in line with our revenue, and we've also given some revenue guidance, but those are the measures we are looking at in addition to NCF."", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', 'Chris, any color?', 'Christopher James Littlefield', ""Yes. I think from an RES perspective, Tom, it's very difficult to project net cash flows for full year. As you know, we see a lot of seasonality in the fourth quarter and a lot of activity for planned transitions and lineup changes. I think what I'd also reiterate what we said before, which is net cash flow is just one measure to look at and not all net cash flow is not created equal, and we're really focused on increasing revenue and the profitable growth in our book is really where we're focused.And I think you'll see our results and the guidance for '24 are very consistent with that approach to managing the business. What I would say is we're going to continue to remain disciplined on the pricing. We're going to drive more revenue. And as we look toward '24, we see continued strong transfer deposits. We see solid recurring deposit growth. And we see a moderation in the contract lapse rate, all of which is leading to that revenue guidance at or above our long-term range and margin at the upper end of our long-term range. So that's how I'd respond to the question, Tom."", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', 'Thanks for the question, Tom.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.', 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""Pat, good luck, and congratulations with your retirement. I had a question first for Chris on RIS fee flows. And it's along the lines that you've discussed in response to other questions as well. But if you think about the environment overall for retirement plan should be pretty good with the tight labor market, strong GDP growth and yet your flows have been negative each of the last 2 years and each of the last 3 quarters. So I think some of it was the wells lapses. Some of it, it seems like from your comments that you're implying that the market is competitive and you're trying to stay disciplined on price.So what -- if you could just give us some detail on what are the various factors that are driving weak flows, and to what extent is it environmental versus maybe company specific and you could talk about 23% and the fourth quarter as well?"", 'Christopher James Littlefield', ""Yes. I mean, I think what I'd say is we've previously talked on calls about the competitive environment remains competitive on flows. We've also talked about us wanting to make sure that we have the right plans that we have in our portfolio and are very focused on making sure that we have profitable plans. I think you've seen in the past 1.5 years or 2 years, we've had some large plans leave that have had very negligible impact on net revenue.And so again, our focus is on revenue, not flows, and it will remain that way as we go. Flows is an important measure for us to look at, but we're trying to remain disciplined in the business that we put on.And again, I'd also say the fourth quarter is historically a negative quarter as we look into '24 in the first quarter, in particular, we see positive net cash flow in the first quarter and significantly above last year's first quarter. So again, we're watching flows. It's an important dynamic for us, but we're really, really focused on finding all the ways that we can generate revenue across our platform as well as focusing on those plans that are healthy and profitable for us to continue to maintain."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""Okay. And then just for -- maybe Dan, on -- there's been a lot of noise about pension reform in Chile and nothing concrete has actually happened yet, but what are your views on the most likely outcome? And how does it impact Principal's business?"", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""Yes. I appreciate that. And just to follow on Chris' response there. No discount to the value creation of what Chris and his team have done around improving the customer experience, continuing to build out total retirement solutions, our ability to gather assets for the asset management part of the organization and feed the rest of the organization.So from our perspective, it's a very valuable franchise, and Chris and his team have done an excellent job ensuring that the business we serve is profitable business. We don't need practice in record keeping. So with that, as it relates to Chile, as you know, this has been an ongoing reform discussion. It's been going on for years. The constitutional reform was not successful. One of the outcomes of that was further conversations around pension reform. And we start with doing what's in the best interest of Chilean people.And right now what they tell us and through surveys and feedback is they want a choice in their provider, they want choice in investment options, and this has been very consistent. So effectively, Chileans have rejected the idea of a state-owned AFP providing more value than what the private sector has.So we continue to be very vigilant working with regulators, working with the legislators and continue to work in the industry to make sure that what is available in the AFP is competitive from a fee perspective, the investment options, which it is and to continue to serve the best interest of Chileans. But again, we feel reasonably confident on the industry's ability to demonstrate that and make our case to elected officials. Appreciate the question."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.', 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""First question I had was on RIS. And I just wanted to see if you could provide maybe just high-level commentary on the competitive environment. I think, a little bit more of the business sort of goes through a renewal towards the end of the year, beginning of the year. I'm just interested in how that's gone? And if there's any pricing considerations that we should think through is we're looking at the net revenue guidance and thinking through revenue in 1Q?"", 'Christopher James Littlefield', ""Yes. Thanks, question. Again, we feel really good about the position our business is in. And all of those competitive pressures are built into our guidance, it still shows us benefiting from both the macroeconomic environment as well as the growth in our block and the increase in revenue generation across our block. So we are seeing a competitive environment. I think that's going to continue.But we've been able to really succeed despite that competition. I mean, WSRS sales were up 14% for the year, fee-based transfer deposits were up 17% on a trailing 12-month basis. We had really, really strong revenue retention this year. And so overall, we feel really good about the underlying business fundamentals and our ability to compete and win clients from other providers. So feel really good about where we sit in the market."", 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""That's helpful. Next one I have is on the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. I was just interested if you talk about maturities you have this year. I know you gave some numbers in the deck. I'd just be interested in color around how that's going, working through those maturities. And if there's anything we should think about as it relates to the -- I guess, it was around 7% of the office portfolio that's getting closer to 100 LTV with that service coverage under 100 -- sorry, under 1."", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""There was a fitting way to end this call and have it go to the one person retiring who has probably the most knowledgeable -- knowledge of IFRS 9 around commercial real estate. It's Pat. So Pat, can you provide us some of your insights on this one?"", 'Patrick Gregory Halter', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. Obviously, real estate in office, in particular, is under the radar screen. And we are absolutely laser-focused on our portfolio and ensuring it's being valued, it's being underwritten and it's being monitored and managed appropriately. Just to level set a little bit, Alex, we have about $3 billion remaining in our overall commercial mortgage loan portfolio that's in office. High-quality office, Class A, predominantly 60% loan to value and then office portfolio, that's where the 30% reduction in earning valuations. As you know, we appraised and Deanna highlights earlier, we've appraised our office portfolio on a quarterly basis. So that's a current loan-to-value, 2.6x debt service coverage, that portfolio is 89% occupied currently.Specifically to your question, Alex, we have 11 loans that are maturing in 2024 in the office category. And as highlighted earlier, one of those loans already have paid off. But we really are going into that portfolio with a very strong position; the remaining 10 loans, 66% loan to value.But what I really want to highlight are 3 things. One is the debt service coverage ratio, which is 3.8. Secondly, it's 94% occupied in terms of that portfolio. And thirdly, the lease term is 5.6 years remaining in that office portfolio. So that $440 million remaining that is expected to mature for the remaining part of 2024. Three of those loans are under $6 million in loan balance that remains 7 loans which, as I think Deanna highlighted 80% of those loans are going to be maturing in the second half of the year.As I mentioned, we do intensive underwriting each one of those loans. Of those 7 loans, we don't see any sort of issues at this point in time relative to any credit losses, and they are all current and paying. We have a lot of institutional investors in some of those loans. Again, high-quality loan portfolio, and with the sort of going in debt service coverage ratio, occupancy and the long-term leases still remaining in that overall portfolio. We continue to feel fairly good about the portfolio as we move it forward into the year. We'll continue to monitor that very closely.The last thing you highlighted, Alex, was there are -- I think we provided in the deck, there's a small portion of our overall portfolio. I think it's about 1.5% of overall portfolio, about (inaudible) of the office portfolio for about $200 million. That equates to about $200 million. That's in 4 loans. We continue to monitor those very, very carefully. We see probably one stress point in one of those loans today. So we could see a minor loss reserve around those loans as we look forward in the next quarter.But that's all we see at this point in time, but we'll continue to monitor those loans also. But the portfolio is in a very good place. It's in a good shape right now. But clearly, we have to be respectful of the challenges in the marketplace and the liquidity and the headwinds that continue to remain probably for the next couple of quarters."", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', 'Thanks for the question, Alex.', 'Operator', 'Our last question is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.', 'Joshua David Shanker', ""I guess this one is for Amy. Looking at the long-term guidance range around the medical benefit ratio around 60% to 65%, you guys did 61% this year. A lot of other companies in the space are putting a much wider variance from the long-term expected average, 6 midpoint of the range 2.5%, you're not that far away right now. Is dental providing some sort of ballast that's more normal compared to other things? Or should we think that there's something different in the portfolio at Principal that's basically causing to be normally good results as opposed to usually outsized good results on the benefits?"", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', 'Amy, please?', 'Amy Christine Friedrich', ""Yes. You've hit it right in mentioning dental. A lot of the other -- when I look across the industry, a lot of the other changes that I'm seeing happen are with portfolios that are either primarily or solely kind of that life and disability portfolio. And again, when I look across our results for life and disability, I feel really comfortable that we're setting ourselves up with a loss ratio range that's going to give us both the right appropriate growth prospects and profitability.Dental does have a more highly utilized product. It does tend to have a different rhythm to the business. I think the great news there is that third and fourth quarter, we continue to see a moderation of that loss ratio for us. So we're seeing sort of heading back into more normal cycles for dental. And that does fuel some of our confidence in the ranges that we're giving.Now what I would say is I'd just reiterate that Deanna mentioned in her earlier comments, we do expect 2024 loss ratios to be in that lower end of the range. So I feel really good about those comments and the beginning of the year experience on those products looks strong."", 'Joshua David Shanker', ""And is that lower end life and disability driven or it's the whole kit and caboodle is going to be at the lower end?"", 'Amy Christine Friedrich', ""Well, to use your technical term, the whole kit and caboodle is going to be at the lower end. So that is a full portfolio comments that I'm giving you."", 'Daniel Joseph Houston', 'Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that question, Josh.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Mr. Houston, your closing comments, please.', 'Daniel Joseph Houston', ""I appreciate that. And thank you for your time today on the call. As you can tell, we're very confident about our go-forward strategy and the value we're able to create for our customers and our shareholders. Once again, Pat, thank you for your 40 years of service.

If you have additional questions please re-queue. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don?', ""Donald Wood: Thanks, Leah. And good afternoon, everybody. Well, 2023 is in the books. With a strong $1.64 recorded in the fourth quarter, finish off what is an all-time record earnings year at $6.55 of FFO per share. That's happening, despite over $600 million of construction in progress not yet contributing and higher interest expense that cost the Trust an additional $0.27 per share when compared with the average rate in 2022. Yet, with comparable money cost between 2022 and 2023, FFO growth per share would have been 8%, right up there with our best pre-COVID years. It says a lot in terms of the power of the portfolio that has grown bottom line FFO per share at a compound annual growth rate of 4.5% over the last 20 years in addition to an average uninterrupted dividend yield of roughly 3% or better."", ""That includes the great financial crisis, that includes the global pandemic, it includes everything, a better portfolio to own for long term investors in our opinion. It also feels like we're getting closer to a time where accelerated acquisition activity coupled with our redevelopment and remerchandising expertise on new acquisitions could boost that growth rate over the next few years. As far as today’s environment demand continues to exceed supply for the highest quality assets in the closed-in suburbs and with the impacts of the pandemic in the rearview mirror and lack of new supply coming on, I don't see this positive supply demand dynamic changing anytime soon. Our average in-place rents portfolio wide are $31.60 per foot and the comparable retail deals we did in the fourth quarter were at $44.57 a foot and we're at $36.75 for the entire year."", ""I've been hearing that our rents are high and can't be pushed further for the better part of the last 20 years. And I guess on a relative basis they are. Better properties have higher rents. Better properties have higher tenant sales and profitability too. Frankly, it's obvious. Percentage rents are an interesting barometer on this topic. While we push for a strong fixed rent in nearly every lease, tenant sales above a threshold level equates to additional rent. Percentage rent and overage rent totaled $6 million in the fourth quarter and $19.3 million for the year, an all-time record, which broke the $18.8 million record from the year earlier. Fourth quarter retail leasing continued to crank with another 100 comparable retail deals done at 12% rollover on a cash basis, 23% on a straight line basis."", 'These comparable retail deals account for virtually all 98% of the total retail deals done in the quarter, making them representative of the entire portfolio, not just a fraction. It was a great leasing year, the third in a row where we exceeded 2 million square feet, roughly 25% more than the five year average during 2015 and 2019. Just to pound the point home, those cash basis rollover increases come on comp of leases that have had what I believe to be the highest contractual rent bumps throughout their term in the sector, making that rollover all the more impressive. Contractual rent bumps for the deals done in the fourth quarter were roughly 2.5% blended anchor and small shop, with new and renewal small shop at approximately 3%. The weighted average contractual rent bumps for the entire retail portfolio, anchor and small shop not just one quarter’s worth, but the whole thing approximates 2.25%.', ""Best in the business as far as we can tell. The sustained leasing volume and related economics bode well for the future, especially the contractual rent loss. We ended the year with overall portfolio leased at 94.2%, pretty strong but with room to grow. That breaks down between anchors at 96% leased and shop space at 90.7%. When you look at our occupancy possibilities going forward by looking at our past, it's reasonable to expect another 100 basis points of small shelf occupancy and another 200 basis points of anchor occupancy improvement in the coming 12 to 18 months, depending, of course, on the extent of future bankruptcies that we are not seeing today, they're not at all obvious. The residential and office product at our mixed use properties continues to outperform competing supply in non-mixed use environments and stood at 96% leased for both our comparable resi and comparable mixed use office product at year end, while commanding premium rents."", ""Progress leasing up our mixed use office under development 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose and Santana West has been measurably stronger with 215,000 square feet newly leased or in the final stages of the LOI to sign the lease process. That includes the first signed deal at Santana West with Acrisure, the global FinTech leader to the insurance sector. With those deals complete, 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose will be 80% leased And Santana West will be nearly half leased up. I go through all this to really try to hammer home the obvious health of the business centered around leasing high quality retail centric properties in the closed-in suburbs of America's greatest cities. While bottom line results are and will continue to be muted by the higher, but certainly historically reasonable cost of capital that is stabilizing, rents will likely continue to adjust upward over time to that reality."", ""This is especially true for tenants in locations and affluent areas where customers can absorb higher costs. I hope that higher interest rates don't cloud investors appreciation of the strong underlying business fundamentals that exist today and likely tomorrow. With that backdrop, we're also really excited to add a substantial expansion to the 87 unit first phase of residential product that we built at Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center in suburban Philadelphia a few years back. The first phase opened strong and remains fully leased with growing rents. Strong supply and demand dynamics in this closed-in part of Philadelphia's mainline along with construction costs moderating means that we're able to build an additional 217 residential units, 16,000 feet of additional retail and the covered parking spaces to service it all."", ""On the former Lord & Taylor site at Bala Cynwyd. The shopping center features an expansive tenant roster including an LA fitness gym, a full service grocer, restaurants and necessary services, which are often cited as the reason residents are choosing it. Projects should get underway later this year beginning with demo of the old Lord & Taylor building which should yield a 7% cash on cost return when stabilized, throw out a double digit unlevered IRR based on the rent growth we've seen and expect and be funded from free cash flow. Okay. On to 2024 where we certainly expect another record earnings year with an energized team and a strong sense of optimism. Dan will go into a bunch more detail and I'll turn it over to him and then open it up to your questions."", 'Dan?', 'Dan Guglielmone: Thank you, Don. Hello everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.64 for the fourth quarter and $6.55 for the year were up 3.8% and 3.6% respectively versus 2022. POI was up 6.5% in fourth quarter, a more impressive 7.2% for the year. Primary drivers for the strong performance in 2023: first, POI growth in our comparable portfolio up almost 5% on a cash basis excluding prior period rents and term fees, driven by both higher rents and higher average occupancy over the course of the year, driven by continued strength, consumer traffic and tenant sales, particularly in our mixed use assets driving parking revenues and overage percentage rent higher. Effectively, controlling property level expenses and having a lower credit reserve than we originally forecast.', ""Second, contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline, which came in at the upper end of our forecast. And lastly, continued focus on overall expense controls, the G&A came in below expectations. This was offset primarily by higher interest rate headwinds totaling $0.27. To reiterate Don's point earlier, with a consistent cost of debt versus 2022, FFO per share growth year-over-year would have been 8% in 2023. Reflecting an exceptionally strong year of growth at the property level. GAAP based comparable POI growth came in at 4% for the fourth quarter and 3.2% for the year. At a comparable cash basis, excluding the impact of prior period rent and term fees, growth was 5.2% for the fourth quarter and 4.7% for the year. As a reminder, this information including components of prior period rent, term fees and GAAP to cash adjustments can be found on page 12 of our quarterly 8-K supplement."", 'Our residential portfolio continues to be a source of strength despite headwinds in the broader residential sector. Same store residential POI growth was 5.8% in 4Q along with revenue growth for the quarter at 6%. We expect this strength to continue into 2024. The value proposition providing a premium residential offering on top of an attractive retail amenity base is driving outperformance across our targeted residential portfolio. Also a big driver of our growth in 2023 was continued stabilization of a large portion of our redevelopment and expansion pipeline as $18 million of incremental POI came online from our $750 million in process pipeline. And we expect that to be the case moving forward as well as we add new projects to the lineup and maintain that part of our business as a continued driver of growth.', ""The scale and skill set of our redevelopment program is a key differentiator for Federal. Notable updates to our in process pipeline, which will contribute an additional $9 million to $12 million of POI in 2024 include $115 million Darien Commons Projects in Connecticut where the residential is fully stabilized 98.4%, occupancy with rents above $4 per foot per month, well above underwriting. Tenant retention rates remain above 90% and the retail component approaches 90% leased. A testament to what a strong retail amenity base can bring to a residential project. At the $190 million 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose, Choice Hotels fully moved in as they opened in 4Q, plus they've taken additional space. Sodexo's U.S. headquarters is next on deck to open with multiple other tenants actively negotiating leases."", ""At Huntington Shopping Center on Long Island, this $85 million Whole Foods anchored redevelopment is over 90% leased with new anchor REI opening during the Q4 in addition to a number of small shops. We feel very good about the yield on this project, approaching the top end of our 7% to 8% return range. For those of you in the New York area, it's worth a trip out to Central Long Island later this year after Whole Foods opens to check it out. As well as the Melville asset a mile further south, both are exceptional retail redevelopments which truly highlight Federal skill set. Additionally in 2023, we incrementally invested over $120 million in properties we only partially owned previously at an effective 8.1% cap rate. No better risk adjusted investment than deploying capital accretively into assets we know extremely well."", 'Unlevered IRRs on these investments are in the double digits. Now to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position. As you all saw, we refinanced our $600 million bond maturities, which came due on January 15 for a combination of a $200 million secured loan on our Bethesda Row property at an effective 5% fixed rate for the first two years of the loan plus two one year extensions that are effectively a four year loan and a $485 million, 3.25% exchangeable notes offering due 2029 raised in early January at an effective 3.9% interest rate all in. Part of that transaction, we purchased a call spread to increase the effective strike price on the convert of 40%, up above $143 per share. So no incremental economic solution unless the common stock trades above that level as adjusted.', 'Pro forma of the most recent financings and dividends paid, our liquidity stands above $1.3 billion with an undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility and available cash on hand. Plus we have no maturities remaining in 2024 and no material maturities until 2026. Our leverage metrics continue to be strong as fourth quarter annualized net debt to EBITDA stands at 5.9 times and that metric should improve over the course of 2024 and hit our target of 5.5 times in 2025. Fixed charge coverage was 3.6 times at year end and that metric should continue to improve as incremental EBITDA comes online and interest rates fall over the second half of 2024. Now, on to guidance. For 2024, we are introducing an FFO per share forecast of $6.65 to $6.87 per share. This represents over 3% growth at the midpoint of $6.76 and roughly 5% at the high end of the range.', 'This is driven by comparable growth of 2.5% to 4% when excluding prior period rents and term fees, 3.25% at the midpoint. This assumes occupancy levels will increase from 92.2% at 12/31, up to roughly 93% by year end 2024. Although expect to step back in the Q1 due to expected seasonality post holidays.

You might have a checklist of traits you would like to see in your next $1,000 investment. I get the feeling that Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) would check off most of the boxes."", ""The very definition of growth requires healthy top-line jumps, and the company behind functional sparkling beverages has that in strides. If it hits Wall Street's fourth-quarter target in a couple of weeks it will be the third year in a row of revenue growth of 99% or better. If you like longer timelines, it will be Celsius' fourth straight year of better than 74% growth within a seven-year run of increasing its top line by at least 43%."", ""There's more to this story than just big numbers. The future is pretty bright, too. Let's take a closer look at why this beverage industry disruptor is the ultimate growth stock."", ""A quick primer on what makes Celsius unique is in order. It makes fruit-flavored carbonated beverages that don't just taste pretty great. The beverages have a proprietary blend of ingredients that help trigger thermogenesis, safely and temporarily warming up your body temperature to the point where it boosts your metabolism. It makes it easier to burn fat and calories, especially if consumed ahead of a workout or any kind of cardio activity."", ""You can argue that a company upending the stodgy world of beverage stocks -- roughly doubling its share of the energy drink market in each of the last three years -- is going to attract copycats and imitators. I'm not saying you would be wrong, but folks have been making the same argument against PepsiCo's\xa0Gatorade or Coca-Cola for generations. I'll get back to PepsiCo in a moment."", ""Successful growth stocks also crank out beautiful stock charts. Celsius is a 49-bagger over the last five years. It's a short list of stocks that have performed better, and Celsius still being off most investing radars is a grave disservice to folks tapping the market for life-altering wealth."", 'Another hallmark of a winning growth stock is its ability to consistently put out ""beat and raise"" performances. Celsius is routinely trouncing Wall Street expectations, leading analysts to jack up their projections that the beverage speedster will also exceed with ease. Celsius isn\'t just profitable now. It has landed ahead of Wall Street profit targets by at least 85% in each of its last three quarterly reports.', ""A lot of market darlings have a couple of years of growth before fizzing out, but Celsius is aiming higher. The catalysts are there for future upticks. Here's where PepsiCo steps back into the story. The pop star invested $550 million for an 8.5% convertible preferred stake in Celsius two summer ago. The move made PepsiCo its new domestic distribution partner. The partnership has opened new doors. It initially got Celsius stocked in hotel chains, airports, and casinos. Lately it's been a food service push. You can now buy a Celsius at the more than 2,700 Jersey Mike's sub shops, and it recently began popping up at Dunkin' stores."", ""It's not just about stateside growth. Last month Celsius announced its expansion into Canada, Great Britain, and Ireland. PepsiCo is leading the way in Canada with a different distributor tackling its transatlantic push."", 'Growth will inevitably slow at some point. Analysts see revenue rising just 39% this year, but Celsius has punked Wall Street pros before. Bottom-line gains could grow even slower as it invests in making itself a global brand, but the long-term benefits far outweigh any short-term sacrifices.', ""Another potential catalyst is a short squeeze. Short interest was at an all-time high earlier this month, with bearish bets being placed on 16% of Celsius' outstanding shares. Another blowout performance -- like last time when it called for a 3-for-1 stock split -- could send the naysayers scrambling for cover."", 'Celsius is an ultimate growth stock. The cans may be svelte, but its appreciation potential continues to be wide.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Celsius wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of high dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks in the Dow.\xa0', 'Dividend yield holds significant importance in dividend investing, serving as a key metric for investors. Experts often recommend prioritizing companies that demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payouts over time. Nevertheless, there is also notable interest among investors in companies offering high dividend yields. Over time, high-yielding stocks and companies with consistent dividend growth have demonstrated comparable performance, showing a close race in their investment returns. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series employs a distinctive methodology aimed at tracking the performance of 100 stocks with high dividend yields across various markets. These stocks are chosen based on their consistent history of dividend payments and strong fundamental metrics. Over the long term, this index has demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains compared to standard benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index achieved an annualized total return of 11.7%, surpassing its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which yielded 10.2% annually. Similarly, in the international market, the Dow Jones International Dividend 100 Index outperformed its benchmark, the S&P Global Ex-U.S. LargeMidCap, in both price return and total return over the past 15 years.', 'Heartland Advisors conducted an in-depth analysis utilizing data provided by Kenneth French, sourced from the US Stock Database Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. This dataset encompassed all equity securities listed on major US exchanges, including NYSE, Amex, NASDAQ, and NYSE Arca, spanning from 1928 through 2017. The study focused on examining monthly and annual value-weighted total returns of non-dividend-paying U.S. stocks and five portfolios consisting of dividend-paying stocks. These portfolios were constructed based on dividend yields. The research tracked the performance of each portfolio from January 1928 to December 2017, with dividends reinvested. Notably, the findings revealed that all portfolios comprising dividend-paying stocks outperformed the portfolio comprised solely of non-dividend-paying stocks over the entire period studied. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, in general, portfolios with higher dividend yields tended to outperform those with lower dividend yields. This suggests a positive correlation between dividend yield and investment performance, with higher-yielding quintiles demonstrating stronger returns compared to lower-yielding quintiles.', ""The impressive performance of high-yielding dividend stocks has garnered significant popularity among investors, leading many to turn to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a key source for such investment opportunities. Employing a strategy known as the 'Dogs of the Dow', investors focus on acquiring the highest-yielding stocks within the DJIA. The outcomes of this strategy have been varied and inconsistent over time. According to data sourced from Barron's in one of our articles, over a 20-year period ending in 2023, the Dogs of the Dow strategy yielded an average annual return slightly above 8%, inclusive of dividends. This performance lags behind the S&P 500 by a little over 1% annually. However, when assessing the period from the end of 2003 to 2018, the Dogs of the Dow were actually outperforming the S&P 500 by approximately 1% each year."", 'Verizon Communications Inc.
