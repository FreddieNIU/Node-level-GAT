Beyond bricks and mortar, the sector creates jobs, services, and growth across the continental United States. Also, real estate stocks let you invest without buying actual buildings. It’s like owning a small part of the companies rather than the properties themselves. As a result, real estate stocks are a popular choice among investors.', 'Popular as the sector might be, many people have been pessimistic about the market’s current condition. High real estate prices, high mortgage rates, and low inventory remain prevalent. And this has had its effect on real estate in general.', 'Despite the setbacks, some companies offer refuge by offering a stable dividend and growth opportunities. Here are some of the most promising real estate stocks to look at right now.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is the first real estate stock on the list.

American Tower was recently named Top 25 “Dividend Giant” with “a staggering” $14.86 billion in ETF-held stock.', 'Today, the company pays a 3.14% dividend yield, has a consistent payout history, and has strong long-term growth, solidifying its industry position. AMT’s third-quarter financials show strong growth despite a dip in net income. Total revenue rose 5.5% to $2.819 billion, mostly driven by a 7% increase in property revenue to $2.792 billion. Adjusted EBITDA also grew 10.4% to $1.814 billion, although net income fell 29.6% to $577 million. All in all, 19 analysts rate AMT a strong buy rating with a high estimate of $259, representing 20% upside potential.', 'With all that being said, AMT represents a promising investment opportunity and one of the best real estate stocks to buy.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'The next real estate stock on our list is Alexandria Real Estate Equities (NYSE:ARE). Like American Towers, the company is an REIT that has been around for almost 30 years. Alexandria manages over 75-million square feet of properties across research centers in North America, serving over 800 high-profile tenants. These include companies specializing in life science, agricultural tech, and technology campuses.', 'Today, its market capitalization is roughly $20 billion. The company recently announced a 2.4% dividend increase to $1.27 per share for the fourth quarter this year, up from $1.24 last quarter. The dividend ex-date is Dec. 28 and will be paid out on Jan. 12, 2024.', 'ARE delivered solid financial results in the third quarter, with net income rising 7.9% year-over-year to $1.8 billion. This growth builds on consistent positive trends in the company’s same property net operating income.', 'Looking ahead, ARE’s decision to incorporate a 3% annual rent increase in 96% of its leases helps ensure future profitability. Their balance sheet also reflects robust liquidity of $5.9 billion and no debt maturities due before 2025.

Ranking as the 19th largest REIT in the S&P 500, Ventas has delivered an impressive 17% annualized return to shareholders since 1999.', 'The company reported positive financial growth in the third quarter. Net operating income increased by 5.1%, while same-store cash net operating Income jumped by 7.9%. This growth came from higher occupancy rates, increased revenue per occupied room, and controlled operating expenses, resulting in a 230 basis point margin expansion. Although net loss per share was $0.18 for the quarter, this was recorded as a non-cash impairment on real estate assets held for sale. The company maintained a dividend of $0.45 per share, translating to a 3.85% yield.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase State Street's shares before the 29th of December to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.69 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.76 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that State Street has a trailing yield of 3.6% on the current share price of $77.19. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether State Street can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for State Street ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately State Street's payout ratio is modest, at just 37% of profit."", 'Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.', ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see State Street earnings per share are up 7.6% per annum over the last five years."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, State Street has lifted its dividend by approximately 10% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", 'Has State Street got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? State Street has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. Overall, State Street looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.', ""In light of that, while State Street has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for State Street you should know about."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

According to industry research from SEMI.org, equipment spending for new wafer fabs (facilities that manufacture silicon wafers, which get cut into chips) will hit new records in the next few years through 2026.', ""But one company is moving in a different direction: Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO). It just announced it's selling its chip manufacturing facilities in China as it looks to get itself in better financial shape in the years to come. With Qorvo shaking things up, is it now a buy for 2024?"", 'Qorvo is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM), a company that both designs and manufactures chips. It\'s the product of a ""merger of equals"" back in 2015 between the two chipmakers RFMD and TriQuint. The idea behind the consolidation was to create a leaner (more profitable) chipmaking powerhouse focused on radio frequency, power, and other mobile chips and sensors.', ""As I pointed out back in September, the benefits of this merger have never really panned out. I posited that Qorvo's sprawling manufacturing footprint isn't being efficiently used, and perhaps some of its underperforming facilities should be sold off to bolster profit margins (Qorvo has mostly lagged behind its peers in basic profit metrics)."", 'A deal was certainly already in the works long before I wrote this, but sure enough, Qorvo just announced it is selling its two chip packaging facilities in Beijing and Dezhou, China. Chip packaging is the final step in which chips are tested and installed onto a circuit board, before getting installed into a computing or electronics system. It tends to be a highly commoditized step with below-average profit margins compared to wafer manufacturing (Qorvo will retain its wafer fabs in North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, and Florida, as well as its other assembly and test facilities in Costa Rica, Philippines, and Germany).', 'This is a good first step for Qorvo to finally get its sprawling manufacturing operations right-sized for customer demand. And as for its facilities in China, they are being bought by Luxshare Precision Industry, a big contract manufacturer used by the likes of Apple for some of its products. Qorvo will retain use of these facilities to assemble its chips, but will offload the expensive management of day-to-day operations to Luxshare. The deal should be finalized by mid-2024.', ""The final sale price was not disclosed, but no doubt we'll get some details from Qorvo's financial reports next year. Interestingly, the Dezhou facility was the latest one Qorvo built, finished up in 2016. It was likely a painful decision, but one that will be key to Qorvo scaling profitably going forward."", ""Of course, another tailwind could be getting ready to blow in Qorvo's favor next year. The smartphone market has been in a slump since late 2022, but chip inventories are normalizing. That could pave the way for the next leg up for the company's revenue -- not to mention the expected overall industry boom over the next few years. However, some temporary weakness in other markets, like automotive chips, could offset some of this progress in the first half of the new year."", ""There's thus a long road ahead to recovery, but the market could be pleased with even a hint of positive momentum at this point. Qorvo stock is still down over 40% from all-time highs reached in 2021, and trades for just 14 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for next year's earnings. This could be a cheap stock, especially once Qorvo rounds the bend on turning a profit again."", 'If you like uncovering undervalued stocks, Qorvo could be a semiconductor company worth doing some digging on. 2024 could be a good year for the business after its China chip assembly sale in an attempt to shore up its bottom line.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Qorvo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Qorvo, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Qorvo wasn't one of them.

These stocks are sought after for their track record of rewarding shareholders and are considered a cornerstone of a conservative and income-oriented investment strategy. Dividend growth stocks increasingly captivated market participants who are in pursuit of potential market outperformance and appealing yields. This trend gained momentum notably after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis when interest rates plummeted to historic lows. The subsequent environment of reduced rates prompted investors to seek alternative sources of income. This demand intensified even more after 2020, as the world grappled with the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in an even lower-rate landscape."", 'Based on data from S&P Dow Jones Indices covering the time span between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, it was found that during market downturns, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats showed stronger performance compared to both the S&P Composite 1500 and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index. Specifically, on average, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outpaced the S&P Composite 1500 by 140 basis points (bps) per month and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index by 49 basis points per month during these periods of market decline.', 'The rationale behind these returns might seem straightforward. Dividend growers, by their very nature, showcase financial stability and confidence in their business. Their consistent increases in dividends send a positive signal to investors, reflecting strong financial health and a belief in future growth.

According to a report by RMB Capital, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 9.62% return from 1972 to 2018, compared with a negative 0.79% return for dividend cutters and eliminators. The report also mentioned that companies that consistently increase their dividends have demonstrated a remarkable ability to not just maintain but actually boost their dividends, even in challenging market conditions.

Second quarter total revenue grew 9.3% to $2.38 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. Our momentum in the business is good and volume remains robust. We can grow in a number of different ways. Contribution to our growth from new business remained strong and comes from companies that either outsource their program today or they are managing it themselves. We continue to have great success cross-selling to existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels, and our value proposition of image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance continues to resonate across businesses of all sizes and in all verticals.', 'We continue to be pleased with the results from our focus on prospects within the verticals of healthcare, hospitality, education, and state and local government. We recently announced the opening of two cleanroom facilities, one in North Carolina and the other in Wisconsin.

The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the second quarter grew 11.6% and operating income grew 12.3%.

Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter grew 17.8% over the prior year.', ""Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital.

Mike?', 'Mike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 second quarter revenue was $2.38 billion compared to $2.1 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 9%. Organic growth by business was 7.9% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 12.7% for First Aid and Safety Services, 17.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 4.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.02 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 48% for the second quarter of fiscal ‘24 compared to 47% last year, an increase of 100 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin.', 'Gross margin percentage by business was 47.4% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 54.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.6% for Fire Protection Services, and 40.9% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 40 basis points from last year. We continue to leverage our strong revenue growth and extract inefficiencies out of the business in order to expand margins. Our year-over-year improvements are no accident. Our Six Sigma and Engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our equipment, labor, and energy. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide density to our existing routes.', 'While energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a tailwind of 40 basis points from last year, please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies just mentioned. As an example, our rental revenue grew organically at 7.9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure since last year. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 400 basis points from last year. Our revenue growth is strong and value -- our value proposition continues to resonate in this segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. Our mix of revenues continues to be healthy, including growing high margin recurring revenue products like AED rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak.', ""We continue to use technology like SmartTruck to optimize our routes and improve efficiencies. And our first aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributes to our improved margins. Selling and administrative expenses grew $64.4 million or 11.1% over last year. Strong revenue growth creates leverage, which allows us to invest in the business. We continue to invest in our people, adding selling resources, investing in our management trainee program to develop future leaders, and expanding our talent acquisition efforts. Operating income of $499.7 million compared to $444.9 million last year.

Net income for the second quarter was $374.6 million compared to $324.3 million last year. This year's second quarter diluted EPS of $3.61 compared to $3.12 last year, an increase of 15.7%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal ‘24 interest expense is expected to be $100 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal ‘23, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal ‘24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal ‘23."", ""The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal ‘24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal ‘23 compared to fiscal -- I'm sorry, fiscal ‘24 compared to fiscal ‘23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. I'll turn it back to Jared."", 'Jared Mattingley: Thanks, Mike. That concludes our prepared remarks.

On top of that, many high-yielding dividend stocks also offer compelling upside potential due to a dirt cheap price or built-in growth prospects.', ""LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: LYB), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son (NYSE: NTB) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors for their compelling combination of income and upside. That's why they firmly believe investors won't regret buying shares at their current prices."", ""Tyler Crowe (LyondellBasell Industries): Chemical and plastic manufacturing has, historically, been a good business for long-term-minded investors. It's a cyclical business, and its profitability can swing based on the price of feedstock, typically oil or natural gas. Still, global demand has grown steadily for decades as people around the world move up the socioeconomic ladder and, inevitably, use more plastic and other chemicals."", 'LyondellBasell has been in the chemical and plastics business for decades. It is the largest manufacturer of polypropylene and polyethylene in Europe, the No. 2 producer of those products in the U.S., and the No. 5 producer of olefins globally.', 'Two things stand out at LyondellBasell that make it a compelling high-yield investment. For one, its shareholder returns have been spectacular. It has grown its base dividend by 22% annually since 2011 and has paid multiple special dividends and bought back considerable amounts of its own stock.', 'The other intriguing element to LyondellBasell is its big push into circular plastic production. It has developed several innovative processes for breaking produced plastics back into base chemicals that can then be used for the production of new products. Management estimates its circular plastics will sell for higher prices than base plastics and have lower feedstock costs. Combined, the two should increase margins and profits.', 'Today, the stock yields about 5.2% with a modest balance sheet and some impressive prospects for growth in the next few years. That looks like a good combination for a reliable and growing dividend for several years to come.', 'Matt DiLallo (Realty Income): Realty Income has been an extremely reliable dividend payer over the years. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has increased its payout 123 times since its public market listing in 1994, including five times this year. That steady growth should continue, making it a no-brainer for income-seeking investors. ', 'The REIT already has a great head start on its 2024 growth plan. In October, it sealed a deal to buy fellow REIT Spirit Realty for $9.3 billion. The company expects that acquisition to close early next year. It should boost its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by over 2.5% per share in the coming year. That will put it more than halfway to its target of growing its FFO per share by 4% to 5% per year. ', 'Meanwhile, the combined company expects to produce over $800 million in excess free cash flow after paying its high-yielding dividend (recently around 5.4%). That cash and its elite balance sheet give it ample capital to invest in more income-producing properties. The REIT has been spreading its wings by expanding into new areas. For example, over the past several quarters, it has added data centers, gaming properties, consumer-centric medical facilities, and vertical farming investments to its portfolio. It has also continued its international expansion and added a credit investment platform. ', 'Shares of Realty Income have slumped more than 10% over the past year over concerns about rising interest rates. However, that headwind should fade in 2024, given the expectation that rates will begin to fall. The currently lower share price makes Realty Income look like even more of a no-brainer investment right now. It enables investors to lock in a higher-yielding dividend that should keep rising in the future. That income, along with its earnings growth, puts the REIT in a strong position to produce double-digit annualized total returns from here. ', ""Jason Hall (Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son): 2023 hasn't been a great year for banks. The banking collapses of the spring shook the confidence of many investors, while the ongoing pressures of higher interest rates on balance sheets has affected the bottom lines of a few. But one bank that's built well to profit in the current environment, and a future of rates higher than most have seen in decades, is N.T. Butterfield. Based in Bermuda, Butterfield operates there as well as the Cayman Islands, and the Channel Islands off the coast of the U.K. and Europe. Often considered tax havens, these locations are certainly favored by many of the global elite, and Butterfield has had a presence in these markets for well over a century."", ""Despite this long presence as a valued bank in its core markets, since its IPO in late 2016, it's been a bit of a middling investment. Shares are up only 31%, while its dividend-included returns are 88%; however, that lags the market by about more than 60 percentage points."", ""That's partly due to a pretty exuberant IPO debut price, as well as the 2023 banking crisis, but it's also a result of its relatively slow growth profile."", 'But that doesn\'t mean investors should avoid it. To the contrary, I think it\'s an absolute steal. Shares trade for less than 7 times trailing earnings, and the dividend yield is almost 5.5% at recent prices. Even its price-to-book value of just under 2 is cheap for this bank based on its incredible profitability. It has earned 26.5% return on equity over the past year, and a 1.72% return on assets. Compare that to JPMorgan Chase\'s 18.7% and 1.35%, respectively, and you should see why this is a ""back-up-the-armored-truck"" sort of bank worth buying.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

In terms of volume, the most widely extracted commodities globally include iron ore, coal, potash, and copper.

18,4c585776-6d32-3cd3-b6e8-50ba72faa694,FE,2023-12-24,Is This Unique Gold Investment the Perfect Inflation Hedge?,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4c585776-6d32-3cd3-b6e8-50ba72faa694/is-this-unique-gold.html,1703340180,STORY,"['GC=F', 'HG=F', 'SI=F', 'RGLD', 'FNV']","[""The global economy was thrown for a loop by the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in countries effectively shutting businesses down to slow the spread of the virus. As the global economy opened back up, demand skyrocketed and supply chains couldn't keep up. Given that backdrop, it shouldn't be too surprising that inflation has been heading higher. Fear about inflation, meanwhile, often results in investors looking for investments that can provide inflation protection. Gold has been a beneficiary. But what's the best way to add precious metals to your portfolio?"", 'There are no perfect investments. Everything comes with a trade-off. For example, safe income stocks often lack growth appeal. Or, in this case, buying a hard asset like a gold coin means you will only ever own that gold coin. But what does that gold bullion do for you? When inflation is raging gold prices often move higher because it is considered a store of wealth. Right now gold prices are near historical highs.', 'Essentially, gold is one of the oldest forms of currency. And many investors believe that owning this precious metal is a way to protect against the decline in value of fiat currency. Fiat currency is backed only by the governments that issue it while gold is, well, a real physical item. There are a few ways you can add precious metals to your portfolio.', ""The first is to actually buy bullion (like gold coins). Transaction fees are high, you need to store it safely, and, as noted, a gold coin will only ever be a gold coin. You can, instead, buy a gold-backed exchange-traded fund. That helps to keep costs down and relieves you of the need to store it. But the gold in the fund won't grow over time like a business could."", 'This is why many investors prefer owning precious metals miners. They sell gold and other metals, so their financial performance tends to track along with gold prices. But they can invest in their business and expand (by opening new mines, for example). While perhaps not the same as holding a gold coin in your hand, it is a balance between inflation protection and the growth potential that a gold coin lacks. But if that sounds good to you, then you should probably consider a fourth option -- streaming and royalty companies.', ""One of the big risks with a miner is that building and operating mines is expensive, complicated, and sometimes dangerous. When something goes wrong it can materially impact a miner's financial performance. Streaming and royalty companies reduce the risks investors have to face. Companies like Royal Gold (NASDAQ: RGLD), Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE: WPM), and Franco-Nevada (NYSE: FNV) don't actually operate any mines, but they do have direct exposure to precious metals."", ""Essentially, streaming and royalty companies provide miners cash for the right to buy precious metals in the future at advantageous prices. The miners often use the money they get to build mines, though sometimes it can go to other things, like strengthening their balance sheets. This cash infusion means that the miner doesn't have to issue shares or sell debt to raise capital. And often the gold and silver they promise to sell to Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada is actually a byproduct of another metal they are mining, like copper. So it isn't the main focus anyway. It is pretty close to a win/win deal."", ""What increases the attractiveness for investors here is that the upfront cash is all Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada are expected to put in (other than the need to buy the precious metals at reduced rates in the future, but that effectively ensures they will make a profit on the transaction). If costs rise, that's on the miner. The only real issue that will pass through to the streaming and royalty company is something that disrupts production, like a mine stoppage. Obviously the miner can't sell gold to anyone if there's no gold being produced. This is an issue for Franco-Nevada right now because one of its largest mines has stopped producing, leading to a deep downturn in the stock price relative to its peers. That could make it the best option for contrarian investors right now, but go in knowing that it could take a while for this situation to be resolved."", ""There's another important benefit. Because Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada are, essentially, investing in precious metals mines, they tend to have fairly well diversified portfolios. A miner might have just a few operating assets but streaming and royalty companies usually have dozens of investments, some operating and some in an earlier stage of development. For example, Royal Gold's portfolio contains 181 properties spread across 17 countries. That's more diversification than you would get from any miner."", ""Meanwhile, all three of these stocks pay dividends. Royal Gold and Franco-Nevada focus on providing a growing stream of income. Wheaton, on the other hand, has a variable dividend policy that is driven by the company's financial performance. So when precious metals prices are high investors will benefit more directly from the lofty commodity prices. That probably won't interest conservative income investors, but it might be attractive to more active investors specifically looking to gold as an inflation hedge. Essentially, if precious metals prices rise along with inflation, the dividend from Wheaton might just be on the rise, too."", 'Gold and silver are commodities and they can be volatile. It is probably best to view companies like Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada as diversification tools, making up a modest amount of your portfolio (maybe 5% or so). And it is important to highlight that some on Wall Street question the actual inflation hedging benefit of gold and silver. But that just makes owning a streaming company, which can actually grow its business, all the more interesting as an alternative to bullion.

In this article, we decided to focus on Salesforce's  ROE."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Salesforce is:', '4.5% = US$2.6b ÷ US$58b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.04 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""When you first look at it, Salesforce's ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 9.7% either. Hence, the flat earnings seen by Salesforce over the past five years could probably be the result of it having a lower ROE."", ""As a next step, we compared Salesforce's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 17% in the same period."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is CRM worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CRM is currently mispriced by the market."", ""Salesforce doesn't pay any dividend, which means that it is retaining all of its earnings. This makes us question why the company is retaining so much of its profits and still generating almost no growth? It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline."", ""On the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Salesforce can be open to many interpretations. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

But a consensus won't be reached until the index logs a new all-time high. Here's the good news: It only has to gain another 0.5% to get there."", ""With that in mind, history suggests 2024 is almost certain to be another positive year for the S&P 500, which would all but guarantee a new bull market by every definition. Here's why investors might want to welcome the new year with shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)."", 'Google was founded in 1998, and it came public in 2004 valued at $23 billion. It began trading under Alphabet in 2015 because the company had essentially become a conglomerate, following several acquisitions like YouTube and Waymo, and the important internal expansion into cloud computing.', 'Today, Alphabet is worth nearly $1.8 trillion, and that incredible value creation prompted management to execute two stock splits since 2014 to ensure its stock remained accessible to small investors. Those investors might be thankful this year, because Alphabet gained 60%, which is more than twice the return of the S&P 500 -- and 2024 could be another strong year.', ""Google search remains Alphabet's largest source of revenue. It struggled over the last 18 months with a challenging economic environment, but with interest rates poised to fall next year, businesses will likely ramp up their advertising spending once again. That could reignite Google's search revenue and drive growth for Alphabet overall."", 'But artificial intelligence (AI) has been another challenge. Alphabet entered 2023 on the back foot as Microsoft acquired a $10 billion stake in leading start-up OpenAI. Microsoft immediately integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and it threatened to change the way people find information on the internet -- prompting a chatbot and receiving direct answers is far more convenient than sifting through web pages.', ""But Alphabet rose to the occasion and launched its own chatbot called Bard. It also embedded AI into the traditional Google search experience, and users will now find the information they seek at the top of the search results without having to click through to any web pages. But December marked Alphabet's biggest leap forward in AI so far with the release of its new Gemini model."", ""Gemini's multimodal capabilities -- like creating and understanding text, images, videos, and computer code -- appear to outperform OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models, according to statistics released by Alphabet. It could be a game changer for the company, especially for Google Cloud because it faces fierce competition from the highly successful Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, and Amazon Web Services, which features a growing number of models."", ""But valuation might be the biggest story for Alphabet heading into the new year. The company is on track to deliver $5.74 in earnings per share for 2023, and based on its stock price of $140.42, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 24. That's a 17% discount to the Nasdaq-100 technology index, and it's also 32% cheaper than Microsoft's P/E of 36. I think Alphabet has the pedigree to trade alongside its AI rival, so investors might enjoy another year of strong upside in 2024."", 'Advanced Micro Devices was founded in 1969, and it went public in 1972. Its stock has since delivered a blockbuster gain of 24,150%, prompting management to execute six stock splits since 1978 to ensure it remains accessible to smaller investors. But it could be set for substantial gains going forward, too, as it races to catch its rival Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the race to develop AI data center chips.', ""AMD is one of the largest chip companies in the world. Its hardware powers some of the most popular consumer electronics, including the Sony PlayStation 5, which just crossed 50 million units sold. AMD's chips can also be found in the infotainment centers inside Tesla's electric vehicles. But the company's largest-ever opportunity will likely be in the data center."", 'Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says there is $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure that needs upgrading to support accelerated computing and AI. His company has a dominant share in that market thanks to its powerful H100 graphics processor (GPU) and the upcoming H200. But AMD is launching a challenge with its new lineup of data center chips designed for AI workloads, called the MI300.', ""It comes in a few configurations; the MI300X is a pure GPU, whereas the MI300A combines GPU and central processor (CPU) chips to create the world's first accelerated processing unit (APU) for data centers. AMD has already started shipping the MI300A to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for its new El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to be the most powerful in the world when it comes online next year."", ""In fact, 2024 could be the biggest year ever for AMD's data center segment, because it expects to exceed $2 billion in sales from GPUs alone."", 'AMD delivered a lackluster financial performance in 2023, as consumers spent less on computers and devices under the weight of high inflation and rising interest rates. But Wall Street is forecasting $3.73 in earnings per share in 2024, representing 40% growth at the bottom line. That would place AMD stock at a forward P/E ratio of 37.4, which is a premium to the current 29.6 P/E of the Nasdaq-100.', ""However, AMD estimates the market for its AI data center chips will grow to $400 billion by 2027, so next year's sales will barely scratch the surface of its opportunity. Paying a premium for AMD stock today might actually seem like a total bargain looking back on this moment a few years from now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

In its third quarter, revenue tripled from a year ago to $18.12 billion, and its margins expanded significantly, with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share jumping more than 12 times to $3.71. On a GAAP basis, its profit margin was 51% in the quarter, and the company expects an even bigger fourth quarter, targeting revenue of $20 billion and a modestly higher gross margin.', ""Nvidia is entering 2024 with a target on its back. It's proven the market for AI accelerators and GPUs, and now semiconductor rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are launching their own AI accelerators. Big tech companies like Amazon and Apple are also entering the fray, designing their own chips for things like machine learning and neural engines, and for training large language models."", ""However, despite increasing competition, there's a reason to bet on Nvidia's continued growth in 2024. There's still a significant shortage of AI chips as cloud infrastructure services, data centers, start-ups, and foundation models race to get ahold of the key infrastructure components to run new generative AI technology, which requires enormous computing power."", ""Companies including OpenAI, Oracle, Microsoft, and Alphabet have all complained about a shortage of AI chips, but that's expected to ease next year -- meaning Nvidia will face more competition for its H100 processors, which can cost more than $40,000."", ""However, Nvidia itself is betting on demand continuing to ramp up, with plans to triple production from 500,000 GPUs to at least 1.5 million next year. Increased competition could lower prices, but it's unclear if anyone can compete with Nvidia in performance."", ""Nvidia has maintained a lead in GPUs since it invented them in 1999, and it could do the same in the AI space. The company also benefits from entrenched relationships with cloud infrastructure services like Microsoft, Oracle, Alphabet, and Amazon, as well as key customers like Tesla and OpenAI, and it's built a powerful network of chips, software, and complementary products that will be difficult for rivals to match."", ""Prices for AI hardware could come down, but Nvidia seems likely to keep its reputation as the leader in AI performance.

Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start today with a brief update on the business highlights for the second quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Bob for a financial update, and then, of course, we'll take your questions."", 'We had solid results in the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year with particularly strong performance in the PEO, mid-market HCM, and retirement. Revenue for the first half was up 6% year-over-year and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 10%, double digits. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remained strong as business leaders continue to face a very challenging small and mid-sized business environment. The tight labor market and rising healthcare and benefits costs are forcing many to rethink their HR and benefit strategies, and they can turn to Paychex as a trusted business partner in these times. As we sit here today, the selling season for our mid-market HCM and our PEO teams are in their final phases, and our insurance open enrollment is underway.', ""All are going well and in-line with our expectations. Our pipelines for these solutions are strong and up from this time last year. In the small business market, selling season is just ramping up. We still have a critical third quarter to go both in terms of selling and delivering for our clients during year-end, but we are fully staffed and well positioned at this critical time of year. Our revenue retention remains above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients. Client retention has improved over last year and retention in our HR outsourcing solutions remains at record levels. I'd like to highlight the success specifically in our PEO business, which we've talked about on prior calls."", ""It has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first half of the fiscal year. We have seen a back -- a shift back towards the PEO offering, both outside and inside our client base. This shift in mix has a long-term positive impact on customer lifetime value in our business model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. We previously discussed actions we took to help the PEO recover after last year's challenges including: one, redesigning our health offerings; second, leveraging AI to revamp our sales and marketing models and to identify and attract high-value prospects; three, putting more focus on upgrading existing HCM and ASO clients to the PEO model; and finally, improved sales execution. As mentioned earlier, our insurance enrollment is underway and the tax rates are up after a challenging year last year."", ""I want to specifically thank and congratulate our PEO team for all the hard work and success the past year so far. The macro environment and labor environment continue to be challenging for small and mid-sized businesses. Our Small Business Employment Watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation, which is indicative of a stable macro environment and that the actions taken by the Fed are having their desired impact. While we haven't seen any normal signs of a recession in our data, we started to see some softening in seasonal hiring in the quarter, particularly in our large client segments, including our HR outsourcing businesses, many of which typically add seasonal employees at this time of the year. SMBs are still challenged with access to capital, the high cost of capital, inflation and macro uncertainty."", ""While we certainly don't see any signs of economic downturn, we are ready to take the required actions if such trends emerge. As one of the best operators in the business, we have demonstrated that we are able to respond and successfully navigate changes in the -- any economic environment.

The exciting transformation that is now occurring around generative AI opens up the opportunity for us to bring AI solutions to our employees, so they can be more effective and efficient and to our clients."", 'We are actively investing in GenAI in exploring how it can be used to improve efficiency and the customer experience and provide actual insights to us and our clients to help them succeed. Currently, recently we partnered with Visier, a global leader in people analytics and workforce solutions, to offer new benchmarking reports in AI-powered HR analytics solutions to our customers.

As we head into selling season in calendar year-end, I'm confident in our global Paychex team and that they will constantly deliver and consistently deliver for our clients. We remain driven to be the trusted partner for small and mid-sized businesses that deliver industry leading HCM technology and advisory solutions that help our clients succeed. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results in the quarter. Bob?"", ""Bob Schrader: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some level of risks. I'll refer you to our customary disclosures in our press release as well as our Investor Relations presentation that should be on our website. I will start by providing a summary of our second quarter financial results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $931 million that was primarily driven by growth in a number of our clients served across our suite of HCM solutions, price realization, an increased product penetration and growth in ancillary services."", ""PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $296 million that was driven primarily by higher revenue per client, including higher insurance revenues and average worksite employees. As John mentioned, our PEO saw continued momentum in sales activity and medical plan purchase volumes during the second quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $31 million that was primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $752 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and continued investments in sales, marketing and technology. Operating income increased 7% to $506 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 40.2%, that's a 50 basis point expansion over the prior-year period."", 'And both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.08 per share. I will now quickly touch on the results for the first six months of the year. Total revenue grew 6% to $2.5 billion. Management Solutions revenue in the first half of the year increased 5% to $1.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions was up 7% to $593 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 62% to $64 million. Our total expenses for the first half of the year were up 5% to $1.5 billion. And our operating margins for this first six months were 41%, and that was a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 10% to $2.24 and $2.23, respectively.', ""I'll take you through a quick overview of the company's financial position. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high quality cash flows and earnings. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was more than $1.4 billion and our total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of the end of November. Cash flow for operations for the six -- first six months of the year were $1 billion, and that's up 40% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily driven by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. Do want to call out, similar to last quarter, there were some timing differences there based on where the quarter ended, ended on a collection day, that's having higher operating cash flows, that's why you see the 40% level."", ""That will moderate as we move through the year. We returned a total of $811 million to shareholders during the first six months that includes $642 million of dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remains strong at 47%. I'll now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. We've raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter. For other measures, I will also provide some color on where we now expect to be within the ranges and certainly we can provide some more detail when we get into the Q&A. The outlook assumes the current macro and competitive environment, which had some uncertainty, particularly as it relates to future interest rate changes in the economy."", ""So, our current outlook is as follows: Management Solutions is unchanged with growth in the range of 5% to 6%, although we do anticipate it will now be at the low end of the range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, that's up from our previous guidance, which was 6% to 9% expectation. Interest on funds held for clients is not changed. We still expect that to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but we now expect it to be more in the middle of the range. I know last quarter, we thought that might be a bit stronger. We now expect the total revenue guidance to be more aligned with our original guidance of 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%."", ""Although we now anticipate that will probably be toward the upper end of that range. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and that's raised from our previous guidance of $30 million to $35 million. No change to the effective income tax rate. We still expect that to be between 24% and 25%. And then, adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. So, we raised that last quarter to 9% to 11% just based on what we're seeing. We expect that to be a bit stronger and we're raising that guidance to 10% to 11%. Now, I'm going to turn to the third quarter to give you a little color on the third quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth for the third quarter to be in the range of 5% to 6%, and operating margins to be in the range of 44% to 45%."", ""As it stands right now, we would expect to pretty much be in the middle of those two ranges. And I'd like to remind everyone that we've talked about this in the past that ERTC becomes a headwind in the back half of the year. If I go back and look over the last two-and-a-half years that we've been selling ERTC, Q3 of last year was the largest quarter that we had with ERTC. And so that's a bit more of a headwind in Q3 than Q4, but will be a headwind in the back half of the year. Of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We'll come back and update you again on the third quarter call. As I mentioned, our investor slides are posted on the website, so I'll refer you there for additional information. And with that, I will turn it back over to John."", 'John Gibson: Okay. Thank you, Bob. We will now open it up -- the call for questions.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed.

That's why when we briefly looked at PPG Industries' (NYSE:PPG) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business.

Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 13% and the business has deployed 28% more capital into its operations. 13% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that PPG Industries has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders."", 'To sum it up, PPG Industries has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return.

As a result, real estate stocks are a popular choice among investors.', 'Popular as the sector might be, many people have been pessimistic about the market’s current condition.

In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""Public Service Enterprise Group does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.30. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", 'Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt.

This relationship is grounded in the perception of gold as the ultimate safe-haven asset. Consequently, gold prices generally exhibit an inverse correlation with the U.S. dollar. Gold is often regarded as a key indicator of investor sentiment against the dollar.

Nonetheless, copper prices remain sideways and sit only 1.5% above where they stood at the start of 2023. An increase among all of its components helped the Copper Monthly Metals Index (MMI) invert to the upside, with a 4.3% increase from November to December.', 'By late November, Panama’s president ordered the shutdown of First Quantam’s Cobre Mine, which accounts for an estimated 1% of global copper supply, after it was deemed unconstitutional by Panama’s Supreme Court. Following growing protests sparked by environmental concerns and contention over First Quantum’s contract with the government, the mine was idled and international arbitration initiated. The contract in question gave the miner 20-year rights for the price of $375 million annually.', 'While estimates and forecasts have fluctuated throughout the year, by late November, the International Copper Study Group noted a narrow apparent surplus of 17,000 tons during the first 9 months of the year. Throughout 2024, the group also forecasted a surplus of roughly 467,000 tons, something seemingly in limbo should mining disruptions persist.', 'While since-resolved, the closure came alongside protests at Peru’s Las Bambas mine responsible for roughly 2% of global copper output. The mine is also the second-largest copper mine in the world. Although currently operational, the mine stands as a flashpoint for protesters in Peru concerned over its environmental impacts. Furthermore, lack of support to local communities continues to exasperate the issue. Las Bambas possesses a storied history of protests over recent years, which while quiet at the moment, remain a ongoing risk for mining supply.', 'While shuttered at the moment, the fate the Cobre Panama mine appears uncertain. There are three potential outcomes to its future:', 'The mine remains permanently closed', 'It becomes nationalized', 'A new contract, likely more favorable to Panama, is negotiated with First Quantum', 'The mine accounts for roughly 5% of Panama’s GDP, which suggests that a permanent closure would come at great expense to Panama’s economic outlook. Panama also faced obstacles throughout the year with the Panama Canal. Low water levels forced the country to restrict shipping traffic to under 60% of normal capacity. The combination of the two events forced Panama to lower its 2024 growth projection to 2.5% from 5%. It’s not yet known how badly this will impact current copper prices.', 'Much could change by H2, however. A presidential election looms in May, with copper mining at the heart of debates. Among the front runners, former President Ricardo Martinelli proposed a renegotiation with First Quantum with higher royalties, while another former President and current candidate Martin Torrijos firmly stated, “Panama said no to metal mining.”', 'Considering the economic implications of a mining halt, even if a candidate like Torrijos secures the presidency, they would certainly not be the first politician to mysteriously shift views following an election. Something similar occurred in China in the Fall of 2022, where ahead of Xi Jinping’s fifth term, he remained in staunch support of zero-COVID, a policy that quickly unraveled by the start of 2023.', 'Nonetheless, the closure is estimated to have cut copper mine supply by around 40,000 tons in 2023. If it remains closed through May, 2024 would see supply cut by an additional 160,000 tons. While that alone is not enough to shift the market from surplus to deficit, tighter supply, especially ahead of projected supply deficits in the coming years, would offer support to copper prices.', 'Positioning among investment funds appears to reflect the evolving outlook for the copper market. By late October, positioning stood steeply net short, suggesting an overall expectation of lower copper prices. Funds began to unravel those positions, as they returned net long during November, however, and continued to expand that delta through December.', 'In spite of this, total fund positions declined over recent months, which leaves many opting to sit out of the still uncertain market. While mine supply remains in limbo, the global economic outlook does as well. Key sectors, like EVs, which underpinned many demand forecasts in the coming years, face considerable setbacks.', 'Source: MetalMiner Insights', 'Meanwhile, as current copper prices inch closer toward the top of their currently sideways range, markets await the next moves from the Fed. The prospect of unraveling interest rates in 2024 has already placed downside pressure on the U.S. dollar index, which trades inversely to commodity prices. While it also remains sideways, the U.S. dollar index has started to near its support level. The index currently sits just beneath the 102 mark, similar to where it stood in August.

As the global economy opened back up, demand skyrocketed and supply chains couldn't keep up. Given that backdrop, it shouldn't be too surprising that inflation has been heading higher. Fear about inflation, meanwhile, often results in investors looking for investments that can provide inflation protection. Gold has been a beneficiary. But what's the best way to add precious metals to your portfolio?"", 'There are no perfect investments. Everything comes with a trade-off. For example, safe income stocks often lack growth appeal. Or, in this case, buying a hard asset like a gold coin means you will only ever own that gold coin. But what does that gold bullion do for you? When inflation is raging gold prices often move higher because it is considered a store of wealth. Right now gold prices are near historical highs.', 'Essentially, gold is one of the oldest forms of currency. And many investors believe that owning this precious metal is a way to protect against the decline in value of fiat currency. Fiat currency is backed only by the governments that issue it while gold is, well, a real physical item. There are a few ways you can add precious metals to your portfolio.', ""The first is to actually buy bullion (like gold coins). Transaction fees are high, you need to store it safely, and, as noted, a gold coin will only ever be a gold coin. You can, instead, buy a gold-backed exchange-traded fund. That helps to keep costs down and relieves you of the need to store it. But the gold in the fund won't grow over time like a business could."", 'This is why many investors prefer owning precious metals miners. They sell gold and other metals, so their financial performance tends to track along with gold prices. But they can invest in their business and expand (by opening new mines, for example). While perhaps not the same as holding a gold coin in your hand, it is a balance between inflation protection and the growth potential that a gold coin lacks. But if that sounds good to you, then you should probably consider a fourth option -- streaming and royalty companies.', ""One of the big risks with a miner is that building and operating mines is expensive, complicated, and sometimes dangerous. When something goes wrong it can materially impact a miner's financial performance. Streaming and royalty companies reduce the risks investors have to face. Companies like Royal Gold (NASDAQ: RGLD), Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE: WPM), and Franco-Nevada (NYSE: FNV) don't actually operate any mines, but they do have direct exposure to precious metals."", ""Essentially, streaming and royalty companies provide miners cash for the right to buy precious metals in the future at advantageous prices. The miners often use the money they get to build mines, though sometimes it can go to other things, like strengthening their balance sheets. This cash infusion means that the miner doesn't have to issue shares or sell debt to raise capital. And often the gold and silver they promise to sell to Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada is actually a byproduct of another metal they are mining, like copper. So it isn't the main focus anyway. It is pretty close to a win/win deal."", ""What increases the attractiveness for investors here is that the upfront cash is all Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada are expected to put in (other than the need to buy the precious metals at reduced rates in the future, but that effectively ensures they will make a profit on the transaction). If costs rise, that's on the miner. The only real issue that will pass through to the streaming and royalty company is something that disrupts production, like a mine stoppage. Obviously the miner can't sell gold to anyone if there's no gold being produced. This is an issue for Franco-Nevada right now because one of its largest mines has stopped producing, leading to a deep downturn in the stock price relative to its peers. That could make it the best option for contrarian investors right now, but go in knowing that it could take a while for this situation to be resolved."", ""There's another important benefit. Because Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada are, essentially, investing in precious metals mines, they tend to have fairly well diversified portfolios. A miner might have just a few operating assets but streaming and royalty companies usually have dozens of investments, some operating and some in an earlier stage of development. For example, Royal Gold's portfolio contains 181 properties spread across 17 countries. That's more diversification than you would get from any miner."", ""Meanwhile, all three of these stocks pay dividends. Royal Gold and Franco-Nevada focus on providing a growing stream of income. Wheaton, on the other hand, has a variable dividend policy that is driven by the company's financial performance. So when precious metals prices are high investors will benefit more directly from the lofty commodity prices. That probably won't interest conservative income investors, but it might be attractive to more active investors specifically looking to gold as an inflation hedge. Essentially, if precious metals prices rise along with inflation, the dividend from Wheaton might just be on the rise, too."", 'Gold and silver are commodities and they can be volatile. It is probably best to view companies like Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada as diversification tools, making up a modest amount of your portfolio (maybe 5% or so). And it is important to highlight that some on Wall Street question the actual inflation hedging benefit of gold and silver. But that just makes owning a streaming company, which can actually grow its business, all the more interesting as an alternative to bullion. Add in the reduced execution risk relative to a miner and Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada start to look increasingly compelling for investors that want to add precious metals to their portfolio mix.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Wheaton Precious Metals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Wheaton Precious Metals, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Wheaton Precious Metals wasn't one of them.

Nonetheless, copper prices remain sideways and sit only 1.5% above where they stood at the start of 2023. An increase among all of its components helped the Copper Monthly Metals Index (MMI) invert to the upside, with a 4.3% increase from November to December.', 'By late November, Panama’s president ordered the shutdown of First Quantam’s Cobre Mine, which accounts for an estimated 1% of global copper supply, after it was deemed unconstitutional by Panama’s Supreme Court. Following growing protests sparked by environmental concerns and contention over First Quantum’s contract with the government, the mine was idled and international arbitration initiated. The contract in question gave the miner 20-year rights for the price of $375 million annually.', 'While estimates and forecasts have fluctuated throughout the year, by late November, the International Copper Study Group noted a narrow apparent surplus of 17,000 tons during the first 9 months of the year. Throughout 2024, the group also forecasted a surplus of roughly 467,000 tons, something seemingly in limbo should mining disruptions persist.', 'While since-resolved, the closure came alongside protests at Peru’s Las Bambas mine responsible for roughly 2% of global copper output. The mine is also the second-largest copper mine in the world. Although currently operational, the mine stands as a flashpoint for protesters in Peru concerned over its environmental impacts. Furthermore, lack of support to local communities continues to exasperate the issue. Las Bambas possesses a storied history of protests over recent years, which while quiet at the moment, remain a ongoing risk for mining supply.', 'While shuttered at the moment, the fate the Cobre Panama mine appears uncertain. There are three potential outcomes to its future:', 'The mine remains permanently closed', 'It becomes nationalized', 'A new contract, likely more favorable to Panama, is negotiated with First Quantum', 'The mine accounts for roughly 5% of Panama’s GDP, which suggests that a permanent closure would come at great expense to Panama’s economic outlook. Panama also faced obstacles throughout the year with the Panama Canal. Low water levels forced the country to restrict shipping traffic to under 60% of normal capacity. The combination of the two events forced Panama to lower its 2024 growth projection to 2.5% from 5%. It’s not yet known how badly this will impact current copper prices.', 'Much could change by H2, however. A presidential election looms in May, with copper mining at the heart of debates. Among the front runners, former President Ricardo Martinelli proposed a renegotiation with First Quantum with higher royalties, while another former President and current candidate Martin Torrijos firmly stated, “Panama said no to metal mining.”', 'Considering the economic implications of a mining halt, even if a candidate like Torrijos secures the presidency, they would certainly not be the first politician to mysteriously shift views following an election. Something similar occurred in China in the Fall of 2022, where ahead of Xi Jinping’s fifth term, he remained in staunch support of zero-COVID, a policy that quickly unraveled by the start of 2023.', 'Nonetheless, the closure is estimated to have cut copper mine supply by around 40,000 tons in 2023. If it remains closed through May, 2024 would see supply cut by an additional 160,000 tons. While that alone is not enough to shift the market from surplus to deficit, tighter supply, especially ahead of projected supply deficits in the coming years, would offer support to copper prices.', 'Positioning among investment funds appears to reflect the evolving outlook for the copper market. By late October, positioning stood steeply net short, suggesting an overall expectation of lower copper prices. Funds began to unravel those positions, as they returned net long during November, however, and continued to expand that delta through December.', 'In spite of this, total fund positions declined over recent months, which leaves many opting to sit out of the still uncertain market. While mine supply remains in limbo, the global economic outlook does as well. Key sectors, like EVs, which underpinned many demand forecasts in the coming years, face considerable setbacks.', 'Source: MetalMiner Insights', 'Meanwhile, as current copper prices inch closer toward the top of their currently sideways range, markets await the next moves from the Fed. The prospect of unraveling interest rates in 2024 has already placed downside pressure on the U.S. dollar index, which trades inversely to commodity prices. While it also remains sideways, the U.S. dollar index has started to near its support level. The index currently sits just beneath the 102 mark, similar to where it stood in August.

As the global economy opened back up, demand skyrocketed and supply chains couldn't keep up. Given that backdrop, it shouldn't be too surprising that inflation has been heading higher. Fear about inflation, meanwhile, often results in investors looking for investments that can provide inflation protection. Gold has been a beneficiary. But what's the best way to add precious metals to your portfolio?"", 'There are no perfect investments. Everything comes with a trade-off. For example, safe income stocks often lack growth appeal. Or, in this case, buying a hard asset like a gold coin means you will only ever own that gold coin. But what does that gold bullion do for you? When inflation is raging gold prices often move higher because it is considered a store of wealth. Right now gold prices are near historical highs.', 'Essentially, gold is one of the oldest forms of currency. And many investors believe that owning this precious metal is a way to protect against the decline in value of fiat currency. Fiat currency is backed only by the governments that issue it while gold is, well, a real physical item. There are a few ways you can add precious metals to your portfolio.', ""The first is to actually buy bullion (like gold coins). Transaction fees are high, you need to store it safely, and, as noted, a gold coin will only ever be a gold coin. You can, instead, buy a gold-backed exchange-traded fund. That helps to keep costs down and relieves you of the need to store it. But the gold in the fund won't grow over time like a business could."", 'This is why many investors prefer owning precious metals miners. They sell gold and other metals, so their financial performance tends to track along with gold prices. But they can invest in their business and expand (by opening new mines, for example). While perhaps not the same as holding a gold coin in your hand, it is a balance between inflation protection and the growth potential that a gold coin lacks. But if that sounds good to you, then you should probably consider a fourth option -- streaming and royalty companies.', ""One of the big risks with a miner is that building and operating mines is expensive, complicated, and sometimes dangerous. When something goes wrong it can materially impact a miner's financial performance. Streaming and royalty companies reduce the risks investors have to face. Companies like Royal Gold (NASDAQ: RGLD), Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE: WPM), and Franco-Nevada (NYSE: FNV) don't actually operate any mines, but they do have direct exposure to precious metals."", ""Essentially, streaming and royalty companies provide miners cash for the right to buy precious metals in the future at advantageous prices. The miners often use the money they get to build mines, though sometimes it can go to other things, like strengthening their balance sheets. This cash infusion means that the miner doesn't have to issue shares or sell debt to raise capital. And often the gold and silver they promise to sell to Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada is actually a byproduct of another metal they are mining, like copper. So it isn't the main focus anyway. It is pretty close to a win/win deal."", ""What increases the attractiveness for investors here is that the upfront cash is all Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada are expected to put in (other than the need to buy the precious metals at reduced rates in the future, but that effectively ensures they will make a profit on the transaction). If costs rise, that's on the miner. The only real issue that will pass through to the streaming and royalty company is something that disrupts production, like a mine stoppage. Obviously the miner can't sell gold to anyone if there's no gold being produced. This is an issue for Franco-Nevada right now because one of its largest mines has stopped producing, leading to a deep downturn in the stock price relative to its peers. That could make it the best option for contrarian investors right now, but go in knowing that it could take a while for this situation to be resolved."", ""There's another important benefit. Because Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada are, essentially, investing in precious metals mines, they tend to have fairly well diversified portfolios. A miner might have just a few operating assets but streaming and royalty companies usually have dozens of investments, some operating and some in an earlier stage of development. For example, Royal Gold's portfolio contains 181 properties spread across 17 countries. That's more diversification than you would get from any miner."", ""Meanwhile, all three of these stocks pay dividends. Royal Gold and Franco-Nevada focus on providing a growing stream of income. Wheaton, on the other hand, has a variable dividend policy that is driven by the company's financial performance. So when precious metals prices are high investors will benefit more directly from the lofty commodity prices. That probably won't interest conservative income investors, but it might be attractive to more active investors specifically looking to gold as an inflation hedge. Essentially, if precious metals prices rise along with inflation, the dividend from Wheaton might just be on the rise, too."", 'Gold and silver are commodities and they can be volatile. It is probably best to view companies like Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada as diversification tools, making up a modest amount of your portfolio (maybe 5% or so). And it is important to highlight that some on Wall Street question the actual inflation hedging benefit of gold and silver. But that just makes owning a streaming company, which can actually grow its business, all the more interesting as an alternative to bullion. Add in the reduced execution risk relative to a miner and Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada start to look increasingly compelling for investors that want to add precious metals to their portfolio mix.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Wheaton Precious Metals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Wheaton Precious Metals, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Wheaton Precious Metals wasn't one of them.

For this purpose, the US Air Force (USAF) in 2014 launched a highly classified Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, which is estimated to cost about $16 billion between 2023 and 2028.

Saudi Arabia entered into a $30 billion deal with the US in 2011 to procure 84 F-15SA fighter jets from The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). The final delivery of these aircraft were delivered to the Saudi Royal Air Force in December 2020. According to CNN at the time of signing the contract, the Saudi order for fighters was projected to support more than 50,000 jobs across 44 states of the US.

The financial details of the deal are not public yet. Last year, Washington also approved the sale of F-15ID aircraft to Jakarta for a deal valued at $13.9 billion.', 'Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of European countries, especially those that are members of NATO, have increased their military expenditure and are spending heavily on the procurement of fighter jets from the US. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Finland’s defense expenditure rose 36% in 2022 compared to 2021. Arms procurement including that of F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) accounted for one-thirds of all military spending by Helsinki that year.', 'Late last year, Germany also announced that it was acquiring 35 F-35 fighter jets from the US for a deal valued at $8 billion.

These stocks are sought after for their track record of rewarding shareholders and are considered a cornerstone of a conservative and income-oriented investment strategy. Dividend growth stocks increasingly captivated market participants who are in pursuit of potential market outperformance and appealing yields. This trend gained momentum notably after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis when interest rates plummeted to historic lows. The subsequent environment of reduced rates prompted investors to seek alternative sources of income. This demand intensified even more after 2020, as the world grappled with the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in an even lower-rate landscape."", 'Based on data from S&P Dow Jones Indices covering the time span between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, it was found that during market downturns, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats showed stronger performance compared to both the S&P Composite 1500 and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index. Specifically, on average, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outpaced the S&P Composite 1500 by 140 basis points (bps) per month and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index by 49 basis points per month during these periods of market decline.', 'The rationale behind these returns might seem straightforward. Dividend growers, by their very nature, showcase financial stability and confidence in their business. Their consistent increases in dividends send a positive signal to investors, reflecting strong financial health and a belief in future growth.

According to a report by RMB Capital, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 9.62% return from 1972 to 2018, compared with a negative 0.79% return for dividend cutters and eliminators. The report also mentioned that companies that consistently increase their dividends have demonstrated a remarkable ability to not just maintain but actually boost their dividends, even in challenging market conditions.

This accounts for 18.3% of the country's Gross Domestic Product."", 'Becoming a doctor in the US involves substantial expenses, with individuals often facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans. In February 2022, Forbes reported that the expenses associated with attending medical school can be equivalent to the price of a house. Data provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) indicated that the median four-year cost of attendance for the Class of 2020 fell between $255,000 to $337,000.

Therefore, reducing healthcare spending in the US requires a nuanced approach. It involves addressing the high costs associated with medical education while exploring strategies to retain and support domestically trained healthcare professionals.

In the United States, work is already underway to develop a sixth-generation fighter jet by 2030 to replace Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-22 Raptor. For this purpose, the US Air Force (USAF) in 2014 launched a highly classified Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, which is estimated to cost about $16 billion between 2023 and 2028. The USAF has requested $1.7 billion for NGAD in its FY24 budget request.', 'In August 2022, five companies received contracts of $975 million each to work on the NGAD program for a period of ten years.

Several countries in the Middle East have increased their defense spending over the past couple of decades. Saudi Arabia entered into a $30 billion deal with the US in 2011 to procure 84 F-15SA fighter jets from The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). The final delivery of these aircraft were delivered to the Saudi Royal Air Force in December 2020. According to CNN at the time of signing the contract, the Saudi order for fighters was projected to support more than 50,000 jobs across 44 states of the US. The UAE’s air force is also equipped with 80 F-16 fighter jets, as part of a $6.4 billion deal it signed with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in 2000.', 'Other countries in Asia are also racking up their air force capabilities, with the help of American aerospace companies. During Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington in June 2023, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) announced that it had signed an agreement with India’s state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. to produce fighter jet engines for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The signed contract mentioned the likelihood of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)’s F414 engines being jointly produced for use by IAF’s Tejas fighter jets.', 'This August, the Indonesian Air Force said it had signed a memorandum of agreement with The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) for purchasing 24 F-15EX fighter jets, which is the most advanced version of the F-15. The financial details of the deal are not public yet. Last year, Washington also approved the sale of F-15ID aircraft to Jakarta for a deal valued at $13.9 billion.', 'Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of European countries, especially those that are members of NATO, have increased their military expenditure and are spending heavily on the procurement of fighter jets from the US. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Finland’s defense expenditure rose 36% in 2022 compared to 2021. Arms procurement including that of F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) accounted for one-thirds of all military spending by Helsinki that year.', 'Late last year, Germany also announced that it was acquiring 35 F-35 fighter jets from the US for a deal valued at $8 billion.

Crystals key to making semiconductor chips can be synthesised with higher purity in orbit.', 'Josh Western, Space Forge’s founder, says: “A combination of the microgravity and the vacuum you find in space allows you to create incredibly pure crystal structures. Space effectively allows crystals to bond better with less contaminants.”', 'While most chips are made of silicon, Space Forge is exploring the use of alternative materials such as gallium nitride. The full chip won’t be made in space, just the raw material.', 'Higher crystal\xa0purity means chips will produce less waste heat, which could save millions of pounds when operated. The amount of energy use could be slashed\xa0by up to 60pc.', 'As more of the economy turns to electric power in an effort to lower carbon emissions, making high-quality chips can deliver significant benefits.', 'Western hopes the technology will lead to significant savings for applications such as 5G phone masts, radar and electric car charging.', '“Some of the chips in a 5G tower only run at about 8pc efficiency,” he says. “Replacing those chips with space-made ones you can treble the efficiency in those applications.”', 'Vastly more computing power is also being put to use around the world, from developing artificial intelligence to modelling the weather, climate and conducting pharmaceutical research.', 'Last month Cardiff-headquartered Space Forge was awarded £499,000 by the Ministry of Defence as part of a project with US defence firm Northrop Grumman.', 'The company’s lab can be launched by rockets such as those operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Once the process of forming the crystals is complete, the aim is for the module to be returned to earth “like Mary Poppins” with a deployable umbrella to slow its reentry, Western says.', 'The cost will be significant but the final price will depend on the complexity of the chip materials, how long the module stays in space and how many microchips a customer wants.', 'For short runs, “the value of the materials we’re looking at range anywhere from low hundreds of thousands of dollars per kilogramme all the way up to multiple tens of millions depending on how complex that structure is that you need,” Western says.', 'Once a batch of chips have been made in space, the material can be used to “seed” cheaper manufacturing processes on earth. This lowers the cost of production dramatically while retaining most of the benefits.', 'Space Forge isn’t alone in exploring ways to manufacture in space.', 'California-based Varda Space Industries hopes to make pharmaceuticals in space, again making use of the low gravity. It launched a 300kg test craft in June.', 'The craft contained a mini-factory to make an AIDS drug called Ritonavir with the aim of creating a more stable version.', 'At its most basic, the process involves “mixing fluids together, mixing powders plus fluids, heating, cooling them, and stirring them” in what is effectively a “miniature drug kitchen” in space, says Delian Asparouhov, Varda’s co-founder and a partner at Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.', 'No gravity means “you can heat two molecules up and they stay where they are very precisely, and then they combine exactly how you want them to”.', 'For making complex, expensive drugs for cancer patients and pain management, this is very important, he adds.', 'The pristine environment of space means that drugs can be made with very dependable characteristics. Products made in space could eventually cost as little as $60 (£47) a gramme, Asparouhov predicts.', 'Temperature readings sent to earth suggest the process on Varda’s test craft was a success, although the final result will only be clear when scientists can prise open the module.', '“We know that the oven went through the right temperatures, we don’t know what the cake looks like inside. We know it’s probably baked well, but at the end of the day, you gotta be able to actually open it and look at it.”', 'However, Varda’s novel manufacturing method faces an unusual hurdle. Its space module, and the drugs onboard, need permission for re-entry from the US Federal Aviation Administration and the US air force. Permission was denied earlier in the year and the module remains in space.', 'Dealing with a number of regulators has proved a headache, says Asparouhov.', '“This stuff is all written down in the United States on paper, in theory, but we’re the first ones to actually go through this type of regulatory process. And it turns out, there’s just, you know, hiccups.”', 'The company hopes to retrieve the module early next year, likely touching down in Australia or Utah where there are large expanses of uninhabited land that a satellite can safely land on.', 'Beyond drugs and computer chips, there are a raft of other opportunities for manufacturing in space, says Tommaso Ghidini, head of the mechanical department of the European Space Agency.', '“In the past, we were remaining in space with human beings for a very limited amount of time. Now, that time is increasing quite significantly.”', 'Ambitions for humans to eventually reach Mars creates opportunities for Moon-based manufacturing to supply missions en route. If humans do reach Mars, they will also need to be able to make things there.', 'Longer time in space means you need more tools to fix things if they go wrong. The answer to this will be 3D printing both in plastics and metals, says Ghidini - there’s no point sending spares to space you don’t need.', 'It will mean developing clever manufacturing techniques that use less power and can work with materials at hand, recycling metals on the moon as bases are built there.', '“Everything that you launch to the space station costs a significant amount of money, but things fail,” he says.', '“On Mars, you cannot ship every possible tool or you cannot bring with you every possible thing that may be failing or maybe not, it’s much more effective to have a 3D printer with you.”', 'Luckily the rocks that litter the moon’s surface have a trove of raw materials including aluminium, silicon, iron, titanium, magnesium, calcium, and oxygen.', 'Making use of them is the next challenge.', 'Ghidini says: “Imagine having a workshop or a manufacturing plant on Earth. Imagine how much equipment you have there, how many processes you have to do before you have a final product.”', 'The ideas may sound outlandish but those involved insist results will be seen in years, not decades. Space Forge and Northrop Grumman expect to take custody of space-made materials as soon as 2025.', '“The opportunities are massive,” says David Pile, regional director for Northrop Grumman.', 'The sky, it seems, is no longer the limit.', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

In the United States, work is already underway to develop a sixth-generation fighter jet by 2030 to replace Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-22 Raptor. For this purpose, the US Air Force (USAF) in 2014 launched a highly classified Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, which is estimated to cost about $16 billion between 2023 and 2028. The USAF has requested $1.7 billion for NGAD in its FY24 budget request.', 'In August 2022, five companies received contracts of $975 million each to work on the NGAD program for a period of ten years. These included Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).', 'Given the level of research being carried out on the development of the future fighter jet in the US, and the fact that much of the world relies on US-based aerospace companies for the procurement of their fighters and other aircraft, it is safe to say that America is likely to retain its status as the global military power for the foreseeable future.', 'This also bodes well for the US economy. Several countries in the Middle East have increased their defense spending over the past couple of decades. Saudi Arabia entered into a $30 billion deal with the US in 2011 to procure 84 F-15SA fighter jets from The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). The final delivery of these aircraft were delivered to the Saudi Royal Air Force in December 2020. According to CNN at the time of signing the contract, the Saudi order for fighters was projected to support more than 50,000 jobs across 44 states of the US. The UAE’s air force is also equipped with 80 F-16 fighter jets, as part of a $6.4 billion deal it signed with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in 2000.', 'Other countries in Asia are also racking up their air force capabilities, with the help of American aerospace companies. During Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington in June 2023, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) announced that it had signed an agreement with India’s state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. to produce fighter jet engines for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The signed contract mentioned the likelihood of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)’s F414 engines being jointly produced for use by IAF’s Tejas fighter jets.', 'This August, the Indonesian Air Force said it had signed a memorandum of agreement with The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) for purchasing 24 F-15EX fighter jets, which is the most advanced version of the F-15. The financial details of the deal are not public yet. Last year, Washington also approved the sale of F-15ID aircraft to Jakarta for a deal valued at $13.9 billion.', 'Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of European countries, especially those that are members of NATO, have increased their military expenditure and are spending heavily on the procurement of fighter jets from the US. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Finland’s defense expenditure rose 36% in 2022 compared to 2021. Arms procurement including that of F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) accounted for one-thirds of all military spending by Helsinki that year.', 'Late last year, Germany also announced that it was acquiring 35 F-35 fighter jets from the US for a deal valued at $8 billion. The cost will be paid out of a $14 billion fund that German lawmakers approved earlier in the year to upgrade and enhance military capabilities in wake of Moscow’s aggression against Kyiv in the neighborhood.', 'Pixabay/Public Domain', 'The 20 Largest Air Forces In The World Heading into 2024 are ranked in ascending order of the air force fleet size of countries.

Again and again it's NIKE that pushes what's possible to break the status quo."", ""Now in addition to creating best-in-class innovation, great companies must also focus on strong execution. And that's what we did in Q2, delivering our second $13 billion quarter. This one on top of last year's extraordinary 27% growth and we drove more than 20% growth in earnings per share this quarter. Simply put, this is the result of relentless execution by our team in an uneven macro backdrop. Looking at holiday, we outpaced the industry, driving growth of close to 10%. NIKE Digital had its strongest Black Friday week ever and a record number of consumers shopped in our stores over the long Thanksgiving weekend. And in Greater China, brick-and-mortar grew double-digits during National Day holiday and NIKE once again outperformed the industry during Double Eleven is the number one sport brand on Tmall."", ""These holiday results when combined with Q2's earnings growth and our continued healthy inventory, showcase how we're executing against our priorities even in the face of a highly promotional environment and increasing macro volatility. Last quarter, I talked about how we're getting back on our front foot, accelerating the flow of our innovation and executing with excellence across our winning formula of innovative product times distinctive storytelling times differentiated marketplace experiences. Let me give you a few examples of where we demonstrated progress. Within our running business, we are driving deeper connections with the running community. We recently launched our most innovative trail shoe yet, the Ultrafly at the world's Pinnacle trail race."", ""We hosted over 1,000 runners for uniquely NIKE experience which drove energy and positive feedback from both elite runners and the broader trail running community. And we partnered with top RSG doors for a series of community activations centered on the Ultrafly and other key products like Peg Trail and WildHorse. All this led to growth of over 20% in our trail running portfolio for the quarter. In global football, we're fueling growth through strategic only NIKE athlete storytelling. As you know, we have a three-silo construct in men's football, having paired Erling Haaland with a Phantom boot, Jamal Musiala with the Tiempo, and Kylian Mbappe and Marcus Rashford leading the Mercurial. With the game's greatest showcasing our product superiority and our seamless execution to pull this innovation through the marketplace, all three franchises are up strong double-digits even lapping last year's strong performance with the Men's World Cup."", ""And in lifestyle, we're driving a women's led geo by geo marketing acceleration behind V2K, a standout shoe in our fast-growing retro running line. It's being fueled by a tongue-in-cheek campaign that's resonated with this consumer and a creator partnership strategy that's delivered head to toe style inspiration into her preferred media channels. All this catalyzed the V2K to very strong sell through in the quarter with exciting potential for this style still to come. All three of these examples offer an early indication of the growth we aspire to. We have real opportunity to drive progress across many dimensions of our business and that's our priority moving forward. At NIKE, we'd like to say we're on the offense always. When we see something that needs solving, we don't wait around, we solve it."", ""And so, as we look to the future, we know where we must focus. Three areas will always drive our distinction and competitive separation. Product innovation, storytelling that connects and marketplace execution. When NIKE's at its best, we create impact on a scale that can't be matched, routed in sport, centered in youth culture, inviting consumers around the world into our brands. The second half of fiscal '24 represents the start of a multi-year product innovation cycle that will introduce new franchises concepts and platforms, elevating our full portfolio. And while there'll be some key moments in the second half, this new innovation cycle will take some time to fully ramp up, given our size and scale. Now, we know we have an outsized opportunity to drive long-term profitable growth."", ""And we have areas of significant growth potential like Women's Jordan brand and running, each of which requires focused investment to reach full potential. We also must get deeper traction on our key speed initiatives. Today, we know we must be faster, increasing the pace of innovation, increasing the pace of market to consumer and increasing our agility and responsiveness. To drive this, we will embrace a significant savings plan to create investment capacity to fuel profitable growth at speed and scale. Areas of potential savings include simplifying our product portfolio, increasing automation and the use of technology, streamlining our organization and leveraging our scale to drive greater efficiency. Let me just acknowledge that this work will be led with respect and thoughtfulness as we move to improve the ways in which we work and build a leaner and stronger company for the future."", ""Matt will provide more detail on this later in the call. Now, we've made some progress as we look to accelerate growth in our business. And I want to walk through two key areas today where we're investing for future and further growth. Our Women's business and Jordan brands. Both Women's and Jordan are opportunities that are grounded in performance and the ability to drive culture and lifestyle, with the latter providing even greater scale and growth opportunities. First, let's discuss Women's which is already a roughly $9 billion business and that's just the NIKE brand excluding Jordan and Converse. Our Women's business has grown high single digits on average over the past three years. And while we are encouraged by this progress, we now have line-of-sight into what we believe is the best plan we've ever had to accelerate growth in Women's."", ""Our plan makes us even more confident in serving her through sport and style. Today, about 40% of our members are women consumers. They make up a bigger proportion of new members and their demand per member is growing faster. We see great opportunity to better serve this consumer by responding to her needs across the spectrum of performance and lifestyle. Let me first touch on performance where we're focused on innovating for her to create new opportunities we did not previously served. We've now built a collection of bras and leggings across different price points. This includes our statement leggings, Zenvy, Go and Universa, all of which are above $100, our price point we were not previously in. These leggings serve her with a whole new approach to fit and comfort, thanks to new material innovation."", ""And we're holistically elevating our retail presentation and storytelling to help her find the right product for her exact needs. More and more women are joining our brand by purchasing these leggings. In fact all told, statement leggings fueled our fitness apparel growth in women's for the quarter. And in footwear, we're seeing very strong sell-through for the Motiva, a shoe with a comfortable and distinctive design. This shows how we dimensionalize performance and to walk in. And Free Metcon is also performing very well serving her need for versatility by expanding a fitness shoe into comfortable every day wear. And at the same time, when we look at women's lifestyle, we've established our leadership position in women's sportswear through a focus on style and comfort."", ""With iconic franchises like Air Force 1, Dunk, Court and Fleece, all of which drive continued momentum with new energy and design. And we're also fueling the rapidly growing retro running trend with our portfolio of styles like the Vomero 5, V2K and P-6000. In fact, even with that sequentially increasing the supply, demand for this entire line is so strong, there remains tremendous opportunity to grow further. We're excited to scale these styles over the next few seasons. And so today we're taking the right steps to serve our women consumer with energy and sharpness and we're fully aligned and accelerating our offense to raise our game with an eye to the immense opportunity we see going forward. Now let's discuss Jordan brand, which is on a clear path to become the number two footwear brand in North America, the biggest brand not named NIKE."", ""We're fueling the strong momentum in Jordan by growing a Monday to Friday business with a more diverse product portfolio on top of our very successful launch business. Over the past few years, we've driven strong growth in the Jordan business by bringing more dimensions into the brand. We're proving that Jordan can be more than retro, more than footwear, more than men's and more than North America. And approach to growth will continue to bring life and growth over the coming years. And this is just the beginning for Jordan brand as we see even greater growth potential through our plan for deeper investment, which for Jordan will come in areas like merchandising, marketing and marketplace. For instance, today, Jordan brand performance product is outpacing overall growth with Jordan reigniting it’s on core presence in basketball with the strongest signature portfolio ever as Tatum, Luka, and Zion pushed the brand to new heights, both on and off the court."", ""Jordan is also expanding beyond basketball into, for example, golf, global football and American football. And Jordan Women's and Kids continues to lead the brand's overall growth. Women's and kids' business share within Jordan have increased seven points over the past three years. And Jordan Apparel is now a roughly $1 billion business, averaging almost 20% growth over the past three years. We're also building new dimensions in the iconic AJ1 franchise across high, mid and low as well as through women's led dimensions such as the Elevate and the Brooklyn boot. And I'd also like to spotlight Jordan's strategic approach and success with our remix footwear line which again has already surpassed the $1 billion annual revenue mark with high double-digit growth, led by styles like the Max Aura and the Stadium 90."", ""Remix has increased Jordan's accessibility through more affordable price points and an expanded distribution with key partners. And last but not least, Jordan share from international markets continues to expand as we bring the brand to global cities in an authentic way. This is shown up as we pilot the Jordan destination tab in the NIKE commerce app in EMEA with strong early results and the Jordan World of Flight doors in Milan, Tokyo and Seoul have emerged as the company's most productive retail concepts. The sky is the limit for Jordan as we continue to invest and explore what's possible for one of the world's leading brands. In the end, we are moving with confidence against the opportunities we see. And looking ahead to the next calendar year, we remain single-minded in our focus to compete and win."", ""I wouldn't trade our position with anyone. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."", ""Matthew Friend: Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's second quarter financial performance reflected our proactive marketplace management and disciplined execution with tremendous delivery by our teams in a dynamic environment. Revenue was up slightly versus the prior year growing 1% on a reported basis as we compare to 17% reported and 27% currency-neutral revenue growth one year ago. Gross margins expanded despite a highly promotional marketplace. And combined with disciplined SG&A management, earnings per share and free cash flow accelerated. As I said last quarter, we believe we are turning the corner and driving more profitable and sustainable growth. At the same time, there were a number of puts and takes in the quarter."", ""So before I walk through our financial results, let me share some perspective on our performance in light of current macro and consumer trends as well as additional insight into our business direction. Now, as you recall, we moved proactively in the prior year to liquidate excess inventory and reduce wholesale sell-in for the first half of fiscal '24. And while this dampened our reported revenue growth through Q2, total retail sales in the quarter grew across the marketplace on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. ASPs were up across both footwear and apparel and AURs grew across channels. Average order values among NIKE members increased versus the prior year. Our higher-priced products, in particular, have been resilient with our $100 plus footwear models, driving strong growth in units sold across the marketplace."", ""And overall, we have maintained lower markdown rates than many of our competitors. In the most impactful consumer shopping moments, NIKE's brand strength created even greater separation. We delivered market-leading results in Greater China and Double Eleven. And over the Black Friday and Cyber Week period, NIKE Direct grew approximately 10% across North America, EMEA and APLA. In Q2, NIKE Direct once again led our growth and wholesale shipments exceeded our expectations. Having said that, we are seeing indications of more cautious consumer behavior around the world in an uneven macroenvironment. Total retail sales across the marketplace fell short of our expectations with softer demand outside of the key consumer moments. While NIKE's store traffic continued to grow, we saw softness in digital traffic and higher levels of promotional activity across the marketplace."", ""As a result, we are adjusting our channel growth plans for the remainder of the year. Looking to our product portfolio, our top franchises continue to drive strong full-price sales, but we intentionally manage the lifecycle of these models across the marketplace for long-term value. Given the promotional environment and the cautious consumer behavior that we're seeing, we are stepping up our plans to reduce marketplace supply of our key franchises. Our goal is to focus NIKE's brand heat and energy on what is new as we accelerate our product innovation cycle. We have seen encouraging signs from recent consumer activations around some of NIKE's latest innovations and newness and we intend to accelerate our pace through the Paris Olympics and beyond."", ""While this will initially take some time, we are confident in our pipeline and the product journeys, stories and consumer energy to come. Now, as you heard from John, our priority is to drive sustainable and profitable long-term growth while building a faster, more efficient NIKE. Since fiscal '19, our investments in accelerating NIKE's Consumer Direct vision, have created new operating capabilities, added tens of millions of new members to our member base and delivered a return of more than $12 billion of incremental revenue. However, we have also added complexity and inefficiency. In this competitive environment, we need to accelerate our pace of innovation, elevate our marketplace experiences, maximize the impact of our storytelling and increase our speed and responsiveness, all in service of the consumer."", ""To do this, we are creating investment capacity to fuel NIKE's next phase of innovation, growth and profitability. We are identifying opportunities across the company to deliver up to $2 billion in cumulative cost-savings over the next three years, both up and down our P&L and across our value chain. Some examples include simplifying our product assortment, improving supply-chain efficiency, leveraging our scale to lower the marginal cost of operations, increasing automation and speed from data and technology, streamlining our organizational structure, reducing management layers and enhancing our procurement capabilities. And as we look to drive greater efficiency and productivity, we will reallocate and invest the majority of these savings to deliver the greatest consumer impact on our largest growth opportunities."", ""Ultimately, we believe that building a faster and more efficient NIKE will accelerate future growth and innovation and deliver long-term profitability, creating value for years to come. We will continue sharing updates over the coming quarters. Now let me turn to our NIKE, Inc.'s second quarter results. In Q2, NIKE, Inc. revenue was up 1% on a reported basis and down 1% on a currency-neutral basis following our strong topline growth one year ago. NIKE Direct grew 4% with NIKE stores up 9% and NIKE Digital up 1% while wholesale declined 3%. Gross margins expanded 170 basis points to 44.6% on a reported basis, driven by strategic pricing actions, lower ocean freight rates, improved supply-chain efficiency and modest markdown improvements, partially offset by higher product input costs."", 'This included impact from approximately 60 basis points of unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A grew 1% on a reported basis, favorable to our expectations through disciplined expense management and some shifts in timing of spending. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.9% compared to 19.3% for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.03, up 21% year-over-year. NIKE inventory dollars are down 14% versus the prior year and down high-single-digits versus the prior quarter. In total, NIKE inventory dollars are down over $1.5 billion from the peak at the end of Q1 in the prior year with days in inventory continuing to improve. Total footwear and apparel inventory units across the marketplace are down double-digits versus the prior year.', ""Now let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue declined 3% with wholesale down 9% versus the prior year. NIKE Direct grew 3% with NIKE stores up 4% and NIKE Digital up 2%. EBIT grew 2% on a reported basis. This follows extraordinary growth in Q2 of fiscal '23 with North America revenue up 31%, NIKE Direct up 23%, NIKE Digital up 31% and wholesale up 37%. This quarter we saw mid-single-digit retail sales growth with key partners including Dick's Sporting Goods, JD Finish Line and Hibbett. Jordan and Women's led our momentum in the marketplace with Jordan Remix footwear grew double-digits and the AJ 11 Gratitude release delivered the brand's largest shock drop ever. Within Women's, Dunk, Free Metcon and our $100 plus statement leggings delivered strong growth."", ""In addition, Structure 25 and Vomero 17, our latest updates for everyday runners, drove positive response from consumers and running specialty partners. In EMEA, Q2 revenue declined 3% with wholesale down 8%. NIKE Direct was up 7% as NIKE stores grew 8% and NIKE Digital grew 7%. EBIT declined 6% on a reported basis. As a reminder, this also compares to tremendous growth in Q2 of fiscal '23 with EMEA revenue up 33%, NIKE Direct up 44%, NIKE Digital up 62% and wholesale up 28%. Against the backdrop of increased macro headwinds, we saw strong consumer response to newness and premium innovation. Our winterized running products drove positive sell-through along with strong growth from Invincible, Vaporfly and Ultrafly. Mercurial and Phantom and Tiempo grew double-digits."", 'And our retro running styles including V2K, P-6000 and Shocks continue to energize the marketplace. In Greater China, Q2 revenue grew 8% and wholesale grew 19%. NIKE Direct declined 4% with NIKE stores growing 16% and NIKE Digital declining 22%. EBIT grew 1% on a reported basis with multiple points of impact from foreign exchange. On the whole, we are seeing a highly promotional marketplace with increased macro headwinds, especially on Digital. That said, Q2 was another strong quarter in brick-and-mortar with continued improvement in full-price sales and sales in NIKE owned and partner doors growing mid-teens versus the prior year. We also continue to see strong momentum with key strategic partners, including Topsports and Pou Sheng. And NIKE continues to strengthen its lead as Chinese consumers number one cool and favorite brand.', ""Turning to our product portfolio, performance outpaced lifestyle this quarter with innovation and hyper-local storytelling resonating with consumers. We saw strong momentum in basketball, fitness, retro running footwear and winterized apparel. Locally inspired express lane collections including our street dance inspired Dunk and hyper-local Pegasus releases were top choices for consumers. And overall, our inventory remains healthy with units down and improved markdown rates versus the prior year. Looking ahead, we continue to closely monitor the operating environment. However, we remain confident in NIKE's brand strength, our deep consumer connections and our foundation for long-term growth in China. In APLA, Q2 revenue grew 10% and wholesale grew 7%."", ""NIKE Direct grew 15% as NIKE stores grew 17% and NIKE Digital grew 14%. EBIT grew 7% on a reported basis. Southeast Asia and India, Korea and Mexico grew double-digits, leading a record quarter for the geography. Our Flipkart and Myntra platforms drove strong growth in India. Korea led record member days sales in the geography. And Mexico accelerated its digital momentum over the Buen Fin shopping holiday. We saw strong momentum across our portfolio led by Jordan & Kids. Jordan brand delivered strong growth in Remix footwear, AJ1 essentials and Signature basketball. In kids, lifestyle and global football grew double-digits with positive momentum from all kids' Fleece, Court Borough and the Mercurial. All told, our team executed with tremendous focus and agility to deliver our Q2 results, while managing through volatility."", 'Last quarter, as I provided guidance, I highlighted a number of risks in our operating environment, including the effects of a stronger US dollar on foreign currency translation, consumer demand over the holiday season and our second half wholesale order books. Looking forward, the impact of these risks is becoming clear. And as a result, we are adjusting our full-year financial outlook. Looking through the balance of the year, we expect Q3 reported revenue to be slightly negative as we again compare to double-digit growth in the prior year and Q4 reported revenue to be up low-single digits with full-year reported revenue now growing approximately 1%. This new outlook reflects increased macro headwinds, particularly in Greater China and EMEA, adjusted digital growth plans based on recent digital traffic softness and higher marketplace promotions, lifecycle management of key product franchises and a stronger US dollar that has negatively impacted second half reported revenue versus 90 days ago.', 'I will also remind you that there are approximately 400 basis points of headwinds from supply disruptions and accelerated liquidation in the prior year. We expect increased gross margin expansion in our second half with Q3 margins expanding 160 to 180 basis points and Q4 margins expanding 225 to 250 basis points. We continue to expect full year gross margins to expand 140 to 160 basis points. This reflects benefits from strategic price increases, improved ocean freight rates and supply chain efficiency, partially offset by higher product input costs and approximately 60 basis points of impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We expect full year SG&A growth to improve to low-single digits, excluding restructuring charges as we continue to tightly manage expenses and improve productivity and efficiency.', 'Specifically, we expect SG&A dollars in both Q3 and Q4 to be modestly above our first half run-rate, excluding the charge. We anticipate a restructuring charge of $400 million to $450 million in our second half, primarily related to severance costs, which will be recognized largely in the third quarter. We expect full year SG&A including the restructuring charge to grow mid-single digits. We now expect other income and expense, including net interest income to be $275 million to $325 million for the full year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the high-teens range. Taken altogether, strong gross margin execution and disciplined cost controls are enabling us to offset softer second half revenue and drive earnings growth.', ""Excluding restructuring charges, we expect to deliver on our prior full-year earnings outlook. While we expect the operating environment to remain dynamic, we have been here before and we know that moments like this are when NIKE operates and execute at its best. We will stay on the offense, manage risk, optimize opportunity and leverage our strengths to create even further competitive separation. As we move forward, our focus is building a faster, more efficient NIKE and embracing the opportunities in front of us to accelerate sustainable and more profitable growth. So with that, let's open up the call for questions."", 'See also 20 Largest Air Forces in the World Heading into 2024 and 20 States that Drink the Most Wine.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

One area where IBM is seeing sustained demand is digital transformation projects that aim to deliver well-defined cost savings or productivity gains. The company's signings grew by 50% year over year in the third quarter, with signings involving cloud platforms like AWS doubling.

While IBM isn't immune to economic conditions, it's capable of growing during a range of scenarios."", 'IBM has been working on artificial intelligence for many years. When its Watson AI system won on Jeopardy! in 2011, it was a watershed moment for the AI industry. However, following that triumph, IBM struggled to commercialize its AI technology.

These stocks are sought after for their track record of rewarding shareholders and are considered a cornerstone of a conservative and income-oriented investment strategy. Dividend growth stocks increasingly captivated market participants who are in pursuit of potential market outperformance and appealing yields. This trend gained momentum notably after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis when interest rates plummeted to historic lows. The subsequent environment of reduced rates prompted investors to seek alternative sources of income. This demand intensified even more after 2020, as the world grappled with the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in an even lower-rate landscape."", 'Based on data from S&P Dow Jones Indices covering the time span between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, it was found that during market downturns, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats showed stronger performance compared to both the S&P Composite 1500 and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index. Specifically, on average, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outpaced the S&P Composite 1500 by 140 basis points (bps) per month and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index by 49 basis points per month during these periods of market decline.', 'The rationale behind these returns might seem straightforward. Dividend growers, by their very nature, showcase financial stability and confidence in their business. Their consistent increases in dividends send a positive signal to investors, reflecting strong financial health and a belief in future growth.

Conversely, companies that opt to cut their dividends typically do so as a measure to navigate financial challenges or uncertain times. According to a report by RMB Capital, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 9.62% return from 1972 to 2018, compared with a negative 0.79% return for dividend cutters and eliminators.

Some investors eliminate capital gains on paper by selling their unprofitable positions. You then have to avoid repurchasing that security for the next 30 days to ensure the capital loss makes it on your tax return.', 'Interestingly, you can sell a fund with one company for a loss and repurchase a similar fund without violating the wash sale rule.

While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Visa ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that Visa has managed to grow EPS by 20% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about."", ""It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth.

This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves."", ""You can't deny that Visa has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Visa's continuing strength.

This relationship is grounded in the perception of gold as the ultimate safe-haven asset. Consequently, gold prices generally exhibit an inverse correlation with the U.S. dollar. Gold is often regarded as a key indicator of investor sentiment against the dollar. Notably, in the week ending December 22, gold experienced a second consecutive rise, attributed to the decline in the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields, fueled by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will implement interest rate cuts early in the coming year."", 'The global mining market witnessed growth, increasing from $2022.6 billion in 2022 to $2145.15 billion in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%.

Nonetheless, copper prices remain sideways and sit only 1.5% above where they stood at the start of 2023. An increase among all of its components helped the Copper Monthly Metals Index (MMI) invert to the upside, with a 4.3% increase from November to December.', 'By late November, Panama’s president ordered the shutdown of First Quantam’s Cobre Mine, which accounts for an estimated 1% of global copper supply, after it was deemed unconstitutional by Panama’s Supreme Court. Following growing protests sparked by environmental concerns and contention over First Quantum’s contract with the government, the mine was idled and international arbitration initiated. The contract in question gave the miner 20-year rights for the price of $375 million annually.', 'While estimates and forecasts have fluctuated throughout the year, by late November, the International Copper Study Group noted a narrow apparent surplus of 17,000 tons during the first 9 months of the year. Throughout 2024, the group also forecasted a surplus of roughly 467,000 tons, something seemingly in limbo should mining disruptions persist.', 'While since-resolved, the closure came alongside protests at Peru’s Las Bambas mine responsible for roughly 2% of global copper output. The mine is also the second-largest copper mine in the world. Although currently operational, the mine stands as a flashpoint for protesters in Peru concerned over its environmental impacts. Furthermore, lack of support to local communities continues to exasperate the issue. Las Bambas possesses a storied history of protests over recent years, which while quiet at the moment, remain a ongoing risk for mining supply.', 'While shuttered at the moment, the fate the Cobre Panama mine appears uncertain. There are three potential outcomes to its future:', 'The mine remains permanently closed', 'It becomes nationalized', 'A new contract, likely more favorable to Panama, is negotiated with First Quantum', 'The mine accounts for roughly 5% of Panama’s GDP, which suggests that a permanent closure would come at great expense to Panama’s economic outlook. Panama also faced obstacles throughout the year with the Panama Canal. Low water levels forced the country to restrict shipping traffic to under 60% of normal capacity. The combination of the two events forced Panama to lower its 2024 growth projection to 2.5% from 5%. It’s not yet known how badly this will impact current copper prices.', 'Much could change by H2, however. A presidential election looms in May, with copper mining at the heart of debates. Among the front runners, former President Ricardo Martinelli proposed a renegotiation with First Quantum with higher royalties, while another former President and current candidate Martin Torrijos firmly stated, “Panama said no to metal mining.”', 'Considering the economic implications of a mining halt, even if a candidate like Torrijos secures the presidency, they would certainly not be the first politician to mysteriously shift views following an election. Something similar occurred in China in the Fall of 2022, where ahead of Xi Jinping’s fifth term, he remained in staunch support of zero-COVID, a policy that quickly unraveled by the start of 2023.', 'Nonetheless, the closure is estimated to have cut copper mine supply by around 40,000 tons in 2023. If it remains closed through May, 2024 would see supply cut by an additional 160,000 tons. While that alone is not enough to shift the market from surplus to deficit, tighter supply, especially ahead of projected supply deficits in the coming years, would offer support to copper prices.', 'Positioning among investment funds appears to reflect the evolving outlook for the copper market. By late October, positioning stood steeply net short, suggesting an overall expectation of lower copper prices. Funds began to unravel those positions, as they returned net long during November, however, and continued to expand that delta through December.', 'In spite of this, total fund positions declined over recent months, which leaves many opting to sit out of the still uncertain market. While mine supply remains in limbo, the global economic outlook does as well. Key sectors, like EVs, which underpinned many demand forecasts in the coming years, face considerable setbacks.', 'Source: MetalMiner Insights', 'Meanwhile, as current copper prices inch closer toward the top of their currently sideways range, markets await the next moves from the Fed. The prospect of unraveling interest rates in 2024 has already placed downside pressure on the U.S. dollar index, which trades inversely to commodity prices. While it also remains sideways, the U.S. dollar index has started to near its support level. The index currently sits just beneath the 102 mark, similar to where it stood in August.

As the global economy opened back up, demand skyrocketed and supply chains couldn't keep up. Given that backdrop, it shouldn't be too surprising that inflation has been heading higher. Fear about inflation, meanwhile, often results in investors looking for investments that can provide inflation protection. Gold has been a beneficiary. But what's the best way to add precious metals to your portfolio?"", 'There are no perfect investments. Everything comes with a trade-off. For example, safe income stocks often lack growth appeal. Or, in this case, buying a hard asset like a gold coin means you will only ever own that gold coin. But what does that gold bullion do for you? When inflation is raging gold prices often move higher because it is considered a store of wealth. Right now gold prices are near historical highs.', 'Essentially, gold is one of the oldest forms of currency. And many investors believe that owning this precious metal is a way to protect against the decline in value of fiat currency. Fiat currency is backed only by the governments that issue it while gold is, well, a real physical item. There are a few ways you can add precious metals to your portfolio.', ""The first is to actually buy bullion (like gold coins). Transaction fees are high, you need to store it safely, and, as noted, a gold coin will only ever be a gold coin. You can, instead, buy a gold-backed exchange-traded fund. That helps to keep costs down and relieves you of the need to store it. But the gold in the fund won't grow over time like a business could."", 'This is why many investors prefer owning precious metals miners. They sell gold and other metals, so their financial performance tends to track along with gold prices. But they can invest in their business and expand (by opening new mines, for example). While perhaps not the same as holding a gold coin in your hand, it is a balance between inflation protection and the growth potential that a gold coin lacks. But if that sounds good to you, then you should probably consider a fourth option -- streaming and royalty companies.', ""One of the big risks with a miner is that building and operating mines is expensive, complicated, and sometimes dangerous. When something goes wrong it can materially impact a miner's financial performance. Streaming and royalty companies reduce the risks investors have to face. Companies like Royal Gold (NASDAQ: RGLD), Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE: WPM), and Franco-Nevada (NYSE: FNV) don't actually operate any mines, but they do have direct exposure to precious metals."", ""Essentially, streaming and royalty companies provide miners cash for the right to buy precious metals in the future at advantageous prices. The miners often use the money they get to build mines, though sometimes it can go to other things, like strengthening their balance sheets. This cash infusion means that the miner doesn't have to issue shares or sell debt to raise capital. And often the gold and silver they promise to sell to Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada is actually a byproduct of another metal they are mining, like copper. So it isn't the main focus anyway. It is pretty close to a win/win deal."", ""What increases the attractiveness for investors here is that the upfront cash is all Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada are expected to put in (other than the need to buy the precious metals at reduced rates in the future, but that effectively ensures they will make a profit on the transaction). If costs rise, that's on the miner. The only real issue that will pass through to the streaming and royalty company is something that disrupts production, like a mine stoppage. Obviously the miner can't sell gold to anyone if there's no gold being produced. This is an issue for Franco-Nevada right now because one of its largest mines has stopped producing, leading to a deep downturn in the stock price relative to its peers. That could make it the best option for contrarian investors right now, but go in knowing that it could take a while for this situation to be resolved."", ""There's another important benefit. Because Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada are, essentially, investing in precious metals mines, they tend to have fairly well diversified portfolios. A miner might have just a few operating assets but streaming and royalty companies usually have dozens of investments, some operating and some in an earlier stage of development. For example, Royal Gold's portfolio contains 181 properties spread across 17 countries. That's more diversification than you would get from any miner."", ""Meanwhile, all three of these stocks pay dividends. Royal Gold and Franco-Nevada focus on providing a growing stream of income. Wheaton, on the other hand, has a variable dividend policy that is driven by the company's financial performance. So when precious metals prices are high investors will benefit more directly from the lofty commodity prices. That probably won't interest conservative income investors, but it might be attractive to more active investors specifically looking to gold as an inflation hedge. Essentially, if precious metals prices rise along with inflation, the dividend from Wheaton might just be on the rise, too."", 'Gold and silver are commodities and they can be volatile. It is probably best to view companies like Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada as diversification tools, making up a modest amount of your portfolio (maybe 5% or so). And it is important to highlight that some on Wall Street question the actual inflation hedging benefit of gold and silver. But that just makes owning a streaming company, which can actually grow its business, all the more interesting as an alternative to bullion. Add in the reduced execution risk relative to a miner and Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada start to look increasingly compelling for investors that want to add precious metals to their portfolio mix.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Wheaton Precious Metals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Wheaton Precious Metals, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Wheaton Precious Metals wasn't one of them.

There are far too many stocks that offer extraordinary yields of 6% or more -- a level that I'd categorize as ultra-high."", 'Granted, some of those stocks are too risky for many investors. But not all of them are problematic. Here are my four favorite ultra-high-yield dividend stocks to buy for 2024 (listed in alphabetical order).', 'Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) ranks as the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC). To be exempt from paying federal taxes, BDCs must return at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Ares Capital has generated a lot of earnings to return in this manner: Its dividend yield currently tops 9.8%.', 'Can Ares Capital sustain its dividend at such an ultra-high level? I think so. The company continues to generate strong earnings. It also has a great track record of 14+ years of stable to increasing dividends.', ""What I especially like about Ares Capital is that it has consistently delivered higher total returns than the S&P 500 over the long term. Middle-market companies' need for capital combined with Ares Capital's solid risk-management process should enable this stock to keep up its winning ways in the future."", 'Energy Transfer\'s (NYSE: ET) corporate tag line is ""moving America\'s energy."" That\'s exactly what the company does with its nearly 125,000 miles of pipeline. The limited partnership also moves quite a bit of money to its partners via quarterly distributions. Energy Transfer\'s distribution yield is over 9.1%.', 'Those distributions should continue to flow and grow. Energy Transfer expects to increase its distribution by between 3% and 5% per year. The midstream energy leader is generating more than enough cash flow to fund the distributions.', ""I'm not overly concerned that Energy Transfer's solid gains this year will prevent it from keeping the momentum going in the new year. The U.S. economy appears to be in good shape heading into 2024. Energy Transfer's valuation also remains attractive with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 8.3."", 'I also really like another midstream energy stock -- Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD). The company operates over 50,000 miles of pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, petrochemicals, and other refined products.', ""Enterprise's distribution yield currently stands just shy of 7.7%. What's really impressive, though, is that the company has increased its distribution for 25 consecutive years with a compound annual growth rate of 7%."", 'An additional big plus for Enterprise Products Partners is its consistency. The company has generated double-digit returns on invested capital (ROIC) and strong cash flow per unit during both boom and bust periods.', ""Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) is no doubt the best-known of these dividend stocks. It's a leader in the telecommunications industry with operations around the world. Verizon has also been a stock that income investors have loved for years. With the company's dividend yield of over 7.1%, income investors still love Verizon."", 'There are two main reasons why I included Verizon on the list of my four favorite ultra-high-yield dividend stocks. One is its track record of dividend increases. In September, Verizon announced its 17th consecutive year of dividend hikes.', ""The second is that the company's free cash flow continues to grow robustly, which should ensure those dividend increases keep coming. Just as important, this trend shows that Verizon can successfully navigate a challenging telecom market. I think this is an ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's built for the long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

There are very good reasons for this, as you'll learn below. But the company is expecting an incredible improvement in earnings in 2024. Assuming it can live up to this forecast, the stock could be in for a big rebound, too. Here's what you need to know."", 'During the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the tools that Stanley Black & Decker produces was quite strong. It makes sense: People stuck at home took on home improvement projects to enhance their living experience. Adjusted earnings in 2021 rose 30% versus 2020 and hit a record of $10.48 per share. As 2022 got underway, the company was projecting adjusted annual earnings to come in between $12.00 and $12.50 per share, which would have been yet another record result.', ""That didn't exactly play out as expected. Instead, Stanley Black & Decker posted adjusted earnings of $4.62 per share. That was more than a 50% decline. It isn't hard to understand why investors might have found that upsetting after the company set much higher expectations. Things have only gotten worse in 2023, with management now expecting full-year adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.40 per share. That would be another huge decline and helps explain the stock price malaise."", ""The backstory for this weak performance is equally as troubling. High leverage, slowing sales, and weak margins were all contributing factors. But Stanley Black & Decker has been working to get back on track by reducing leverage, cutting costs, and raising prices, among other things. The improvements are already starting to show up in the company's earnings."", ""Stanley Black & Decker is an industrial giant and you can't turn a ship like this around on a dime. It takes time, but slow and steady progress has been on clear display. For example, the company's adjusted gross margin has climbed each quarter since hitting a low point in Q4 2022. The improvement is huge, too, with adjusted gross margin rising from roughly 20% to 28%."", ""Meanwhile, the Dividend King (it has increased its dividend for 56 consecutive years) entered 2023 expecting adjusted earnings to be between zero and $2.00 per share. That's been narrowed to $1.10 to $1.40 per share, which tells you that the worst-case scenario didn't even come close to transpiring. Sure, the top end got lowered, but the real risk for investors was that the bottom fell out of the business, and that just didn't happen."", ""Meanwhile, looking out to 2024, Stanley Black & Decker has reiterated\xa0its earlier guidance for adjusted earnings of between $4.00 and $5.00 per share. That was a target used to justify the company's turnaround plans, so it would be reasonable to expect that management was being aggressive. But the business is well into that turnaround plan and it is still supporting the range, which is a very good sign."", 'So 2023 looks like it will be the nadir for earnings, which is worth noting. But the real takeaway is probably the improvement that will come about in 2024, if management can hit the targeted adjusted earnings range. Assuming the company can earn $1.40 per share in 2023, the high end of the projected range, adjusted earnings will increase by 285% in 2024 if it only hits the low end of expectations ($4.00). The high end -- $5.00 -- would lead to a 350% jump in adjusted earnings. Wall Street will likely change its view of Stanley Black & Decker in a very positive way if either of those scenarios plays out.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Stanley Black & Decker right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Stanley Black & Decker, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Stanley Black & Decker wasn't one of them.

Nvidia has parlayed that early success into a dominant share of the discrete desktop GPU space, recently controlling more than 80% of the market, according to Jon Peddie Research (via Tom's Hardware)."", ""Over the years, the secret to Nvidia's success has been its ability to adapt its technology to new and lucrative use cases. This all hinges on parallel processing, or the ability to break up massive computing jobs into smaller, more manageable pieces."", 'The company soon discovered that the ability to process a multitude of complex mathematical calculations could be used in other computationally demanding use cases. Nvidia quickly developed solutions for a wide range of these applications, including cloud computing, data centers, autonomous driving, and most recently AI. Furthermore, by relentlessly improving its technology and including software that makes its processors work even more efficiently, Nvidia created an economic moat that it maintains to this day.', ""The ability to pivot and constantly develop new use cases has helped fuel the stock's relentless climb higher, having gained 12,380% over the past 10 years.

Here's why."", ""In the realm of high-performance AI computing, efficiency is key. Pure performance doesn't really matter, because you can always throw more hardware at the number-crunching problem."", 'The supercomputers that train ChatGPT-style AI systems are equipped with thousands of Nvidia A100 accelerators with nearly 7,000 processing cores each. The real challenge is to supply enough power to run these beasts and then cool down the resulting space heater. The OpenAI/Nvidia system draws 7.4 megawatts at full power, comparable to a packed cruise ship crossing the seas or a large steel mill.', 'Therefore, the AI giants are really looking for a power-sipping solution that can deliver better results per watt.', ""Samsung and Naver's claim of an AI chip that is eight times more energy-efficient than Nvidia's H100 could represent a paradigm shift. In a world increasingly conscious of energy consumption and cost, a more efficient chip doesn't just mean lower power bills; it means a smaller carbon footprint, a more compact physical installation, and the ability to deploy more powerful AI systems without prohibitive energy costs."", ""Nvidia has long been the go-to provider for AI acceleration hardware, a fact reflected in its soaring stock price and market position.

And this time, Nvidia may not be the clear winner."", ""This development is not just a two-horse race. Companies like AMD and Intel are also in the fray, each with their own AI chip solutions. The AMD Instinct MI300 line comes with more memory and lower power requirements than the previous generation. Intel's Gaudi3 solution focuses on faster raw performance and a next-generation network tying the processors together. Everyone has a unique master plan."", ""But those alternatives never claimed to blow Nvidia's power efficiency out of the water. Samsung and Naver's focus on low power requirement could set a new standard, compelling others to follow suit -- but still giving the Korean duo a mighty first-mover advantage. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into various sectors, from healthcare to finance, the demand for efficient, powerful, and cost-effective AI computing will only grow."", ""This is all theory so far. Benchmark tests and real-world installation results will come in 2024 and beyond, as Nvidia's rivals crank out mass-market volumes of their new AI chips. Investors are left doing informed guesswork on how closely each company's claims will match the final performance, from power draws and raw number-crunching performance to next-level connectivity and other potential game-changer ideas."", ""Will Samsung and Naver's AI efficiency-centric chip deliver on its promises?

Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital."", ' Check out our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for C.H. Robinson Worldwide is:', '28% = US$390m ÷ US$1.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.28 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has a higher ROE than the average (15%) in the Logistics industry."", ""That is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for C.H. Robinson Worldwide."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", ""C.H. Robinson Worldwide does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.13. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", ""Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

These stocks are sought after for their track record of rewarding shareholders and are considered a cornerstone of a conservative and income-oriented investment strategy. Dividend growth stocks increasingly captivated market participants who are in pursuit of potential market outperformance and appealing yields. This trend gained momentum notably after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis when interest rates plummeted to historic lows. The subsequent environment of reduced rates prompted investors to seek alternative sources of income. This demand intensified even more after 2020, as the world grappled with the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in an even lower-rate landscape."", 'Based on data from S&P Dow Jones Indices covering the time span between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, it was found that during market downturns, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats showed stronger performance compared to both the S&P Composite 1500 and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index.

I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay."", ""Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. In fiscal Q1, Micron delivered revenue, gross margin, and EPS above the high-end of the guidance ranges we provided at the last earnings call, reflecting Micron's strong execution combined with improved pricing. We are in the very early stages of a multi-year growth phase catalyzed and driven by generative AI, and this disruptive technology will eventually transform every aspect of business and society. Memory is at the heart of GPU-enabled AI servers, and we are already seeing strong demand driven by early deployment of AI solutions, which will only accelerate over time. Micron is well positioned to leverage this growth, having executed the most robust set of new technology and product introductions in our 45-year history."", ""The improved supply-demand environment in the current calendar quarter gives us additional confidence in the trajectory of our business. We have driven a strong inflection in industry pricing this calendar quarter, which will allow us to benefit from higher prices earlier in our fiscal year compared to our prior plans. We intend to stay very disciplined with our supply and capacity investments as our pricing is still far from levels associated with necessary ROI. We expect our pricing to continue to strengthen through the course of calendar 2024. We expect improved margins and financial performance throughout 2024 and record industry TAM in calendar 2025. We have made significant progress with our industry-leading technology roadmap. Micron is at the forefront of ramping the industry's most advanced technology nodes in both DRAM and NAND."", 'The vast majority of our bits are on leading-edge nodes: 1-alpha and 1-beta in DRAM and 176-layer and 232-layer in NAND. As previously stated, both 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND nodes have reached mature yields faster than the prior nodes. We expect fiscal 2024 front-end cost reductions to track in line with our long-term expectations of mid- to high-single-digits in DRAM and low-teens in NAND. We are on track for volume production in 1-gamma DRAM using EUV in calendar 2025. Now turning to our end markets. Inventories for memory and storage are at or near normal levels for most customers across PC, mobile, auto, and industrial end markets. Consequently, the demand that we see from customers in these markets is closer to their end-market demand.', 'Data center customer inventory of memory and storage is improving, and we continue to expect customer inventory to approach normal levels in this market sometime in the first half of calendar 2024. Across our data center and PC markets, we are ahead of the industry in our transition to D5 and we expect to cross over our D5 volume from D4 in early calendar 2024. Generative AI use cases are expanding from the data center to the edge, with several recent announcements of AI-enabled PCs, smartphones with on-device AI capabilities, as well as embedded AI in the auto and industrial end markets. The proliferation of on-device AI at the edge offers a host of benefits such as enhanced privacy, lower latency, improved performance, greater personalization and competitive costs for a wide range of use cases, from content creation to productivity.', 'We see a rapid evolution in our customer product roadmaps enabling and leveraging this AI market expansion, which in turn is driving higher capacity, lower power, and increased performance requirements for memory and storage. We expect to increasingly benefit from content growth as these trends in AI gain momentum. In data center, total server unit shipments are expected to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024, following a year of low-double-digit percentage decline in calendar 2023. Demand for AI servers has been strong as data center infrastructure operators shift budgets from traditional servers to more content-rich AI servers. Also, in response to AI-driven data center demand, several customers have announced aggressive roadmaps for new GPU and AI accelerator ASIC product introductions with increasing requirements for HBM capacity, performance, and power.', ""Micron is addressing these exciting opportunities brought on by the proliferation of AI with an industry-leading portfolio of data center solutions, including HBM3E, D5, several types of high-capacity server memory modules, LPDRAM, and data center SSDs. We have received very positive customer feedback on our HBM3E, which has approximately 10% better performance and about 30% lower power consumption compared to competitive offerings of HBM3E. In fiscal Q1, we shipped samples of HBM3E to a number of key partners and are making good progress in our qualifications. Micron is in the final stages of qualifying our industry-leading HBM3E to be used in NVIDIA's next-generation Grace Hopper GH200 and H200 platforms. In addition, our LP5x is being used for the Grace CPU, driving a new use case for LP memory in the data center for accelerated computing."", ""We are on track to begin our HBM3E volume production ramp in early calendar 2024 and to generate several hundred millions of dollars of HBM revenue in fiscal 2024. We expect continued HBM revenue growth in 2025, and we continue to expect that our HBM market share will match our overall DRAM bit share some time in calendar 2025. Last month we introduced the industry's fastest and lowest latency 128GB high-capacity modules built on our industry-leading 1-beta node and using a monolithic die, which does not require 3D stacking and thus enables a simpler process flow for assembly. Featuring best-in-class performance, our solution will support customers' memory-intensive data center workloads today and into the future. Additionally, leading CPU vendors have confirmed validation support for our monolithic-die-based 128GB modules on existing platforms released in 2022 and 2023 as well as upcoming new platforms."", 'This ensures that our offering has a significant TAM that we can address immediately. We expect volume production to start next quarter, with significant growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond. A testament to our solid execution and superior offerings, Micron ended the third calendar quarter with record-high revenue share in data center SSDs based on independent industry assessments. This marks the second consecutive quarter of record revenue share in data center SSDs, and we look to build on this revenue momentum through fiscal 2024. In PCs, we forecast unit volumes to grow by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024, after two years of double-digit percentage PC unit volume declines. We expect PC OEMs to start ramping AI-on-device PCs in the second half of calendar 2024, with an additional capacity of 4GB to 8GB of DRAM per unit, and we see average SSD capacities increasing as well.', ""We also completed qualifications for our industry-leading 1-beta-based 16GB D5 at several PC customers in fiscal Q1. In fiscal Q1, we achieved record bit shipments in both client and consumer SSDs, as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Building upon our QLC leadership, our client SSD QLC bit shipments also reached a new record in fiscal Q1. QLC now comprises the majority of our bit shipment mix for both client and consumer SSD. This month, we also announced that we are shipping the Micron 3500 NVMe SSD, the world's first performance client SSD with 200 plus layer NAND. Built on our industry-leading 232-layer NAND, the 3500 will help our customers handle demanding workloads for business applications, scientific computing, gaming, and content creation."", 'In mobile, smartphone demand is showing signs of recovery, and we forecast smartphone unit shipments to grow modestly in calendar 2024. Leading chipset vendors have announced powerful new products supporting on-device large language models with 10 billion or more parameters. We expect smartphone OEMs to start ramping AI-enabled smartphones in 2024, with an additional capacity of 4GB to 8GB of DRAM per unit. Longer-term, many popular generative AI applications will be on smartphones, and our leading product portfolio is poised to capture this memory and storage opportunity. Our new industry-leading 9.6Gbps LP5x will address the bandwidth requirements of the most demanding AI-based mobile applications. We also began sampling our next-generation 232-layer NAND UFS 3.1 and our 1-beta DRAM 24Gb LP5x to support the memory needs of emerging AI foundational models.', ""Last, I'll cover auto and industrial, which are end markets we value as part of the portfolio due to their relatively more predictable revenue and profitability and long-term growth opportunity. The proliferation of AI at the edge continues to increase in the industrial and auto markets. For memory, this translates to content growth in a host of AI-enabled edge devices. For example, AI-enabled industrial PCs have 3x to 5x more memory than standard PCs and there is an 8x increase in memory content for AI-enabled edge video security cameras compared to standard non-AI video cameras. Our automotive business achieved a new quarterly revenue record in fiscal Q1, driven by better demand and volume ramps of new vehicle platforms. As a leader in automotive market share and quality, Micron will benefit from memory and storage content growth as automotive OEMs expand features in ADAS and in-cabin applications."", 'Our automotive design win trajectory remains strong. Our industrial business saw double-digit sequential growth in fiscal Q1 as the industrial market continued to recover. Inventory levels for memory and storage continued to improve at distribution partners and are at normal levels at the majority of our customers. Industry fundamentals remain strong for memory and storage as the widespread adoption of IoT, AI, and machine learning solutions creates new growth opportunities for us. Now turning to our market outlook, starting with demand. We expect calendar 2023 DRAM bit demand to grow in the high-single-digit percentage range, up from prior expectations for mid-single-digit growth. In NAND, we continue to expect calendar 2023 bit demand growth in the high-teens percentage range.', ""Looking forward, over the next few years, we expect bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-teens in DRAM and low-20s percentage range in NAND. We forecast calendar 2024 bit demand growth for the industry to be near the long-term CAGR for DRAM and somewhat below the long-term CAGR for NAND. Turning to supply, significant supply reductions across the industry have enabled the recovery that is now underway. An extended period of supply growth less than demand growth would strengthen the pace of recovery. Micron will continue to exercise supply and CapEx discipline, aligned with our strategy to maintain our long-term bit market share for DRAM and NAND. Micron's fiscal 2024 CapEx is projected to be between $7.5 billion and $8 billion, slightly higher than last year's levels and prior plans, primarily to support the HBM3E production ramp."", ""We continue to expect WFE CapEx in fiscal 2024 to be down year-over-year. As we have discussed previously, the ramp of HBM production will constrain supply growth in non-HBM products and will help improve the overall DRAM industry supply-demand balance. Across the industry, the HBM3E die is roughly twice the size of equivalent capacity D5. Additionally, the HBM product includes a logic interface die and has a substantially more complex packaging stack that impacts yields. These factors result in HBM consuming more than 2 times the wafer supply as D5 to produce a given number of bits. In last quarter's earnings call, we communicated that we strategically diverted underutilized equipment toward ramping new technology nodes, which will help us increase leading-edge production in a capital-efficient manner."", ""Since the number of wafer processing steps is higher for leading-edge nodes, this approach of diverting underutilized tools to the leading edge meaningfully reduces our overall wafer capacity. Thus, underutilization in our fabs early this fiscal year transitions to structurally lower wafer capacity at higher utilization rates as we move through the fiscal year. Reports indicate that this redeployment of underutilized tools at the leading edge is an industry-wide practice that is likely to constrain industry supply in 2024. Taking all these factors into account, Micron's bit supply growth in fiscal 2024 is planned to be well below demand growth for both DRAM and NAND, and we expect to decrease our days of inventory in fiscal year 2024. We expect calendar 2024 industry supply to be below demand for both DRAM and NAND, which will result in a contraction of industry inventory levels."", ""As we have highlighted before, we continue to work with the US government and CHIPS grants are assumed in our CapEx plans for fiscal 2024. The viability and global competitiveness of our Idaho and New York projects depends on Micron receiving CHIPS grants to address the cost difference compared to overseas expansion. To better support our customers around the globe, we have opened state-of-the-art assembly and test facilities in Malaysia and Taiwan. We are proceeding with our previously announced expansion of our Xi'an facility, having received approval from Chinese authorities for our planned investment. In fiscal Q1, we achieved the first mobile customer qualification of LPDRAM assembled at our Xi'an site, furthering our strong commitment to serve our mobile customers in China."", 'Our broad, diverse network of global operations remains a key element of our strategy to address customer demand in a reliable and resilient fashion. Our leading technology, strengthening product portfolio, strong manufacturing capabilities, and our dedicated team members position us well to capture the opportunities ahead. I will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.', ""Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered strong results in fiscal Q1 with revenue, gross margin, and EPS higher than the upper end of the guidance range we provided in our last earnings call. During the quarter, an improving supply-demand environment and our team's strong execution resulted in higher prices across DRAM and NAND. The current pricing trajectory has improved our financial outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Total fiscal Q1 revenue was approximately $4.7 billion, up 18% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. Fiscal Q1 DRAM revenue was $3.4 billion, representing 73% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 24% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the low-20s percentage range and prices increasing in the low-single-digit percentage range."", ""Robust bookings entering the quarter, including customer strategic buys that occurred in prior quarters for fiscal Q1 shipment, limited our reported fiscal Q1 DRAM price increases despite Micron's strong execution on CQ4 pricing. Our strong calendar Q4 price execution contributes to our solid sequential growth in fiscal Q2, even with the effect of seasonality. Fiscal Q1 NAND revenue was $1.2 billion, representing 26% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 2% sequentially with pricing more than offsetting an expected and communicated decline in volumes. Bit shipments declined in the mid-teens percentage range after record shipments in the prior quarter, and prices increased by approximately 20%. Portfolio mix improvements in NAND contributed to the increase."", 'Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.7 billion, up 45% sequentially. Data center and client shipments strengthened in the quarter. AI-related shipments increased in the data center market and normalized inventory at client customers enabled bit shipment growth. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.3 billion, up 7% sequentially. Mobile revenue continued to show strength as customer inventories normalized and smartphone units and average memory and storage capacity growth at customers drove demand. Our mobile fiscal Q1 revenue almost doubled from year-ago levels. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1 billion, up 21% sequentially. Growth was strong across most end markets. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $653 million, down 12% sequentially due to sharply lower consumer component sales, partially offset by strong growth in SSD revenue.', 'The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q1 was near 1%, improving 10 percentage points sequentially and driven by higher prices and a greater mix of DRAM products. Operating expenses in fiscal Q1 were $992 million, up $150 million sequentially and in line with our late November update. OpEx increased on higher R&D expenditures and the reinstatement of certain compensation programs suspended in the prior fiscal year including short-term incentive compensation. We had an operating loss of $955 million in fiscal Q1, resulting in an operating margin of negative 20%, improved from negative 30% in the prior quarter. Fiscal Q1 taxes were $59 million, lower than the anticipated $80 million based on an updated view of projected taxes across the year, driven by our improved fiscal 2024 outlook.', 'The non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q1 was $0.95 compared to a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.07 in the prior quarter and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.04 in the year-ago quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, our operating cash flows were approximately $1.4 billion in fiscal Q1 representing 30% of revenue. During the quarter, we received $600 million in customer prepayments to secure supply for leading-edge memory products. Capital expenditures were $1.7 billion during the quarter resulting in free cash flow of negative $333 million in the quarter. Our fiscal Q1 ending inventory was $8.3 billion or 159 days, down from 170 days in the prior quarter. As mentioned in prior quarters, we hold strategic inventory stock associated with build ahead of products for cost optimization and risk mitigation.', 'Excluding strategic stock, our fiscal Q1 ending inventory days would be approximately 142 days, only 22 days higher than our target inventory level. On the balance sheet, we held $9.8 billion of cash and investments at quarter end and maintained $12.3 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility. We ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in total debt, low net leverage, and a weighted average maturity on our debt of 2030. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal second quarter. While we remain mindful of macroeconomic risks, the memory and storage market environment is improving. We expect supply-demand balance to tighten in both DRAM and NAND throughout 2024. Our leading-edge DRAM and NAND nodes are oversubscribed for the full year.', 'Consequently, we expect prices to increase through calendar 2024, driving improvements in our financial performance. Our leading-edge inventory is very tight, and we are also working to minimize pull-in of customer demand in response to higher pricing. As a result, our sequential growth in the near term will be driven primarily by pricing rather than a sequential increase in bit shipments. Both DRAM and NAND bit shipments are expected to decline somewhat in the fiscal second quarter. We expect our fiscal Q2 gross margin to benefit from sequential price increases and reduced impact from underutilization. We project the balance of previously written-down inventories to clear in fiscal Q2. We forecast operating expenses to decline in the fiscal second quarter on lower R&D program expenses and an asset sale previously expected to occur in the first quarter.', ""For the fiscal year, due to some higher R&D expenses including what we saw in Q1 and higher short-term incentive compensation from an improved outlook, we now project OpEx to be over $3.9 billion. We forecast a much reduced operating loss in fiscal Q2 and project a return to operating income in Q3. Our tax forecast for the year has increased from under $200 million to over $300 million based on an updated taxable income outlook. We project the allocation of tax expense across the year to be heaviest in the fourth quarter driven by profitability and other factors. As we've mentioned previously, at current levels of profitability, tax estimates and the distribution of taxes across the year are highly sensitive to changes in the outlook. We plan fiscal Q2 capital expenditures to be in line with first quarter levels."", 'We see operating cash flows improving substantially in the second-half of the fiscal year and are now forecasting positive free cash flow in the fiscal fourth quarter. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q2 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $5.3 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 13%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $950 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expenses of approximately $45 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect a loss of $0.28 per share, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, the industry environment is improving, and our financial outlook has strengthened for the fiscal year and beyond.', 'We will continue to take a disciplined approach to managing the business and remain focused on optimizing price, driving productivity, and controlling capital spend. With high levels of liquidity and low net leverage, we continue to operate from a position of balance sheet strength as we forecast a return to profitability and positive free cash flow. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.', ""Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. Over the last year, our world-class technology, business, and manufacturing teams ensured ongoing leadership in foundational memory technologies and the expansion of our industry-leading product portfolio. We are encouraged by the progress we have made on pricing, and we are on track to restore profitability more commensurate with the great value our solutions provide to our customers. We expect 2024 to be a year of recovery and can see the path towards a healthy supply-demand environment along with strong growth in critical new technologies like HBM3E. From the data center to the edge, AI has emerged as a significant secular driver that will further bolster the industry towards record revenue TAM in 2025 and drive growth for years to come. Micron's broad and growing suite of leading-edge products positions us well to capitalize on the immense opportunities ahead. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions."", 'See also 30 Trending Products to Sell Online in 2024 and Stagflation Definition: 11 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

(NYSE: UPS) and the Teamsters union reached a five-year contract without 340,000 UPS Teamsters hitting the bricks. U.S. members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union remained on the job through contract talks that would culminate in a six-year agreement, though Canadian ILWU members did walk off the job twice in July for brief periods.', 'Workers at less-than-truckload carriers ABF Freight System Inc., a unit of ArcBest Corp., and TForce Freight, the U.S. arm of Canadian transport and logistics company TFI International Inc., ratified their respective five-year contracts with little fanfare. The rail industry, coming off a turbulent 2022 when labor-management disputes came close to shutting down the national system, spent 2023 in relative quiet.', 'But there is a price to be paid for labor peace. Contracts ratified during 2023 came with employee wage and benefit increases. The gains will either be absorbed by employers, passed on to customers, their customers, consumers or a combination of all three. The mainstream media-coined phrase of the “summer of strikes” proved to be overrated. Still, the labor disputes in multiple industries, and the settlements that resulted, were sufficiently high profile to compel workers heading into 2024 to wonder if they too can get more than they have bargained for in the past.', 'One of the biggest stories of the year, the demise of the near-century-old LTL carrier Yellow Corp., did not involve strikes, but the destruction of 30,000 jobs, 22,000 of them Teamster jobs. It marked a sad ending to a 15-year odyssey that saw Yellow’s rank and file sacrifice mightily to keep the company afloat, only to see the company, and their jobs, disappear.', 'The Teamsters’ contract with UPS affects more union workers than any compact in North America. Yet it could be just a means to an end.', 'Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien took a very aggressive posture in contract talks with Big Brown. He did so for three reasons: 1. That’s who he is. 2. He wanted UPS workers to reap the tailwinds of a favorable post-COVID labor environment that they had missed out on having ratified the last contract in 2018. 3. He wanted to send a message to Amazon.com Inc. that it could nail down the same type of deal for its nonunion workers.', 'On Tuesday, the Teamsters issued a statement accusing Amazon of misclassifying delivery drivers as employees of its Delivery Service Partners (DSP), contractors who work for Amazon, instead of Amazon employees even though the drivers wear Amazon uniforms, drive Amazon-branded vehicles and take direction from the company.', 'The Teamsters’ efforts will continue to be met with pushback from Amazon. The company refused to negotiate with warehouse workers who have agreed to organize, and it shows no signs of backing off. Regardless, it appears that Amazon will become the Teamsters’ holy grail heading into 2024.', 'The Teamsters came away with what, by all accounts, was a favorable deal with UPS, though the company maintains that the increases, when spread out over the five-year contract life, were far from enormous. The rank and file won a roughly 10% wage increase in year one and a decent increase — though not as much — in year five. In between, the bumps will be fairly modest. All told, workers will realize compounded annualized gains of 3.3% over the five-year cycle, according to UPS.', 'The year ends with UPS trying to sort out the status of its volumes in the wake of the contentious Teamster negotiations. In late October, the Atlanta-based company said that about 1.5 million daily parcels had been diverted throughout the year due to customer concerns over a possible strike. That was higher than UPS’ original diversion estimate of 1.1 million parcels. About 600,000 parcels had returned to the network, with roughly half of that coming from chief rival FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX), UPS executives said at the time.', 'The company did not provide an update as of the third week of December.', '— Mark Solomon', 'Perhaps the biggest story in the transportation and logistics space this year was the closure of Yellow Corp. While the finger-pointing over which party is to blame lingers in some circles, the defunct carrier’s estate continues to be sold off in hopes of fully repaying creditors.', 'The last straw was a failure to implement a change of operations with its union workforce. Yellow was hopeful it could consolidate operations at regional carriers New Penn and Holland with its national YRC Freight network as it had done at its Reddaway facilities months prior. However, labor balked at the planned changes to work rules, which would require drivers to also work freight on the docks and at locations other than their home terminal.', 'A ray of sunshine came in the spring when it appeared the two parties would pull forward negotiations on their collective bargaining agreement and hash out a proposed change of operations alongside setting rates for wages and benefits. Negotiations quickly fizzled and the heated rhetoric resumed in short order.', 'Running out of cash and options, Yellow asked plan administrators to defer health and pension contributions and called on the White House to intervene in negotiations. The company even filed suit against the Teamsters for breach of contract, claiming the organization was negotiating in bad faith and intentionally delaying implementation of the changes even though it knew the carrier would run out of money.', 'The threat of a worker strike over missed health care payments was enough to force Yellow’s customers to seek other capacity options. Court filings showed Yellow had 40,000 shipments in its network the day the strike was announced. Shipments fell by 10,000 per day to “near zero” by the end of that week. On July 30 it ceased operations. It filed for bankruptcy protection a week later.', 'Some have speculated that O’Brien sacrificed Yellow to show management at UPS (NYSE: UPS), where it was negotiating a labor deal on behalf of nearly 340,000 workers, that it meant business.', 'The Teamsters claimed throughout the negotiations that its members had given billions in wages, benefits and pension concessions in the past. It blamed Yellow for years of mismanagement and said it wasn’t going to bail it out again.', '“It is not left for the Teamsters to save this company; we have given enough,” O’Brien said in June. “What happens next is out of our control.”', 'In the end, 30,000 employees were on the street, 22,000 of them Teamsters.', 'There were some LTL labor negotiations conducted in 2023 that didn’t include personal attacks and name-calling. While O’Brien vowed to “fight like hell” heading into talks with TForce Freight (NYSE: TFII) and ABF Freight (NASDAQ: ARCB), no fireworks were publicly visible although Teamsters at both companies voted “yes” to strike if certain demands weren’t met.', 'In June, ABF and the Teamsters reached a five-year deal that raised wages by $6.50 per hour and benefits contributions by $4.46 per hour over the life of the contract. Employees also received two additional paid sick days and one additional paid holiday, among other provisions. The contract covers approximately 8,600 workers.', 'In July, TForce reached a deal with the Teamsters covering 7,800 drivers and clerical workers. The package included wage increases totaling $4.50 per hour over the contract period, mileage increases and higher employer contributions to health, welfare and pension plans. Additional paid time off, work rule protections keeping road drivers from working freight on the docks and a requirement for new trucks to have air conditioning, were among other items agreed to.', '— Todd Maiden', 'This year began with fears that one of America’s largest dockworker unions would disrupt imports. It ended with the same fears — about a different union.', 'The ILWU represents dockworkers at the Pacific ports of the U.S. and Canada. The contract covering U.S. West Coast port labor expired on July 1, 2022. Talks dragged on into this year, with salary increases and COVID bonuses the predictable sticking points.', 'Work slowdowns ensued, but importers were prepared: A portion of Asia-U.S. volumes was redirected to East and Gulf Coast ports to hedge the ILWU risk.', 'A new contract agreement was finally reached on June 14. ILWU workers got their COVID bonus and a 32% pay raise over a six-year period.', 'Shipping’s labor saga appeared, briefly, to be over. Then three new plotlines emerged.', 'The ILWU’s American members reached a deal, but not its Canadian members. ILWU Canada went on strike on July 1, went back to work on July 13, said it was going back on strike on July 18, called the strike off the next day, then finally agreed to a deal on July 30.', 'Meanwhile, the corporate division of the ILWU was contending with a potentially crippling legal liability.', 'A jury in Oregon decided in November 2019 that the ILWU owed terminal operator ICTSI $93.6 million in damages for unlawful labor practices starting in 2013 at the ICTSI terminal in Portland, Oregon.', 'A judge lowered the award to $19 million in March 2020, but only if both sides agreed. ICTSI did not agree, and a second damages trial was put in motion, with ICTSI seeking $48 million to $142 million this time around.', 'The new damages trial was scheduled for February 2024, but on Sept. 30, the ILWU short-circuited the process by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in California.', 'ICTSI is vigorously contesting the move, claiming the ILWU is forum shopping. A hearing on the final confirmation of the Chapter 11 plan — which calls for the ILWU to pay ICTSI $6.1 million — is scheduled for late March 2024.', 'Yet another labor plotline features the International Longshoremen’s Association, which represents dockworkers at East and Gulf Coast ports. Its current six-year contract with employers expires on Sept. 30, 2024 — just over a month before the next presidential election.', 'In its next contract, the ILA is demanding “a landmark compensation package,” prohibitions against terminal automation and tightened language ensuring all work at new terminals goes to ILA members.', 'ILWU President Harold Daggett warned on Nov. 4: “Members should prepare for the possibility of a coastwide strike in October 2024.”', 'Thus, the coastal threats have reversed. In early 2023, shippers were shifting cargo away from the risk of West Coast labor disruptions and toward the safety of East and Gulf Coast ports. As this year comes to a close, they are shifting cargo back to the West Coast and away from a potential disruption next year at East and Gulf Coast ports.', '— Greg Miller', 'Compared with the contentious environment in 2022 and an inability to get a labor agreement passed without congressional intervention, the U.S. operations of the Class I railroads and their craft unions experienced a relatively more subdued 2023. Despite some disagreements over furloughs and crew consists, individual unions reached sick leave agreements with the various Class I railroads throughout the year; some railroads, such as Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC), even reached agreements on work schedules. Both the sick leave and work scheduling agreements were not part of the labor agreements ratified by the railroads and unions in December 2022.', 'However, what happens in 2024 in rail labor-railroad relations could serve as an indicator for how the next bargaining round will go. The next bargaining round will officially kick off in January 2025 with preliminary negotiations, but both sides could start gearing up in the second half of 2024.', '“The railroads are committed to working with rail labor, delivering on their promises and maintaining railroading’s place among the best jobs in our economy,” Brendan Branon, chairman of the National Railway Labor Conference and the National Carriers’ Conference Committee (NCCC), told FreightWaves in an emailed statement. NCCC represents the freight railroads at the bargaining table.', 'Branon noted the railroads and the unions in 2023 reached local agreements expanding paid sick leave to more than 90% of all unionized rail employees at NCCC rail carriers.', '“We hope to extend that positive momentum throughout 2024 and into the start of the next bargaining round. The most recent national agreements provide that opening proposals can be served starting in November 2024 ahead of the January 1, 2025 amendable date,” Branon said.', '— Joanna Marsh', 'For the second time in four years, Mack Truck workers went on strike against the Volvo Group subsidiary. The Oct. 9 walkout caught the company by surprise because it had reached a tentative agreement Oct. 1 endorsed by both local and international UAW leaders.', 'Outside influences appeared to prompt the 39-day walkout. An ongoing UAW strike of the Detroit Three automakers caught the attention of Mack workers, who saw the more substantial offers being made by the automakers to the union.', 'And the World Socialist Website (WSWS), which had backed Mack employee Will Lehman in an unsuccessful bid for president of the international UAW earlier in the year, agitated workers to vote down the tentative agreement, which they did by 73%.', 'The two sides resumed talks, but Mack made it clear it had nothing more to offer, other than settling some unresolved local agreements. The strike involved 3,900 workers at facilities in Pennsylvania, Florida and Maryland, where a Hagerstown engine plant provides powertrains for Mack and Volvo Truck North America operations.', 'After the staredown, union leaders took a second vote on the agreement that called for 19% pay hikes across five years, a $3,500 signing bonus and no out-of-pocket increases in benefit costs plus other gains. The company called the Oct. 1 tentative pact its “last, best and final” offer.', 'Mack threatened to declare an impasse, hire temporary workers and make existing workers fight for their jobs. The second vote Nov. 15 passed with 93% in favor.', 'The WSWS railed against the “sellout contract” that Mack pushed for ratification as well as agreements with better terms eventually reached by Detroit’s Big Three.', '— Alan Adler', 'It was a busy year for labor contracts in the airline and air cargo sectors. The threat of disruption loomed over some carriers as unions flexed their muscle to influence negotiations and new deals significantly raised operating costs.', 'Pilot unions were able to take advantage of favorable economic conditions — a tight labor market, high inflation, crew shortages at mainline carriers as they tried to rebuild after pandemic-driven layoffs and a training backlog for new hires — to get better pay and work schedules.', 'A number of major passenger airlines reached collective bargaining agreements with cockpit crews. Delta Air Lines pilots finalized a contract that includes a 34% raise over four years. In September, pilots at United Airlines approved a new contract that raised pay up to 40%. American Airlines pilots also received a big raise. And Hawaiian Airlines pilots, including those hired to fly the company’s first freighters for Amazon, reached a deal that raised pay up to 33%.', 'Southwest Airlines pilots struck a tentative deal this week after earlier giving union leaders leeway to call a strike. Strikes are rare in aviation, in part because of federal law that severely restricts the ability of unions or management to shut down operations for leverage.', 'Miami-based cargo operator Amerijet agreed last summer to raise pilot pay at least 45% in a three-year deal with the union. The pay hike came against the backdrop of sharply lower revenues because of weak market conditions, with the company laying off some back-office personnel, offshoring accounting functions and parking some aircraft to make ends meet.', 'Last month, pilots at cargo airline Air Transport International laid the groundwork for union leaders to call a strike when legally allowed. The company is one of the main transportation providers for Amazon Air and DHL Express in the U.S.', 'Pilots at Western Global Airlines unionized in 2021 and were seeking their first contract when the carrier filed for bankruptcy protection in August. The company exited the bankruptcy process earlier this month after disposing the bulk of its liabilities.', 'In July, pilots at FedEx Express voted to reject a proposed deal between management and union negotiators. The deal would have raised pay by 30% over five years. Pilots had authorized union leadership to initiate a strike vote before union negotiators reached agreement May 30 on a new deal.', 'Pilots who voted against the FedEx deal complained about weaker job protections, back pay and alternative pension options and said pay increases were below those achieved by pilots at Delta, United and American. FedEx has too many pilots for fewer needed routes and last month urged some to consider jumping to regional carrier PSA Airlines.', 'Meanwhile, 1,100 ramp workers at DHL Express’ Cincinnati air hub went on strike on Dec. 7, with the impact spreading as Teamster members at other U.S. locations honored the picket line and refused to report for work. An agreement between the two sides was reached 12 days later.', '— Eric Kulisch', 'The post Labor 2023: A lot of noise but few strikes appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

He's called the Oracle of Omaha, but even Buffett knows that such near-term predictions usually fall short."", ""But I'm about to give it a shot anyway. I fully realize the folly of attempting something that Buffett wouldn't do. However, I nonetheless predict that three of the stocks he owns will be his biggest winners in 2024. Here are those stocks (listed in alphabetical order), along with why I have great expectations for each one."", ""American Express (NYSE: AXP) emerged as one of Buffett's best-performing stocks this year. Shares of the financial services giant were in negative territory as recently as October. However, a fourth-quarter surge now has the stock on track to finish 2023 up more than 25%."", ""I think that AmEx's momentum will continue into the new year. Why? For one thing, business is booming. The company reported its sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue in the third quarter. Its earnings per share soared 34% year over year to an all-time high."", 'Macroeconomic factors also appear to bode well for American Express in 2024. Inflation, although still higher than the Federal Reserve would like it to be, has moderated considerably. Unemployment levels are low historically. And the prospects for the Fed to cut interest rates next year appear to be pretty good.', 'These should be tailwinds for other Berkshire holdings as well, notably including payment processing leaders Mastercard and Visa. However, I picked American Express as a likely bigger winner in large part because of its low valuation. Its shares currently trade at less than 14.8 times expected earnings.', 'D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) has been an even more impressive winner for Buffett this year than American Express. Shares of the homebuilder have skyrocketed by nearly 70%. As was the case with AmEx, most of those gains came in the final two and a half months of the year.', 'I predict D.R. Horton will be one of the best Buffett stocks of the new year for a couple of reasons. The first ties in with the macroeconomic factors that should help American Express. In particular, I think that the potential for interest rate cuts could boost home sales, especially in the second half of 2024.', ""The second is that there's still an acute housing shortage in this country. Bank of America published a paper a few months ago that stated the U.S. needs another 4 million houses."", ""D.R. Horton is uniquely positioned to benefit from lower interest rates and the need for more housing. It's the largest homebuilder by volume in the country, a distinction it has held since 2002. The company operates in 33 states."", ""What's more, the stock is cheap -- especially considering the company's growth prospects. D.R. Horton's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a low 0.64."", ""Unlike American Express and D.R. Horton, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) hasn't been a great stock for Buffett in 2023. However, I think that sets the stage for a much better performance in 2024."", ""First of all, Occidental's valuation is attractive. Its shares trade at only 11.3 times expected earnings. I suspect this will entice Buffett to buy even more of the stock in 2024. Berkshire secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of the company's shares. So far, it has bought 27.2%."", ""I think there's a real possibility that Berkshire will aggressively add to its stake in Occidental in the coming months. If this happens, it could ignite a broader buying frenzy that pushes the stock price much higher."", ""Of course, Occidental's fortunes hinge on oil prices. However, Goldman Sachs projects that Brent crude will hit $85 per barrel by mid-2024. That's higher than the current price of a little under $77 per barrel. If Goldman Sachs is right, Occidental should be in good shape in 2024 -- and so should Buffett."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Occidental Petroleum wasn't one of them.

He's called the Oracle of Omaha, but even Buffett knows that such near-term predictions usually fall short."", ""But I'm about to give it a shot anyway. I fully realize the folly of attempting something that Buffett wouldn't do. However, I nonetheless predict that three of the stocks he owns will be his biggest winners in 2024. Here are those stocks (listed in alphabetical order), along with why I have great expectations for each one."", ""American Express (NYSE: AXP) emerged as one of Buffett's best-performing stocks this year. Shares of the financial services giant were in negative territory as recently as October. However, a fourth-quarter surge now has the stock on track to finish 2023 up more than 25%."", ""I think that AmEx's momentum will continue into the new year. Why? For one thing, business is booming. The company reported its sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue in the third quarter. Its earnings per share soared 34% year over year to an all-time high."", 'Macroeconomic factors also appear to bode well for American Express in 2024. Inflation, although still higher than the Federal Reserve would like it to be, has moderated considerably. Unemployment levels are low historically. And the prospects for the Fed to cut interest rates next year appear to be pretty good.', 'These should be tailwinds for other Berkshire holdings as well, notably including payment processing leaders Mastercard and Visa. However, I picked American Express as a likely bigger winner in large part because of its low valuation. Its shares currently trade at less than 14.8 times expected earnings.', 'D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) has been an even more impressive winner for Buffett this year than American Express. Shares of the homebuilder have skyrocketed by nearly 70%. As was the case with AmEx, most of those gains came in the final two and a half months of the year.', 'I predict D.R. Horton will be one of the best Buffett stocks of the new year for a couple of reasons. The first ties in with the macroeconomic factors that should help American Express. In particular, I think that the potential for interest rate cuts could boost home sales, especially in the second half of 2024.', ""The second is that there's still an acute housing shortage in this country. Bank of America published a paper a few months ago that stated the U.S. needs another 4 million houses."", ""D.R. Horton is uniquely positioned to benefit from lower interest rates and the need for more housing. It's the largest homebuilder by volume in the country, a distinction it has held since 2002. The company operates in 33 states."", ""What's more, the stock is cheap -- especially considering the company's growth prospects. D.R. Horton's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a low 0.64."", ""Unlike American Express and D.R. Horton, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) hasn't been a great stock for Buffett in 2023. However, I think that sets the stage for a much better performance in 2024."", ""First of all, Occidental's valuation is attractive. Its shares trade at only 11.3 times expected earnings. I suspect this will entice Buffett to buy even more of the stock in 2024. Berkshire secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of the company's shares. So far, it has bought 27.2%."", ""I think there's a real possibility that Berkshire will aggressively add to its stake in Occidental in the coming months. If this happens, it could ignite a broader buying frenzy that pushes the stock price much higher."", ""Of course, Occidental's fortunes hinge on oil prices. However, Goldman Sachs projects that Brent crude will hit $85 per barrel by mid-2024. That's higher than the current price of a little under $77 per barrel. If Goldman Sachs is right, Occidental should be in good shape in 2024 -- and so should Buffett."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Occidental Petroleum wasn't one of them.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) share price has soared 219% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 23% gain in the last three months. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 11% in 90 days).', ""So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress."", ' View our latest analysis for Intuit ', ""There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""Over half a decade, Intuit managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 26% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 67.58."", 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', ""We know that Intuit has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Intuit the TSR over the last 5 years was 230%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""We're pleased to report that Intuit shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 63% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 27%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

Butterfield & Son (NYSE: NTB) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors for their compelling combination of income and upside. That's why they firmly believe investors won't regret buying shares at their current prices."", ""Tyler Crowe (LyondellBasell Industries): Chemical and plastic manufacturing has, historically, been a good business for long-term-minded investors. It's a cyclical business, and its profitability can swing based on the price of feedstock, typically oil or natural gas. Still, global demand has grown steadily for decades as people around the world move up the socioeconomic ladder and, inevitably, use more plastic and other chemicals."", 'LyondellBasell has been in the chemical and plastics business for decades. It is the largest manufacturer of polypropylene and polyethylene in Europe, the No. 2 producer of those products in the U.S., and the No. 5 producer of olefins globally.', 'Two things stand out at LyondellBasell that make it a compelling high-yield investment. For one, its shareholder returns have been spectacular. It has grown its base dividend by 22% annually since 2011 and has paid multiple special dividends and bought back considerable amounts of its own stock.', 'The other intriguing element to LyondellBasell is its big push into circular plastic production. It has developed several innovative processes for breaking produced plastics back into base chemicals that can then be used for the production of new products. Management estimates its circular plastics will sell for higher prices than base plastics and have lower feedstock costs. Combined, the two should increase margins and profits.', 'Today, the stock yields about 5.2% with a modest balance sheet and some impressive prospects for growth in the next few years. That looks like a good combination for a reliable and growing dividend for several years to come.', 'Matt DiLallo (Realty Income): Realty Income has been an extremely reliable dividend payer over the years. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has increased its payout 123 times since its public market listing in 1994, including five times this year. That steady growth should continue, making it a no-brainer for income-seeking investors. ', 'The REIT already has a great head start on its 2024 growth plan. In October, it sealed a deal to buy fellow REIT Spirit Realty for $9.3 billion. The company expects that acquisition to close early next year. It should boost its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by over 2.5% per share in the coming year. That will put it more than halfway to its target of growing its FFO per share by 4% to 5% per year. ', 'Meanwhile, the combined company expects to produce over $800 million in excess free cash flow after paying its high-yielding dividend (recently around 5.4%). That cash and its elite balance sheet give it ample capital to invest in more income-producing properties. The REIT has been spreading its wings by expanding into new areas. For example, over the past several quarters, it has added data centers, gaming properties, consumer-centric medical facilities, and vertical farming investments to its portfolio. It has also continued its international expansion and added a credit investment platform. ', 'Shares of Realty Income have slumped more than 10% over the past year over concerns about rising interest rates. However, that headwind should fade in 2024, given the expectation that rates will begin to fall. The currently lower share price makes Realty Income look like even more of a no-brainer investment right now. It enables investors to lock in a higher-yielding dividend that should keep rising in the future. That income, along with its earnings growth, puts the REIT in a strong position to produce double-digit annualized total returns from here. ', ""Jason Hall (Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son): 2023 hasn't been a great year for banks. The banking collapses of the spring shook the confidence of many investors, while the ongoing pressures of higher interest rates on balance sheets has affected the bottom lines of a few. But one bank that's built well to profit in the current environment, and a future of rates higher than most have seen in decades, is N.T. Butterfield. Based in Bermuda, Butterfield operates there as well as the Cayman Islands, and the Channel Islands off the coast of the U.K. and Europe. Often considered tax havens, these locations are certainly favored by many of the global elite, and Butterfield has had a presence in these markets for well over a century."", ""Despite this long presence as a valued bank in its core markets, since its IPO in late 2016, it's been a bit of a middling investment. Shares are up only 31%, while its dividend-included returns are 88%; however, that lags the market by about more than 60 percentage points."", ""That's partly due to a pretty exuberant IPO debut price, as well as the 2023 banking crisis, but it's also a result of its relatively slow growth profile."", 'But that doesn\'t mean investors should avoid it. To the contrary, I think it\'s an absolute steal. Shares trade for less than 7 times trailing earnings, and the dividend yield is almost 5.5% at recent prices. Even its price-to-book value of just under 2 is cheap for this bank based on its incredible profitability. It has earned 26.5% return on equity over the past year, and a 1.72% return on assets.

Similarly, there have been reservations about the sustainability of Petrobras’s dividend. However, the government owns substantial controlling stakes in these companies and is also a recipient of their dividends. For Ecopetrol, the Colombian government owes money to Ecopetrol due to the Fuel Price Stabilization Fund (FEPC). This fund aims to stabilize fuel prices for Colombian consumers. It bridges the gap between international and national Colombian consumer prices by compensating producers and importers for this price difference. The primary goal is to cushion the impact of global oil price fluctuations on the Colombian market.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the geothermal energies market, you can go directly to the Top 5 Geothermal Energy Companies in the US. ', ""Geothermal energy is a renewable, reliable, and clean energy source, produced from the heat energy of the Earth. It is an unlimited energy source that produces little to no greenhouse gases or other pollutants. Geothermal energy is generated from the earth's core, is transferred through the earth's crust, and can be converted into various other energy sources. It is an untapped resource that offers a more sustainable and cleaner path to fulfill our energy demands "", 'According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the geothermal energy market was valued at $62.65 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3% during 2022-2029, propelling the market to reach $95.82 billion by the end of the forecasted period. The increasing demand for renewable energy sources globally has led to an increase in geothermal power generation. Geothermal power generation reduces dependency on fossil fuels since it emits 99% less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels. It generates energy with relatively few greenhouse gas emissions thus resulting in reduced air pollution. Governments taking green initiatives are increasingly exploring geothermal energy as a sustainable and environment-friendly alternative to produce energy. ', 'Commercial and residential sectors in particular have seen a surge in the use of geothermal energy. The growth of the world population is directly proportional to the increased demand for commercial and residential buildings. Indisputably, heating requirements such as space heating and water heating are crucial in these buildings. The construction sector is exploring geothermal power as a source for district heating as it is more cost-effective while being used on a larger scale. However, the accessibility and availability of geothermal energy is a restraining factor that limits reliance on geothermal energy. The energy distribution might not be possible in certain areas, perhaps due to dense population, thus restricting the use to certain locations.', 'According to the report by Markets and Markets, another major restraint to the reliance on geothermal power is the difficulty in drilling and setting up a geothermal power plant and the costs. As opposed to drilling for water, oil, or gas, geothermal environments require much more advanced technologies. Several drilling dynamics such as efficiency and system performance require consistent consideration and make the process quite costly. Until companies develop efficient drilling systems that are cost-effective and safe, geothermal drilling will remain time-consuming and costly in comparison to the alternatives.', ""According to the report by the Centre for Sustainable Systems, University of Michigan, in 2022 the United States, Indonesia, Turkey, New Zealand, Philippines, and Mexico all held 74% of the global geothermal power capacity. Focusing specifically on the United States, in 2021 the states of California and Nevada came out on top, with the most installed geothermal energy plants in the US. The two states reached 95% of the country's total capacity of geothermal energy produced. "", 'North America in particular is the highest consumer of geothermal energy, followed by Europe as the second-largest market. While 10 European countries already have operating geothermal power plants, more than 20 countries are also developing their geothermal power plants. The market in Latin America remains driven by fossil fuel-based electric consumption, geothermal and other renewable energy sources are slowly being integrated in regions such as Mexico. The Middle East and Africa are also steadily developing their renewable energy resources. Kenya is the front-runner in the production and consumption of geothermal energy, with 90% of its electricity being generated from renewable resources.', 'Major renewable energy companies are approaching the geothermal energy sector. Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) is an energy technology company that offers innovative technologies and services to industrial and energy customers. On November 29, the company announced that it was introducing ‘ThermaStim’, a low-corrosive, in-situ acidizing system. The ThermaStim is a never-before-seen method that enhances the generation of geothermal energy. This development by Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) is a turning point for stakeholders and energy producers as the ThermaStim causes no reactivity and corrosivity at the surface, thus saving costs on corrosion inhibitors. Additionally, by eliminating the need for acid tanks, Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) has created a safe and environmentally friendly technology for the enhancement of its production goals.

This accounts for 18.3% of the country's Gross Domestic Product."", 'Becoming a doctor in the US involves substantial expenses, with individuals often facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans. In February 2022, Forbes reported that the expenses associated with attending medical school can be equivalent to the price of a house. Data provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) indicated that the median four-year cost of attendance for the Class of 2020 fell between $255,000 to $337,000. The considerable expense of medical education has resulted in 84% of students graduating with debts surpassing $100,000, according to reports by the AAMC.', 'According to the AAMC’s June 2020 report, the United States is projected to face a shortage of between 54,100 and 139,000 physicians by 2033. While importing doctors from other countries might seem like a solution to alleviate the physician shortage, it poses challenges. Importing foreign doctors could potentially disrupt domestic academic institutions and impact doctors who have invested significant financial resources and time in their education. The Education Data Initiative notes that aspiring physicians invest around eight years in postsecondary education, encompassing medical school and undergraduate studies, before qualifying as doctors. Graduates of medical school, including pre-medical expenses, typically face a median educational debt of $215,100.', 'Among indebted medical school graduates receiving over $100,000 in scholarships, those attending public institutions owe a median of $115,000, while private medical school attendees owe a median of $130,000. Over slightly more than 15 years, there has been a significant 156% increase in average debt, with a nearly doubled expense when adjusted for inflation—marking a 372% surge in medical school costs. Notably, medical school debt shows an annual growth rate of 12.4%, while the cost of medical education increases at a rate of 2.5% annually. Projections suggest that if the current pattern persists, the average medical student debt could surpass $300,000 by 2024, outpacing the rate of increase in the cost of attendance.', 'These professionals have shouldered substantial debts to pursue their medical careers, and an influx of foreign doctors could potentially undermine their opportunities and financial stability. Therefore, reducing healthcare spending in the US requires a nuanced approach. It involves addressing the high costs associated with medical education while exploring strategies to retain and support domestically trained healthcare professionals. Solutions could encompasses incentivizing doctors to practice in underserved areas, implementing cost-effective medical education programs, and enhancing healthcare infrastructure to optimize efficiency without compromising the careers of those who have invested in becoming US-trained physicians.', 'The global healthcare industry is a vast ecosystem comprising various stakeholders, each playing a pivotal role in delivering quality healthcare services, advancing medical research, and shaping the future of healthcare worldwide.

So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) we really liked what we saw."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business.

Here are those stocks (listed in alphabetical order), along with why I have great expectations for each one."", ""American Express (NYSE: AXP) emerged as one of Buffett's best-performing stocks this year.

I suspect this will entice Buffett to buy even more of the stock in 2024. Berkshire secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of the company's shares. So far, it has bought 27.2%."", ""I think there's a real possibility that Berkshire will aggressively add to its stake in Occidental in the coming months. If this happens, it could ignite a broader buying frenzy that pushes the stock price much higher."", ""Of course, Occidental's fortunes hinge on oil prices. However, Goldman Sachs projects that Brent crude will hit $85 per barrel by mid-2024. That's higher than the current price of a little under $77 per barrel.
